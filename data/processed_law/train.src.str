[3] i am not persuaded that these are reasons either to not award costs or reduce costs. mrpaterson’s submissions are essentially the same as the arguments which were put forward in support of his claim and rejected by me in the substantive judgment. the submission regarding quantum has no merit. the costs have been calculated according to scale and are undoubtedly less than the actual costs incurred.

[3] i shall make that adjustment. the applicants also say that the respondent has claimed taxi fares to and from auckland airport and air travel costs for counsel to travel from wellington to auckland for the hearing. the applicants say that the proceedings were filed in auckland and as there is a crown law office in auckland, counsel from auckland could have been briefed to appear rather than incurring the costs for wellington based counsel to appear. [4] in my view it is not unreasonable for crown law office to engage counsel based in its wellington office which is its principal office and for counsel familiar with the matter to appear at the hearing. i accordingly disallow the applicant’s submission that there should be an adjustment on that account. decision [5] i make an order for costs in favour of the second respondent in the sum of $11,711.00 together with disbursements of $721.99. paul davison j prajapati v immigration & protection tribunal [2020] nzhc 2785.

[2] section 18(1)ofthe wills act 2007 provides that awillis revokedif the will-maker marries. so, underthat provision, robert’s 1992 willwould havebeen revoked by the 1998 marriage. but s 18(3) provides that s 18(1) does not apply if “the will does not expressly say that itis madein contemplation of aparticularmarriage . . . but the circumstances existing when it was made show clearly that it was made in contemplation of a particular marriage” and the marriage that occurs is the contemplated one. if s 18(3) applies, the 1998 will would be valid. [3] angela submits s 18(3) applies. she provides an affidavit attesting to the fact that she and robert did not realise their marriage revoked their wills. they both believed robert’swillwould remain in effect during the courseof his relationship with her, including if they married, without having to be updated. they were married for over 16 years after the will was signed. angela applies for an order that the will not berevoked by s 18(1)on thebasiss 18(3)applies. sheapplies foran order that service of the proceedings be dispensed with because all the interested parties, particularly brian and carol,have consented in writing to the orders sought. [4] the evidence, including the mirror provisions of the two wills leaving the estates to all four children if both die, show that robert’s will was made in contemplation that his relationship with angela would endure and would have the status of marriage. that marriage occurred. i am satisfied it is in the interests of justice that the will is not revoked. i dispense with the need for service and declare the marriage did not revoke the will. palmer j

[2] some of mr mcivor’s ill-gotten gains found their way to bank accounts of his brother, andrew. the commissioner restrained almost $386,000 and crypto­currencies now worth $1.77 million in his accounts. [3] the brothers recently agreed to forfeiture of all crypto-currencies and all but $400,000. i approved their agreement with the commissioner on 16 november 2020. [4] i was satisfied this outcome was consistent with the purposes of the criminal proceeds (recovery) act 2009, and the overall interests of justice. i reached this conclusion because the overwhelming majority of restrained funds were forfeited, and litigation over the balance (of $400,000) would be disproportionately expensive and time consuming. in short, i considered settlement met the public interest. …………………………….. downs j

[2] mr little claims 2b costs in the amount of $17,925, plus disbursements of $1,835. pointing out mr little failed on his former two grounds of appeal, mrs little proposes costs lie where they fell; alternatively, she should be awarded two-thirds the claimed costs, and mr little onlyone-third. practicallyspeaking, that is to claim anet payment of nearly $6,000 to mrs little. [3] the latter outcome would be to disregard the first general principle applying to determination of costs, that “the party who fails with respect to a proceeding … should pay costs to the party who succeeds”.2 irrespective of how they got there, only mr little was successful, and mrs little unsuccessful, on the appeal. mrs little was not prosecuting any separate cross-appeal on which she may be thought to have succeeded by setting aside the judge’s order for reference back to the judge.

[2] in a judgment delivered on 4 september 2020 we made an order striking out the appeal because the minute to which the appeal was directed did not determine any re: siemer [2020] nzca571[18november 2020] issue against mr siemer.1 hence there was no judgment decree or order2 susceptible to appeal by him. [3] mr siemer has filed an application for recall of our judgment focusing on paragraph 21 which read: [21] however the minute records that palmer j elected not to pursue the s166route. the minute itselfdoes not contain any decision or determination. hence the observation in the minute of cooper j that there is no live legal issue concerning any order made against mr siemer. [4] mr siemer challenges the accuracy of that paragraph, contending that it is a clear case of misstatement of fact and that correction is necessary to avoid appearance of judicial recklessness or impropriety. [5] there is no error in paragraph [21]. the essence of that paragraph and of the judgment as a whole is that in the minute of 28 february 2020 there was no determination by the high court against mr siemer’s interests which gives rise to a right of appeal by him. [6] in any event the alleged error in ourjudgment is not amattergiving rise to the exercise of the recall jurisdiction.3 if mr siemer wishes to challenge our judgment, then the appropriate course is for him to apply for leave to appeal to the supreme court. 1 re: siemer [2020] nzca393. 2 senior courtsact 2016, s 56(1)(a). 3 horowhenua county v nash (no 2) [1968]nzlr 632 (sc).

[2] the failing to stop offence was the first of its kind for mr manga. so, ss 52a(1)(a)(ii) and 52a(3) of the land transport act 1998 required a period of disqualification of six months. the reckless driving offence carried a maximum penalty of at least six months’ disqualification. under s 52a(6) of the land transport act, the judge was required to make these cumulative. so, the logical sentence was a period of 12 months’ disqualification. [3] mr manga was sentenced in a busy list. the judge might have thought the failing to stop offence alleged a third or subsequent offence. had this been so, the sentence would have been unremarkable. [4] given the acknowledged mistake, the appeal is allowed. the sentence of two and a half years’ disqualification is quashed. it is replaced with a period of 12 months’ disqualification. no other aspect of the sentence is changed. it follows mr manga continues to serve a term of 12 months’ intensive supervision and 80 hours’ community work. …………………………….. downs j

[2] in the event ms cullum filed a 22-page document entitled “public memorandum” on 6 october 2020 in which she confirmed that she would not be appearing at the next call of the proceedings. despite the length of the document it did not address any of the issues identified in my minute. instead ms cullum spent considerable time addressing an unrelated appeal that had previously been struck out,1 made a range of complaints with regard to the court process generally, and made personal attacks on a range of individuals including the respondent, the respondent’s solicitor, the principal tenancy tribunal adjudicator, the district court judge whose decision ms cullum sought leave to appeal, the deputy registrar responsible for the civil appeals list in the auckland high court and myself. [3] in the circumstances, faced with ms cullum’s wilful non-attendance and her failure to address any of the procedural matters requiring resolution, i conclude that allowing ms cullum’s application to remain extant can serve no useful purpose. instead i conclude, in the light of the documents filed by ms cullum, the appropriate course is to strike out the application as an abuse of the court process.2 [4] the application for leave to appeal is therefore struck out and i make an order for costs on a 2b basis in favour of the respondent. powell j 1 cullum v gordon [2020] nzhc 1261. 2 the application is struck out pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of this court. see siemer v stiassny [2011] nzca 1 at [15] where the court of appeal confirmed the strike out power found in the high court rules 2016 does not affect the inherent jurisdiction of the high court to strike out a proceeding (or in this case an application) irrespective of any application for strike out by either of the parties.

[3] the respondent was plainly the successful party and should receive an award of costs. with two exceptions, i award the respondent costs on a category 2b basis for the steps set out in the memorandum of counsel for the respondent dated 14 august 2020. [4] the first exception is that i decline to allow costs in relation to the preparation of written submissions in opposition to mr burmester’s interlocutory application seeking leave to adduce fresh evidence. from my reading of the file, that application was never timetabled through to a separate hearing. rather, all matters were heard at the substantive hearing. i am satisfied an award of three days to cover all written submissions is sufficient. secondly, i do not recall any case on appeal having been filed. rather, it was necessary for me to rely on the material contained in the district court file together with that filed in support of the appeal. i therefore decline to grant costs in relation to the preparation of the case on appeal. lang j burmester v norsand ltd [2020] nzhc 1945.

[2] mr hooker, who appears for mr su, says that there was a mathematical error in the court’s sentence. the calculation should have resulted in a sentence of four years, eleven months imprisonment. the recall application also seeks to reopen the judgment, saying that the court wrongly found mr su to be a driver and further that he ought to have been heard on sentence if the court was not to apply a discount for addiction which had been applied by the high court. [3] the short answer to the application is that there is no calculation error. thecourt rounded up the sentence calculation to achieve what it considered the appropriate sentence in the circumstances. that is the objective of sentencing. [4] insofar as mr su seeks to reopen the judgment, recall is not an appropriate remedy. following the supreme court judgment in uhrle, 2 an applicant must show that a substantial injustice has probably occurred as a result of this court’s judgment. a challenge to the merits must be made byway of appeal, not recall. mrsu’s pursuit of an additional discount is adirect challenge to this court’s findingthat addiction did not haveacausallink to theoffending. hisremedyis an application forleavetoappeal to the supreme court.

[2] the 2018 document in issue declares itself to be a will. it is typed, but is not professionally prepared. the document is witnessed by two witnesses. although it declares that the witnesses signedin thepresence of each other and the testator, that is not so. they signed at different times, but on each occasion in the presence of the testator who was known to them. [3] that is not the onlyissue. thetyped version leaves the estate, 50 per cent to a daughter and 25 per cent to each of two step-sons. there has subsequently been a handwritten alteration leavingthe estate 75 per cent to the daughter and 12.5 per cent to each of the two step-sons. onewitness recalls that the document was in its original unamended state when she signed. the other cannot recall. i note, however, the handwritten alterations are signed by the testator and not the witnesses, suggesting they were made subsequent to the original witnessing. [4] the three named beneficiaries are also the named executors. one has brought the application to have the document, as amended, declared to be a valid will of mrbarrycyril jones. theother twoconsent to theapplication. oneof the witnesses to the document says the original content accorded with discussions she had had with the testator. thereis no reason to querythe subsequent amendments which aresigned by the testator. [5] i am satisfied the document as amended expresses the testamentaryintentions of mr jones and should be declared to be a valid will. there is no basis to consider those intentions changed since the document was placed in its current form. ancillary orders [6] the application may be made without notice to any otherparties. order [7] i declare the document intituled “the last will of barry cyril jones”, being exhibit a to the affidavit of carl read-jones, to be a valid will. simon france j solicitors: langleytwigg, napier forapplicant

[1] in a determination dated 5 june 2020 i found that ms leckie had personal grievances against alliance group limited. the claim for reimbursement of lost remuneration was reserved for further consideration. costs were also reserved. [2] these issues were canvassed during a conference with counsel today. [3] there is agreement between counsel that taking the earlier findings together with the seasonal work dates, deducting ms leckie’s other earnings and applying the deduction for contribution generates a gross figure of $53,944.97 in lost remuneration. i fix that figure as the proven loss which alliance is to pay ms leckie. [4] counsel for ms leckie advises that legal aid costs are $3,822.00. ms leckie was invoiced other charges for work on these proceedings before legal aid was fixed. counsel sought $3,822.00 in costs. that figure is less than would apply on a daily tariff basis. counsel for alliance did not oppose an award of costs of $3,822.00. i fix that amount as the figure of costs which alliance should pay to mr leckie. [5] alliance should also reimburse ms leckie for the meeting and application fees charged by the authority. [6] i note that alliance challenges the finding that the assessment of ms leckie’s lost remuneration should cover from the date of dismissal until the date of the investigation meeting. the level of contribution is also challenged. the agreement expressed in [3] leading to this determination does not affect the parties’ rights on the challenge. philip cheyne member of the employment relations authority

[3] the second defendant seeks costs in respect of the successful applications for leave, particular discovery and substituted service. [4] in both instances, 2b costs and disbursements are sought. [5] the defendants have made efforts to resolve the question of costs with the plaintiffs. the plaintiffs have had sufficient time to respond to the cost memorandum. they have been reminded to do so. the successful party is entitled to an award. i am satisfied that it is appropriate to fix these in accordance with the schedules presented by the defendants. [6] i award the defendants costs and disbursements of $3,815.20 against the plaintiffs jointly and severally in respect of the plaintiffs’ abandoned application. [7] i award the first defendant costs and disbursements of $10,341.20 against the plaintiffs jointly and severally in respect of the first defendant’s applications. [8] the defendants sought a modest award of 0.3 day under category 2 for the cost memorandum. while i accept that the plaintiffs’ failure to engage on the question of costs led to a more comprehensive memorandum, i am not prepared in this instance to include an award for costs on costs. ....................................................... walker j

[2] we have granted leave on the first and third grounds. [3] we are not satisfied that the leave criteria are met in relation to the second ground. the focus of dr strange’s evidence was on statements made by the complainants in their initial police interviews about “blocking out” memories of the offending against them. there was no cross-examination of the complainants about these statements or on the topic of recovered memory. this was unsurprising given the defence case was about the credibility of the complainants and the allegation they had colluded for financial gain. as this court noted in b (sc 18/2020) v r, the admissibility of expert memory evidence at trial may be a topic that should be considered by this court but, as in that case, we do not see the present case as an appropriate vehicle for that to occur.2 solicitors: crown law office, wellington for respondent 1 the court of appeal heard the present appeal at the same time as b (ca463/2018) v r [2020] nzca 18, in which the appellant had also sought to adduce evidence of dr strange. an application for leave to appeal against that decision to this court has been dismissed: b (sc 18/2020) v r [2020] nzsc 52. 2 b (sc 18/2020), above n 1, at [14].

[2] in my judgment of 25 march 2020,1 i dismissed mr green’s application for judicial review against the chief executive of the department of corrections. the subject-matter of mr green’s application was his dissatisfaction with the way probation officers were administering a special release condition imposed by a district court judge pursuant to s 93(2)(b) of the sentencing act 2002. [3] because this was a civil matter, i said: [23] if there is any issue as to costs, the respondent is to file its memorandum no later than 8 may 2020. if a memorandum is filed, mr green is to file his reply no later than 22 may 2020. [4] on 3 april 2020 the respondent filed a memorandum seeking costs. nothing has been received from mr green. [5] the respondent seeks costs on a 2b basis. in my view that is the appropriate scale and i approve the time allocations set out in the respondent’s memorandum. decision [6] i award costs in favour of the respondent in the sum of $16,371.50.

[2] on 21 may 2020 this court received a request from mr harrison for a rehearing of the matter. a further request was received from mr harrison on 4 june 2020, with an explanation that, at the time of the decision, mr harrison was in france, a country heavily-hit by covid-19, where he was unable to contact anyone by email. he requests an oral hearing and again asks us to appoint counsel. [3] we treat mr harrison’s email requests post-judgment as an application to recall our judgment of 6 may 2020. [4] the general rule is that a judgment, once delivered, must stand for better or worse.2 there are, however, three categories of cases where a judgment may be recalled: a legislative amendment or a new development in case law of “high authority”; a failure by counsel to draw attention to a relevant statutory provision or caselaw; or “where for some other very special reason justice requires that the judgment be recalled”.3 [5] none of these grounds is made out. the application for recall of our judgment of 6 may 2020 is therefore dismissed.

[2] when the document was filed, the registrar advised mr main that this court only has jurisdiction to consider applications for leave to appeal against decisions of lower courts. there was therefore no jurisdiction to consider mr main’s document. unsatisfied with that reply, mr main applied for “review” of the registrar’s decision. michael main v new zealand police [2020] nzsc 55 [12 june 2020] [3] in accordance with the procedure outlined by this court in slavich v r, the registrar referred the document filed by mr main to a panel of leave judges.1 [4] we treat the document filed by mr main as an application for leave to appeal against the infringement notices issued. as we pointed out in an earlier decision relating to mr main, the jurisdiction of this court in criminal proceedings is governed by s 71 of the senior courts act 2016.2 section 71(a) provides that, in relation to criminal proceedings, this court’s jurisdiction is to determine applications for leave to appeal and appeals authorised by part 6 of the criminal procedure act 2011. in the present case there is no lower court decision against which an application for leave to appeal can be initiated. mr main’s document therefore asks the court to do something that it does not have jurisdiction to do.

[3] public trust in its capacity as administrator of the estate of sally tera baker, seeks an order under s 76(2) ofthe act for the payment ofthe balance held by public trust, together with interest, under the statutory trust to it as administrator of the estate. [4] whiles 76(2) of the act is silent as to whom the net proceeds of sale should be paid to, this court has accepted on two occasions that the former registered proprietors are the prima facie staiiing point for consideration of the issue. 1 [5] such an order is appropriate in this case.· accordingly there will be an order pursuant to s 76(2) of the act that public trust pay the balance proceeds it holds (including accrued interest) on account of the sale of 9 arahiwi road, mamaku (ct sal7b/841, south auckland registry) to public trust in its capacity as administrator of the estate of sally tera baker. venning j mclellan v teny hc greymouth civ-2010-418-132, 15 june 2011; and shera v public trust [2015] nzhc 3036.

[2] since the minute was issued ms cullum has provided further emails to the court, the latest one containing a 40-page submission dated 8 september 2020, but has confirmed that she will not be attending court in support of her application. [3] having read the various documents filed by ms cullum including the submission, it confirms my initial view that the application is an abuse of the process of this court. the language used throughout all of the documents filed by ms cullum, including the application for leave and the proposed notice of appeal, is in fact wildly inappropriate, consisting of sustained and gratuitous personal attacks on the respondent and a variety of other individuals, including the tenancy tribunal adjudicator and the district court judge whose decision ms cullum seeks to appeal. throughout these attacks, which are couched in extreme religious language, there is not the slightest suggestion of a bona fide issue that may call into question the judgment sought to be appealed. in those circumstances i have no hesitation in exercising my inherent jurisdiction and dismissing the application for leave to appeal as a manifest abuse of the process of this court. [4] the application for leave to appeal is hereby dismissed. powell j

[2] the gist of mr nottingham’s application is that crown counsel misled me at the hearingof his application on 17 april2020. in particular,mr nottingham contends crown counsel misled me in the course of their submissions as to the legality or otherwise of the (now revoked) order of the director-general of health issued on 3april 2020 (“order”). crown counsel deny misleading me in any way whatsoever. [3] although mr nottingham sought ahearingon hisapplication, iam satisfied i can deal with it on the papers.

[2] in a pre-trial ruling, chief judge taumaunu in the district court held that the evidence was admissible.1 the applicant applied for leave to appeal to the court of appeal against that ruling.2 [3] before the appeal was heard, the applicant entered a plea of guilty to an amended charge of receiving. he was sentenced on that charge to 18 months’ 1 r v gorgus [2019] nzdc 24941. 2 under s 217 of the criminal procedure act 2011. ashor christian gorgus v r [2020] nzsc 32 [9 april 2020] imprisonment.3 nevertheless, the applicant continued to pursue his application for leave to appeal against the pre-trial admissibility ruling. [4] the court of appeal declined leave, considering it no longer had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal because the applicant’s guilty plea meant the admissibility issue was moot. the court noted that the applicant had two options to contest liability: vacate his guilty plea or lodge an appeal against conviction. both would require him to provide evidence explaining why he entered his guilty plea.4 [5] the applicant seeks leave to appeal that decision to this court. [6] this court does not have jurisdiction to entertain an application for leave to appeal the court of appeal’s refusal of leave.5 nor would it help the applicant to treat this as an application for leave to appeal directly from the district court ruling, as there are no exceptional circumstances as required by s 75(b) of the senior courts act 2016.6 further, as the respondent submits, there can be no possibility of a miscarriage of justice7 in relation to the question of admissibility where the applicant has accepted responsibility for the offending and his plea has not been vacated.

[2] the respondent has applied for costs on a 2b basis of $8,028 and also seeks an uplift of 50 per cent from scale on the basis the appellant acted vexatiously, frivolously, improperly and unnecessarily in commencing and continuing the appeal.1 counsel submits the appeal was meritless and abusive, intended only to vex the respondent. [3] turning to the primary question of scale costs, i note that no notice of opposition was filed. the appeal was disposed of in the manner noted above before that step was required to be taken. accordingly, i do not award costs in respect of my work that may have been done towards providing that notice. i do award costs on a 2b basis in respect of counsel for the respondent’s preparing for, filing a memorandum in advance of, and appearing at the first case management conference. [4] mr purusram’s claim for two days for the preparation of costs submissions is improper. his submissions were only three pages in length, relied largely on the recitation of matters noted in my minute and (largely irrelevant) provisions of the high court rules, and made bare assertions as to the respondent’s entitlement to costs. i make no award of costs in respect of that memorandum. [5] a situation such as this which has ended speedily and not taken up much time does not justify increased costs. [6] the appellant is to pay the respondent’s costs in the amount of $2,453 in respect of the steps identified above. i would not in any event expect reasonable actual costs to much exceed that sum. hinton j 1 counsel referring to high court rules 2016, r 14.6(3)(b)-(d).

[2] some two days before his death, maxwell bruce stuart (the deceased) completed in handwritingin blue biro asingle sheet headed “mywill”. theheading was followed by a list of five christian names against which percentages were recorded in figures. underneath that was written “lynda share if she shall die before me then goes to her husband peterandrew srhoj”. thewritingis then accompanied by a relatively legible signature of the deceased and his full name and the date, 12september 2019 (theseptember 2019 document). [3] on 17 july2017,the deceased had completed awillwith the publictrust. that will appointed the publictrust to be the executor and trustee of the will and provided for specific gifts of personal effects and household goods, including any motor vehicles. thewillthen provided forgifts of the residue in defined percentages to the same fiverelationsof the deceased as arenominated in the september 2019document. in re estate m b stuart[2020] nzhc 529[17 march 2020] [4] thepublic trust has now brought this application seeking an order validating the september 2019 document as the last will of the deceased. the application is accompanied by consents completed by each of the five beneficiaries named in both the july 2017 will and the september 2019 document, albeit in different percentages. [5] the september 2019 document does not qualify as a will under the wills act because it is not witnessed. [6] i am satisfied that the september 2019 document should be validated as expressing the deceased’s testamentary wishes. [7] however, it is incomplete to the extent that it does not appoint an executor or trustee of the will and does not make provision for distribution of personal effects. [8] i consider the appropriate course is to validate the september 2019 document as a codicil to the july 2017 will, to be read so that the altered percentages for distributions to the five residuary beneficiaries are to apply as provided for in the september 2019 document. [9] the definition of “will” in s 8 of the wills act is clearly broad enough to include a document that the author of it intends to operate as a codicil, rather than as a fresh will. in reliance on the breadth of that definition and the terms of s 14 of the wills act, the originating application is granted to give testamentary effect to it. dobson j solicitors: the office solicitor, public trust

[3] mr lorigan, who is representinghimself, filed his leave application in time on 27 september 2019 but this court’s registryrejected and returned the application as it was not accompanied by the required filing fee, nor was there an application to waive that fee. mr lorigan sought a fee waiver on 11 october 2019 and this was granted, and the leave application accepted for filing, on 14 october 2019. unfortunately, the application was by then out of time. [4] given that chronology, the court would normally extend time. but infinity opposes an extension on the ground that the leave application is bound to failbecause it does not meet the criteria set out in s 214(3) of the employment relations act. [5] given the extensive background to the employment dispute between theparties, infinity’s assessment may becorrect. but weconsider mr lorigan is at least entitled to have his leave application heard and considered on its merits. theinterests of justice dictate that.

[6] the court ofappeal (civil) rules 2005 do not fix a sum payable for this step. by analogy with the high court rules 2016, 0.2 days is appropriate. under this court’s rules for a standard appeal, that comes to $478.

[2] on 26 november the application for a fee waiver was declined by the deputy-registrar. she determined that the proposed appeal did not concern a question of law of significant interest to the public or to a significant section of the public. therefore, the criterion in reg 5(4)(a) of the supreme court fees regulations 2003 was not met. she also considered that the criteria in reg 5(4)(b) were not met as the easton v attorney general (crown) [2019] nzhc 2910 (doogue j). benjamin morland easton v attorney-general [2020] nzsc 17 [6 march 2020] appeal was not in respect of a judgment issued in a proceeding commenced by an organisation of the type described in reg 5(4)(b)(ii).

[4] so, mr pomana you are free to go. ,,­ goddard j solicitors: k mills and a pearce, meredith connell, auckland (email: kate.mills@mc.co.nz); a ives and j reid, barristers, auckland (email: aives.barrister@gmail.com); i asked counsel if i was right to understand that no question of restorative justice arises and that no reparations are sought. counsel for the crown advised that is correct in respect of reparation. she had not had the oppmtunity to check in respect of restorative justice but given that the owner ofthe cabin is ultimately a corporate entity she agreed with counsel for the defendant that the issue doesn't arise. i did not consider that a restorative justice process would serve any useful purpose in this case in any event. counsel for the defendant advised he had spent about 13 months in custody. counsel for the crown was not in a position to provide a precise figure but confirmed it was a substantial period, well in excess of 3 months.

(b) that title in the share of certain property in featherston be vested in their joint names, with the respondent being removed from the title. [2] the applications are supported by a joint affidavit of the applicants sworn 31january 2020 and a memorandum of counsel. moore v mccluskey[2020] nzhc 164[13february2020] [3] the orders and directions referred to in paragraph [1](a) above are routinely given in matters of this kind, and are in order here. [4] therespondent was until recentlyatrusteeof the trust that owned the property in question. the application is made as a consequence of the respondent’s dementia which is described in a report from dr steve philip of the martinborough health centre and the joint affidavit of the applicants. i note that with applications of this kind it is preferable forthe court to beprovided with detailed information concerning the incapacitation of a trustee, but in the present case i am satisfied that she is incapacitated for the reasons set out in this evidence. [5] the particular orders that are sought are under s 52 of the trustee act 1956. although the respondent has recently been removed and replaced as a trustee under s43 of the trusteeact 1956 her name remains on the title. whilstshe alsohas given enduring power of attorney to one of the applicants, the orthodox view is that this cannot be exercised in respect to a person’s role as a trustee of a trust.1 accordingly vesting orders are necessary to effect a transfer of the title to the applicants as the existing trustees. [6] iaccept that such orders are appropriate. i accordingly order that: in respect of the three-quarter share of the property consisting of land in featherston, contained in the record of title wn15a/260: (i) cynthia margaret mccluskey is removed from the title of the property identified bywn15a/260.

[2] the parties have now agreed to resolve the claims by the court making a declaration. i was initially inclined to simply make the orders the parties had agreed by consent, but the parties have asked that i record the reasons in a short judgment. i accept it is appropriate to do so. relevant factual circumstances [3] the claims concern the actions of the department of corrections when transporting mr hartley on two occasions while he was a serving inmate. first when hartleyv the chief executive ofthe departmentof corrections[2020] nzhc 131 [11 february 2020] hewastransferred to rimutakaprison to tongariroprison on 30 november2016,and secondly when he was transported from tongariro to rimutaka prison on 14 december 2016. [4] mr hartley contended that his treatment on those journeys breached his rights under the new zealand bill of rights act 1990, and he sought relief in the form of declarations. [5] the defendant accepts that mr hartley’s treatment on the two occasions specified breached his rights under s 23(5)of the new zealand billof rights act 1990. that was so because he was placed in a situation where he was forced to urinate on himself and his clothing. in particular, the defendant accepts the plaintiff’s factual ascertain that during a scheduled stop on each of those journeys at manawatu prison he was not given the opportunity to use the toilet, nor were any alternative arrangements made for him. [6] the defendant agrees to the making of the declaration contemplated by the facts set out above, and mr hartley agrees with the defendant that a declaratory judgment can be given by consent. the balanceof the claims advanced bymr hartley will be discontinued by the plaintiff filing a notice of discontinuance. [7] i agree that in the circumstances referred to the agreed declaration is in order. accordingly i grant the following declaration by consent: that mr hartley’s treatment during his transportation by the defendant on 30 november 2016 and 14 december 2016 was in breach of s 23(5) of the new zealand bill of rights act 1990.

[2] i now have memoranda on costs from mr kerr for the official assignee dated 5 december 2019and mrmemelink seeminglyonhis ownbehalf and onbehalf of the memelink and vthe officialassignee [2020] nzhc 97 [7 february2020] trustees (of course he has no standing to represent the trustees collectively, but i put that to one side) dated 3 february 2020. [3] mr kerr’s two-page memorandum is straightforward. he says that the applicants were wholly unsuccessful and that, prima facie, the respondent is entitled to a costs award. on the officialassignee’s behalf he seeks costs on a 2bbasis. [4] mr memelink did not respond bymemorandum for two months. hisresponse runs to 87 pages. in effect itis are-run of allof the arguments advanced in support of theapplication in the firstplace, coupled with an attempt to introduce further evidence in the bodyof the memorandum itself and via various attachments and a great deal of extraneous material. [5] the position is very clear. the high court rules provide that costs are ultimately a matter for the court’s discretion. however, in the absence of special circumstances, the successful party in litigation is generally entitled to an award of costs, and these are calculated in accordance with the scales provided forin schedules 2and 3. thoseschedules providea3pointrangefor recoveryratesand a3 pointrange fortime allocation. thus, the2bawardas sought bytheofficialassigneein this case is the mid-range on both scales, and reflects the orthodox position. [6] i am not prepared in this costs judgment to re-canvass all of the arguments made on behalf of the applicants in the substantive hearing. it is sufficient to say that there is nothing in mr memelink’s extensive memorandum that comes even remotely close to persuadingmethat the circumstances of this casewould justifydepartingfrom the orthodox position which i have already described. the reality is that on the available evidence theapplications were unsuccessful, and plainlyunmeritorious, and that there is no reason to deprive the successful party — the official assignee — of her costs. [7] i order that the applicants pay to the officialassignee costs on a 2b basis as calculated by mr kerr at paragraph 5 of his memorandum of 5 december 2019, that is to say an all inclusive figure of $12,786.50. associate judge johnston

[4] in my assessment the first defendant is the successful party in an overall sense, but i accept counsel for the defendant’s submission to the extent that i agree that there should be some modest allowance for the success that the first defendant has enjoyed in securing the plaintiff’s agreement to give further particulars. i do not accept the submission that the first defendant is entitled to an indemnity from the trust at this point for his costs’ liability or the alternative submission that costs should be reserved. i am satisfied the fair course is for the first defendant to pay costs now so that the plaintiff receives some immediate compensation for the costs he has incurred; such an order does not preclude the first defendant from seeking indemnity when the question of overall costs is dealt with, at the end of trial. whether or not an indemnity is allowed will be a matter for the trial judge. [5] there is no dispute that such costs as are awarded should be on a 2b basis. [6] i make an order for costs and disbursements in favour of the plaintiff on a 2b basis, but with the proviso that there will be a 35% reduction in the overall amount claimed by the plaintiff, pursuant to high court rule 14(7)(g). along with the reduction, the amount of the award is $3,722.22. it is to be paid within 10 working days. associate judge sargisson

[2] when initially arrested mr burns was remanded in custody. hewas released to attend (successfully) a two-month treatment programme. however, he again breached the protection order not long after completing the programme. the judge noted the time already spent on custodial remand and concluded the rehabilitative sentence of intensive supervision was appropriate. [3] thiswas to includethe wearingof an electronic monitoringdevice. thejudge considered it would offer protection for the complainant and assist mr burns to learn burns v newzealand police [2019] nzhc 3195[5 december 2019] to live within the terms of the protection order and other conditions. the judge was keen to see the cycle of breach and imprisonment broken.1 [4] thesupervision is for15 months. mr burns appeals the monitoring condition, submitting it is too harshgiven the pre-trial remand he had served and the successful treatment course.

[3] whether a prospective change to settled authority is an available response for the court of appeal on the substantive appeal is not a question that could affect the determination that there was no justification under s 13 of the supreme court act 2003 for granting leave to appeal against the refusal to dispense with security for costs. the order for security for costs did not prevent mr stockman proceeding with the appeal to the court of appeal. he could in that appeal, if he wishes to do so, seek prospective overruling (a course the court of appeal might perhaps treat as indicating that the appeal against refusal of costs is moot). but his intention to seek prospective change to authorities under which he was refused costs did not itself remove the power of the court ofappeal to order costs against him if it rejected his argument. his appeal, though sought to be characterised by him as one that was not a “conventional appeal,” was an appeal against refusal of costs payable by the respondent and there is no impediment to the requirement of securityfor costs. [4] nothing put forward by the applicant raised an issue of public or general importance in the appeal against the judgment of french j. that was the conclusion which led this court to decline leave to appeal. no proper basis for recall of the judgment of 6 may 2014 declining leave is made out. there is no appearance of miscarriage of justice for the reasons given in it. solicitors: morrison kent, wellington for respondent

[5] j’s difficultyis that theproposed appeal raises no question of law, let alone one of sufficient importanceto warrant asecond appeal. hesays that hewas denied natural justiceand experienced delaysand procedural irregularities from the familycourt but the proposed appeal ultimatelycomes down to the proposition that he was not served with notice of the application or the hearing.

[2] before the appeal was heard, information emerged about the status of the reserve. this information led to the court re-visiting the decision to grant leave. and, after hearing from the parties, leave to appeal was revoked on the grounds that: first, the appeal was moot; second, it would be argued on a hypothetical basis; and, finally, the appeal would not resolve matters between the parties.2 leave was reserved to rangitira to apply again for leave to appeal if the position changed. in particular, at [15] of the judgment revoking leave, the court identified a number of scenarios concerning the status of reserve which, if they occurred, would mean the appeal was not moot. [3] one of the scenarios, identified in [15(b)], was that the reserve in question became classified as a local purpose reserve under s 16(1) of the reserves act 1977. the reserve has now been classified and rangitira has applied again for leave on the basis the proposed appeal is no longer moot.3 the respondent accepts the scenario contemplated in [15(b)] of this court’s earlier judgment has come to pass. [4] the position is accordingly that the proposed appeal is no longer moot. the court has earlier accepted the proposed appeal raises questions of general importance. leave to appeal is therefore granted. [5] in the circumstances, costs on this application for leave lie where they fall and we make no order as to costs. solicitors: natural resources law ltd, christchurch for applicant gilbert walker, auckland for respondent 1 rangitira developments ltd v royal forest and bird protection society of new zealand inc [2019] nzsc 6. 2 rangitira developments ltd v royal forest and bird protection society of new zealand inc [2019] nzsc 81. 3 no further evidence on this point is required.

[2] at both parties’ request, i reserved the issue of costs. i regret the delay in responding to the parties’ timely engagement on costs. their memoranda only were put before me for decision this week. [3] the defendants now seek 2b costs in the amount of $5,377.50, essentially on the basis their expenses in preparation forand attendance at the hearing were wasted. expressed in that way(and not as a(presently,unjustified) claim forindemnitycosts)1 , the claim relies entirely on my discretion,2 as the defendants do not claim benefit of any principle for determination of costs,3 and “increased costs” spring from such principled determination.4 thus the claim is just for the plaintiffs’contribution to the defendants’ expenses. implicit in the defendants’ claim is any wastage is attributable to the plaintiffs’ failure, here to express to the civil list judge the “cogent” and ‘efficient’reasons for the proposed adjournment. but the request foradjournment was joint; both parties bear responsibility for any shortfall in its expression.

[2] the application was called on 21 october 2019 (along with five other interlocutory applications brought by the same parties in litigation), that while broader in scope, encompasses the same land as that subject to these proceedings. given these other applications, there was accordingly not time to hear the application to sustain the caveat, and mr zhang, on behalf of mr mao, was in any event not prepared for the hearing to proceed, noting that the advice he had received from the registry was only that the application would be called. [3] in the circumstances, noting that the substantive proceedings are in fact complex and multi-faceted and that while mr zhang disputes that green land has a caveatable interest and is otherwise bound by a “no caveat” clause, i conclude it is nonetheless appropriate to make interim orders pursuant to s 143(4)(b) of the land transfer act 2017 sustaining the caveat until the application has been properly argued and further orders issued.

[3] thehearing indeed lasted onlya one-and-a-half-days. the time allocation for step 30 should reflect that. the same logic applies to step 34, preparation for the hearing, and a re-calculation is appropriate for both steps.3 however, i do not accept that 2a costs are appropriate for step 30. there were a significant number of documents in the common bundle, all of which needed to be read and checked bythe law society. just because it did not reject any documents, it does not follow that it spent no time on this step. as such a 2b allocation is correct.

[2] the application has been made as a result of mr soroka having been issued a police safety order pursuant to s 28 of the family violence act 2018. [3] a fundamental problem is immediately apparent with mr soroka’s application. that is, while s 3 of the habeas corpus act 2001 defines detention as including “every form of restraint of liberty of the person” and mr soroka contends that his liberty has been restrained in various ways as a result of the order having been issued, it is quite clear that habeas corpus in new zealand is firmly founded upon unlawful detention rather than the type of loss of liberty alleged by mr soroka.1 in particular it is clear “it is the detention or imprisonment … which must be impugned as lacking legal justification”.2 a police safety order is not concerned with the actual detention or imprisonment of a person. quite simply mr soroka is not and has not been in detention for the purposes of the habeas corpus act. as a result, mr soroka’s application must fail. [4] more broadly, a police safety order is designed to be a cooling-off measure allowing police to take immediate action to protect people at risk of family harm and can be in force for a period not exceeding 10 days,3 in mr soroka’s case, a period of five days. that is not designed to be challenged is evident by the terms of s 55 of the family violence act 2018 which protects “the crown and constable” from proceedings in carrying out the provisions of the act specific to police safety orders, provided they have acted in good faith and with reasonable care.

[2] ms thompson, through her counsel mr woodd, has now applied for costs on a 2b basis in the sum of $4,237 plus disbursements of $50, a total sum of $4,287. [3] in response, mr prescott has not challenged the calculation of the costs claimed by ms thompson. instead, by memorandum he has asserted that his appeal remains on foot and has also filed a further memorandum entitled “applicant’s application to stay costs pending a judicial review”. the latter document seeks a stay of any costs award pending “a judicial review of judge cunningham and an appeal as to the rights of self-represented lay litigants to claim costs if successful”. [4] leaving aside the procedural irregularity of what mr prescott is seeking, his appeal has in fact been abandoned, and there is no reason to stay any determination of costs given the costs relate entirely to the abandoned appeal. any subsequent actions taken by mr prescott by way of judicial review against judge cunningham therefore have absolutely no bearing on ms thompson’s entitlement to costs on the appeal. to the extent it is necessary to do so, mr prescott’s application for stay is accordingly dismissed. [5] having considered ms thompson’s application, i am satisfied it should be granted as sought, given ms thompson incurred costs on the appeal and it has now been abandoned. [6] i therefore order that ms thompson is entitled to costs against mr prescott in the sum of $4,237 plus disbursements of $50, a total of $4,287. powell j

[4] costs of $10,258 was sought by counsel for mr ma. these costs are specified in a schedule attached to his application. counsel for ms wang has responded on the basis that there had been a slight error in calculation, in that the 0.3 days claimed for appearance at a case management conference on 22 january 2019 should be 0.2 days. this would reduce the costs sought slightly to $10,035. no other issue was raised. [5] accordingly, i direct that the appellant, ms wang, is to pay the respondent, mr ma, the sum of $10,035 as standard costs for her failed appeal. i note, however, that ms wang deposited the sum of $2,300 in the high court trust account as security for costs. i therefore direct that that sum, together with the interest thereon, is to paid out to the successful respondent, mr ma. the difference between that sum and the sum of $10,035 is to be paid directly by ms wang to mr ma. woolford j

[3] mr gizelis voluntarily provided a dna sample but declined to make a statement to the police. [4] the prosecution led expert evidence at trial about the results of the dna testing undertaken. this evidence is described by the court of appeal as follows: [7] … scientists identified the presence of sperm in the complainant’s vaginal swabs, but no dna of any male was identifiable in that sample. tests were also undertaken on the seat in mr gizelis’s car on which it was alleged the intercourse had occurred. that only revealed a probable semen stain containing dna that was likely from the complainant and dna from an unidentified person. no dna matching mr gizelis’s was present in any of the samples. … [8] samples were also taken from the complainant’s undergarments. these revealed no semen, but the probable presence of saliva staining. this contained dna from at least three people, one being the complainant, but the remaining dna was found unsuitable for comparison. [5] a scientist from the institute of environmental science and research told the jury there could be a number of explanations for the dna testing results obtained.2 [6] the defence at trial was that the complainant willingly went with mr gizelis in the car after oral sex and there had been no sexual intercourse. the defence did not object to the admission of the dna evidence but rather, used it to support the defence. in particular, the complainant’s evidence was that she had had unprotected sex with the scientist explained that in samples containing a very high concentration of dna (not uncommon for swabs of an intimate nature), a high concentration of dna from the complainant would be expected. in those cases, where there is a lesser concentration of dna from another person, that dna may simply get “swamped out”. her partner days before the incident and the defence said that this provided a possible explanation for the sperm identified in the vaginal swabs. [7] in summing up, the trial judge, judge sharp, explained there was no obligation on mr gizelis to provide a dna sample but he had done so voluntarily. the judge told the jury that when mr gizelis provided the dna sample, “he could not be said to have been attempting to engineer a defence, because he didn’t know anything about the allegations that were made against him”. the judge also explained the effect of the dna evidence and in this context, directed the jury in this way: [46] … what that boils down to in legal terms is you don’t have elements that can prove anything in the case against mr gizelis. there is simply nothing that you could rely on to demonstrate that he had sex in the car with [the complainant]. you might find it from other evidence, but that evidence can’t help you. the aspect to that that he provided the voluntary dna sample means he put himself up for the testing to take place and you are entitled to take that into consideration. [47] now the other factor is the evidence from [the complainant], at least as she told it to the police, was that she was aware of the absence of a condom because she noticed stuff running down her legs. now this evidence might be hard to rationalise against the scientific material. it’s something that you will consider and it will be your view of it that's important. the proposed appeal [8] mr gizelis says the proposed appeal would raise a general question about the relevance of forensic evidence and that the admission of this evidence has given rise to a miscarriage of justice. in relation to the latter point, mr gizelis seeks to argue on appeal, first, that the dna evidence was not relevant because it could not show the dna could have come from mr gizelis.3 second, it would be argued on appeal that the expert evidence was inadmissible opinion evidence as it could not have provided substantial help to the jury.4 finally, mr gizelis wishes to argue that even if the dna evidence was relevant, it should have been excluded because the risk of unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of this evidence.5 3 evidence act 2006, s 7. 4 evidence act, s 25. 5 evidence act, s 8. [9] the admissibility of the evidence and the effect of its admission was considered by the court of appeal. in terms of relevance, the court agreed with the submission for the respondent to the effect that dna evidence, “is so much a stock part of investigations of allegations of rape that its omission would be likely to distract a jury”.6 in particular, the court took the view that: [25] … the fact such testing had been undertaken, along with its outcome, was relevant to the issues in dispute, irrespective of the outcome. the judge’s observations mentioned above acknowledge the forensic evidence’s potential relevance; this relevance being inconsistent with exclusion of the forensic evidence on the grounds argued on the appeal by [the applicant’s counsel]. [10] nor did the court consider that the admission of the evidence gave rise to a risk of a miscarriage of justice. [11] the court’s conclusion about the relevance of the evidence reflected an assessment of the particular facts. no question of general or public importance accordingly arises.7 [12] nor do we consider any appearance of a miscarriage of justice arises from the court of appeal’s consideration of these issues.8 the court made the point that, absent any challenge to the admissibility of this evidence, “and particularly where the defence was likely to place positive reliance on the dna evidence (as it did), it would have been untenable for the trial judge to take an initiative to rule it inadmissible”.9 in addition, any potential concerns about prejudicial effect were addressed by the directions of the judge set out above which were favourable to the defence. the criteria for leave are not met. [13] the application for leave to appeal is accordingly dismissed. solicitors: crown law office, wellington for respondent 6 ca judgment, above n 1, at [25]. 7 senior courts act 2016, s 74(2)(a). 8 senior courts act, s 74(2)(b). 9 ca judgment, above n 1, at [26]. both the question of whether intercourse had occurred and the complainant’s account focused attention on the attribution of the semen or probable semen she described feeling on her leg.

[2] on 17 september 2018 mr slavich sought to file an application in the high court to recall the judgment in that proceeding on the basis that fresh evidence had come to light. a deputy registrar refused to accept the application for filing. mrslavich requested a review of the deputy registrar’s decision. the registrar declined to action that request. mr slavich wrote to the chief high court judge, attorney-general v slavich [2013] nzhc 627. slavich vattorney-general[2019] nzca342 [29 july2019] venning j, requestingthat hedirect the registrar to action his request for a review of the deputy registrar’s decision. venning j refused on the basis that the deputy registrar was acting in compliance with winkelmann j’s minute of 24 march 2015 and that thedecision was therefore not amenable to being reviewed. [3] on 14 december 2018 mr slavich filed a document in this court entitled “notice of appeal or as the alternative a late notice of appeal” in which he sought to appeal “the decision ofjusticevenning or as thealternativealatenoticeofappeal of the minute decision of justice winkelmann dated 24 march 2015”. a deputy registrar of this court responded: we acknowledge receipt ofyourdocuments filed on13 december2018. this document has been accepted as a r29aapplication for an extension of time to appeal the minute ofwinkelmann j of 24 march 2015. [4] although mr slavich’s notice had been explicitly styled as the alternatives of a notice of appeal against venning j’s decision or a late notice of appeal against winkelmann j’s minute it is evident that the deputy registrar approached the filing on the basisthat venningj’s letterwas not ajudgment capable of appeal (it was not in the form of a judgment or minute and did not purport to exercise any judicial power. [5] mr slavich took a different view. he asked what the court’s position was on the application relating to the appeal of venning j’s decision. the deputy registrar confirmed the earlier position. mr slavich has requested a review of the deputy registrar’s decision not to accept the noticeofappeal againstvenningj’s decision for filing i.e. review under r 5a(3) of the court ofappeal (civil) rules 2005. [6] thedeputyregistrar acted correctly. venningj’s letterwas simplyaresponse to the request contained in mr slavich’s earlier letter. it was not a decision that attracted any right of appeal. [7] theapplication forreview is declined. onlythe application toextend time for appealing againstwinkelmann j’s minute falls for determination.

[3] mr williams applied for a recall of this court’s judgment. his application was dismissed, and he was ordered to pay costs of $3,500 to mr craig.5 [4] mr williams, by memorandum of 3 july 2019, accepts that he should pay the costs order of $3,500 on the recall application. he also accepts the disbursements figure of $10,872.26 with regard to the substantive appeal, as set out in the appellant’s memorandum of 2 may 2019. he, however, seeks a stay of the costs orders on the substantive appeal judgment pending the outcome of the retrial ordered by this court.

[3] the applicant did not challenge the crown’s evidence that there was central nervous system (cns) tissue on the shirt he wore on the night that the deceased were killed at the trial. nor did he do so in the pre-trial hearings.2 this was in contrast to the position taken in his appeal to the judicial committee of the privycouncil.3 the experts called by the applicant at the trial accepted the crown position, based on the ihcevidence. theapplicant’schallengeto thereliabilityandadmissibilityof the ihc evidence was rejected by the court of appeal after detailed consideration of the matters raised bythe applicant, which necessarilyimpugned the evidencegiven bythe experts called byhim at the trial. we do not see sufficient prospects of success in the argument that the applicant wishes to ventilate again in this court to justify a further appeal on this issue. solicitors: crown law office, wellington for respondent 1 taniwha v r [2016] nzsc 123, [2017]1 nzlr 116. 2 r v lundy [2014] nzhc 2527. the challenge to the admissibility of the ihc evidence was “maintained only formally”: at [16(b)]. kós j observed that the experts on both sides were in agreement that there was no doubt that the tissue analysed was cns: at [78] and[95]. thisaspect ofkós j’s decision was not challenged on appeal: see lundy v r [2014]nzca576. 3 lundy v r [2013] ukpc 28, [2014] 2 nzlr 273.

[2] the trust was settled by douglas storkey on 1 august 1995. mr storkey is now deceased. the trust was set up for joan. the primary beneficiaries of the trust are joan; joan’s nephews or nieces (john, gavin, bryan and janice); and the children of any of them. joan did not have children. john, gavin, bryan and janice all have children. under the trust deed the power to appoint new trustees vests in joan. [3] joan had a distinguished career with the new zealand women’s royal army corps and in 1970 was awarded an mbe by the queen for her services to the army. she is now 95 years old. she is in a rest home. a recent medical certificate confirms she suffers from dementia. jean is 90 years old. she also lives in a rest home and a recent medical certificate confirms that she too suffers from dementia. [4] janice applies for an order removing joan and jean as trustees and appointing kevin barton osborne (kevin) and bryan george dunphy in their place.1 kevin is the solicitor for the trust. bryan is janice’s brother, and a primary beneficiary under the trust (as a nephew of joan). janice also applies for an order vesting the orchard property (which is on two certificates of title) in the names of janice, bryan and mr osborne.2 [5] kevin and bryan consent to the orders. joan’s other nephews, john and gavin, consent to the orders. the children of bryan, john, gavin and janice consent to the orders. in short, all the primary beneficiaries consent to the orders, as do the new trustees. [6] i am satisfied it is appropriate to remove joan and jean as trustees and to appoint kevin and bryan in their place and to vest the properties in the names of kevin, bryan and janice. the orders sought in the originating without notice application dated 25 march 2019 are accordingly made.

[2] now perpetual seeks costs. it seeks only scale costs on a 2b basis. the governing principles are well settled. as a rule, costs follow the event, that is to say, the successful party is entitled to an award of costs, and the award is determined by reference to the scales contained in the high court rules. thus, prima facie at least, perpetual is entitled to its costs. [3] mr macfarlane has filed amemorandum in response to perpetual’s application for a costs order. he says that the case may not be over. he says that he is proposing to apply to the supreme court to recall its judgment declining him leave to appeal to that court. apparently, the basis for this is that perpetual, through its solicitors, has dealt inappropriatelywith chattels in theproperty. on the basisof the material set out in his memorandum, iam quite unable to see anyproper foundation foran application for a recall. [4] perpetual will have its costs which i fix at $26,537.00 together with disbursements totalling $4,349.46. these are the figures supplied by counsel for perpetual. mr macfarlane does not question them in his memorandum. i have checked the figures against the schedules in the rules and they appear to me to be correct. associate judge johnston solicitors: russell mcveagh,auckland for perpetual trust limited in all three proceedings

[3] however, the court of appeal made an order remitting the charges to the district court for the applicant to replead and for trial.4 the applicant seeks leave to appeal to this court against that aspect of the court of appeal’s decision. hesays the court ofappeal should have directed that acquittals be entered on the four charges. [4] the applicant also raises in his submissions complaints about other aspects of his treatment in the manukau district court. however, it is not open to this court to address these issues in the context of a criminal appeal. [5] the application seeks leave to bring a criminal appeal. the proposed appeal would be under s 237(1) of the criminal procedure act 2011, which allows for a second appeal, with leave, bya“convicted person”. in the present case, theapplicant’s convictionshavebeen set aside so itappears that heis no longer a“convicted person” for the purposes of s 237(1).5 it is not necessary to express a concluded view on that, however, as we do not consider that the criteria for the grant of leave are met in any event.6 theproposed appeal does not raise anymatter of public importance and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice in the way in which the court of appeal addressed the issue.

[2] for reasons that are presently unknown, the judge elected to deal with the pre-trial argument on the basis of the papers and without conducting an oral hearing. it is now common ground that the police officer who undertook the identification in question ought to have been called as a witness so that counsel for mr kumar could cross-examine him in relation to issues relevant to the issue of admissibility. for that reason both counsel accept that the process adopted by the district court was in error and should now be revisited. the issue is whether this court should determine the issue of admissibility on the basis of oral evidence to be called when the appeal is heard, or whether the issue should be remitted to the district court for re­determination in that forum. [3] mr kumar's trial is due to commence on 1 april 2019. for that reason i consider it appropriate to remit the issue to the district court for re-determination either prior to trial or during the trial itself. this will enable the district court to ensure that the current trial date is maintained. [4] leave to appeal is granted by consent and the appeal is allowed. the judge's determination in relation to the admissibility of the evidence is set aside. [5] it will now be for the district comt to re-determine the issue of admissibility either prior to the commencement of the trial or during the course of the trial. langj solicitors: crown solicitor, auckland new zealand police v kumar [2018] nzdc 19166.

[2] jean died in 1974. she had four children. under her will jean’s estate was to be divided equally amongst those children who survived her, subject to a life interest granted to one of her children which is now at an end. jean appointed two of her children to be executors and trustees under her will. the sole surviving trustee is aileen.

[4] the focus of mr prescott’s submissions is on the merits of his substantive appeal against the decision not to award him costs in the high court as a self-represented litigant. mr prescott does not seek to challenge the principles applied by clifford j in declining to review the deputy registrar’s decision. those principles were set out in reekie v attorney-general and were applied by clifford j in the present case.6 no question of general or public importance accordingly arises out of the approach to the application for dispensation and there likewise is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.7 [5] the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

[2] on 19 september 2018 he filed an appeal to this court. a date for hearing that appeal of 6 december 2018 was offered by this court. a difficulty has arisen because a transcript of the hearing is not yet available. mr gerritson’s counsel considers he will not be in a position to advance the appeal on 6 december 2018 because of the delay with the transcript. he therefore seeks an adjournment of the appeal to a date after the christmas vacation. 1 police v gerritson [2018] nzdc 11915. [3] the court can accommodate that and it is not opposed by the crown, but it will mean that mr gerritson will have all but completed his home detention sentence by that date. unlike community work, a sentence of home detention is not automatically suspended when an appeal is filed. [4] it is the appeal court which has jurisdiction to suspend a home detention sentence but it is the trial court which has jurisdiction to grant mr gerritson bail.2 i have no difficulty with suspending the sentence in the circumstances, but that should not occur unless and until bail is considered. as the court of appeal said in din v r, following the commencement of the administration of community sentences and orders act 2013, a person serving a home detention sentence is required to apply under s 55 of the bail act 2000 for a grant of bail.3 [5] i therefore make an order suspending mr gerritson’s home detention sentence conditional on mr gerritson being granted bail in the district court. the suspension will take effect if and when bail is granted. the appeal hearing is now set for 5 march 2019. 2 criminal procedure act 2011, s 343(a); bail act 2000, ss 54 and 58(2); see simon france (ed) adams on criminal law – procedure (looseleaf ed, thomson reuters) at [343.02]. 3 din v r [2013] nzca 610 at [6]. mallon j

[2] in memoranda filed prior to this hearing, both the crown and the defendant had modified their respective positions indicating that some matters that were initially proposed to be covered by the crown, and some matters that the defence initially took objection to were no longer an issue. [3] in the course of oral argument this morning, it now appears that there has been substantial agreement to the extent that no formal ruling on admissibility is required other than in respect of one point. this relates to [19] in the draft brief of evidence of mike jiang, and in particular the defence’s concern was that if the evidence portrayed a pattern of complaints by the deceased about actions of the defendant that would be unfair. but mr bamford, for the defendant, conceded that with the exclusion of [19], the material presently set out in draft paragraphs [22] and [23] would be suitable. mr webber has indicated that crown is likely to modify its position accordingly. i simply record that but do not make any direction that mr webber do that given his indication that is proposed to happen. outcome [4] on the basis of the modification by the crown of its position, the defence withdraws its objection to the admissibility of the proposed evidence and it is accordingly ruled admissible. [5] on a separate topic, the issue of an interpreter has been canvassed for various valid reasons. mr bamford is not in a position to express a concluded view but it seems that at least possible that a german speaking interpreter may be required and that is likely to be particularly so should ultimately the defendant elect to give evidence. as soon as the defence is in a position to advise on the issue of an interpreter, the registry official should be alerted accordingly. churchman j solicitors: crown solicitor, nelson for crown bamford law, nelson for the defendant

[2] thecasewas called again on12 september 2018,as at whichdate mr duncan’s offer remained the only one on the table. [3] the plaintiff sought confirmation that the trustees were to accept that offer. the defendant asked for more time. i indicated that i did not regard the court as having jurisdiction to extend the time agreed by the parties in their settlement agreement, and directed that the trustees sell the land to mr duncan for $1,875,000, a sutherland vwaitai [2018] nzhc 2877[6 november 2018] figure thathad in fact increased marginallysince27 june2018. iconfirmed that in a minute issued later that day. [4] in that minute, i also recorded that there was a suggestion that the defendant might be reluctant to sign the necessary documentation (the contract and related conveyancing documentation), and i gave the plaintiff leave to apply in this proceeding for an order pursuant to pt 5 of the trusteeact 1956 dispensing with the need for the defendant to sign that documentation if that became necessary. [5] by memorandum dated 26 october 2018 mr waugh for the plaintiff seeks a formal order in terms of the settlement agreement. healso seeks an order pursuant to pt 5 of theact in the following terms: this court, being satisfied that it is expedient to do so in order to give effect to the order madebythe courton12 september2018 thatthe trustees sellthe waipu land(as definedin the pleadings) to douglas mckelveyduncan or his nominee for $1,875,000, ought, orders that the waipu land be vested solelyin rere raima sutherland.

[8] if the plaintiff requires an additional order pursuant to pt 5 of the trustee act in order to be able to give effect to the order i am making, she will have to make a formal application, supported as necessaryby affidavit evidence, and that application will, in my view, have to be dealt with by a high court judge (unless summary judgment is sought). associate judge johnston solicitors: roger crowley, whanganui

[2] the properties had been declared by the district court to be abandoned; this pursuant to s77of the local government (rating) act 2002. thisentitled thecouncil to sell them by public tender and they were acquired by the applicant in 2012. after castle v whakatane district council [2018] nzhc 1687. marie deanne castle vwhakatane districtcouncil[2018] nzsc 99 [30 october 2018] she acquired the properties, the council sent rates assessment notices to the applicant giving her notice of liability for the rates owed in relation to the properties. from march 2014to july2015,the applicantmadeonlynominal payments towards the rates she owed. the council issued rates recovery proceedings in september 2014 and, after judgment was entered against the applicant, took steps to enforce the judgment. [3] the applicant’s broad position seems to be that her method of acquiring the properties means that they are no longer liable for rates and for the purposes of this argument she relies on the long repealed provisions of the sale for non-payment of rates act 1862. this statute provided a memorialising process associated with the recovery of rates and that where the rates in issue were later paid a memorial of satisfaction would be registered, discharging the land from the charge previously created. self-evidently, the statute did not purport to exempt such land from future rates demands. [4] in his judgment, woolford j pointed outthe governingstatute now is the local government (rating)act 2002 and that,underthat act, the applicant is liableforrates on the properties. [5] the applicant appealed to the court of appeal against the judgment of woolford j but this appeal was deemed abandoned as she did not provide security for costs. her application for leave to appeal direct to this court from the high court falls to be determined under s 75 of the senior courts act 2016 and requires her to establish that thereareexceptional circumstances which warrant the grantingof leave. this shehas not doneand the application is accordinglydismissed. sheis to paythe respondent costs of $2,500. solicitors: brookfields lawyers,auckland for respondent

[2] the application was referred to me in my capacity as duty judge. i directed that it should be served on the crown. i also set the matter down for hearing today, given the requirements of the habeas corpus act 2001. [3] ms mckenna, for the crown, filed helpful submissions. annexed to those submissions were various documents, including warrants of commitment signed by judge phillips in the district court at dunedin on 12 january 2016. mr fisi had not previously seen those documents. we went through them and he accepts that his calculations are in error. [4] i am satisfied that mr fisi is currently lawfully detained pursuant to a sentence of imprisonment of three years and six months imposed by judge phillips on 12 january 2016.1 it appears from a prisoner movements document filed by the department of corrections that mr fisi was remanded in custody on 25 august 2015. according to the department’s calculations, he is entitled to credit for time served of 140 days. ms mckenna has calculated that that means that mr fisi’s release date falls due on 21 february 2019 and not before. [5] so far as i can ascertain, the committal warrants are in order and there is no reason to go behind them. [6] the application for habeas corpus is dismissed. wylie j r v fisi [2016] nzdc 347.

[2] in his submissions, the applicant maintains that the overall sentence was excessive and complains that no discrete allowance was given for his mental health issues and remorse. thestartingpoint adoptedbythe judge was not challengedin the court of appeal. so we do not have theadvantageof that court’s consideration of the issue. the same is also true of the challenge to the undifferentiated and global nature of the discount for mitigating factors. in respect of this latter issue, there is also the practical consideration that, providing the total allowance for mitigating factors was appropriate (which is what the court of appeal concluded), its make-up is of limited practical moment. [3] we are conscious that the sentence imposed was severe. but, having regard to the considerations just mentioned, we have reached the viewthat the proposed appeal raises no issue of public or general importance and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.4 [4] theapplicant also seeks to challengehis conviction forusingafirearm against a police officer. this charge was laid under s 198a(1) of the crimes act 1961. he contends that he should have been prosecuted under s 198a(2) which carries a lower maximumpenalty. on our reviewof the summaryof facts, weare of the view that the charge in issue was appropriately laid under the former subsection. we note as well theapplicant did not appeal to the court of appeal againsthis convictiononthis charge and hehas advanced nothingto suggest that thereareexceptional circumstances ofthe kind which would warrant granting leave to appeal direct to this court.5 [5] accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed. solicitors: crown law office, wellington for respondent 3 at [7]. 4 supreme court act 2003, s 13(2); and senior courtsact 2016, s 74(2). 5 supreme court act 2003, s 14; and senior courtsact 2016, s 75.

[2] bc63891’s statutorydemand was ignored bycorsair. as aresult, bc63891 was obliged to issue this proceeding. when, after its commencement, corsair engaged with bc 63891, it put forward a series of offers commencing on 9 march 2018 proposing terms for settlement which were less attractive than the ultimate outcome and unacceptable to bc 63891. bodycorporate 63891 v corsair products limited [2018] nzhc 1844 [24 july2018] [3] accordingly, bc63891 continued to prosecute its proceedingas itwas entitled to do.

[3] mr rabson was advised ofthe fixture by the registry but took no further steps and did not appear. mr howden appeared and pressed his application. i conclude therefore that it is in order to deal with this matter in his absence. result [4] in the circumstances of this case, the commissioner's application is plainly well founded. both proceedings are struck out accordingly. [5] the commissioner will be entitled to costs on a 2a basis. there will be no order for costs in relation to the second respondents who abide. / malcolm edward rabson [2016] nzlat 33. at [32]. rabson v shephard [2017] nzsc 97.

[4] while i suspect that only half a day will be required out of an abundance of caution one day should be allocated. [5] given the scope of the hearing today i anticipate that the focus of the substantive hearing will largely be on: ( a) exploring the circumstances giving rise to s 18 of the reserves and other land disposal act 1959 (which will likely require further evidence); (b) legal submissions on the nature and scope of the rights conferred by (or underlying) s 18; and ( c) further legal submissions on whether those rights have been waived. [6] counsel may wish to consider the extent of any factual contest in relation to the last issue and how (if one exists) it should be resolved.

[3] instead dblargues that theappeal is hopeless onthemeritsand the application should be declined for that reason. but as the supreme court said in almond v read, applications to extend time for relatively minor breaches are not the place for close assessment of the merits of an appeal. 6 such arguments will not normally succeed unless the case is very weak or very strong.7 examples of weak cases offered by the court were proceedings unwinnable even on unchallenged facts; where there is no jurisdiction to consider the claim; where the appeal is an abuse of process; or the appeal is frivolous or vexatious.8 [4] this appeal is essentially about the correct interpretation of a settlement agreement. it plainly does not meet the description of hopeless from the outset. dbl’s opposition in this respect is misconceived. [5] theapplication for an extension of time to appeal is granted accordingly. [6] as the applicant is self-represented, there will be no order for costs. 3 in his notice of appeal, mr schutt said the appeal was filed just one day late, but this is in error. the judgment was issued on 22 november 2017. the appeal period expired on 20 december 2017. the notice of appeal and application to extend time were received by this court on 30 january 2018. taking into account the christmas holiday period, this makes it 13 days out of time. 4 almond v read [2017] nzsc 80, [2017] 1 nzlr 801 at [35]–[40]. 5 at [37]. 6 at [37]. 7 at [39(c)]. 8 at [39(c)].

[4] in making this substitution, however, the judge did not factor in the time mr wilson spent on remand before he was sentenced -from 14 january 2017 to his sentencing on 5 july 2017, a period of approximately six months. [5] it is not disputed this was an oversight. in making an order cancelling a sentence of imprisonment and substituting home detention, the court is required to take into account the portion of the original sentence that remains unserved. 1 pre­sentence detention -including detention on remand -is deemed as time served.2 the facts of this case are materially similar to kapa v police, where ellis j allowed the appeal and substituted a reduced sentence, taking a "relatively robust approach to the maths".3 [6] i am minded to do similarly.

[3] counsel for the respondent, by memorandum dated 5 april 2018, challenges both of mr mcguire’s propositions. [4] in accordance with the court’s normal practice, we invited submissions on what costs orders (if any) should be made on disposal of the appeal, at the end of the oral argument. it was then agreed by both counsel that costs should follow the event and that the costs should be calculated for a standard appeal on a band a basis. [5] counsel for the respondent suggests that mr mcguire’s present memorandum effectively amounts to a recall application. it is not so expressed. but if that is what it is intended to be, it is clearly unmeritorious. there is no proper basis upon which we could now purport to make some different order as to costs than the one that was made in the judgment.

in the high court of new zealand wellington registry i te koti matua o aotearoa te whanganui-a-tararohe civ-2017-485-1032 [2018] nzhc 1166 under the insolvency act 2 006 in the matter of the bankruptcy of kelvin smyth bet ween wholesale carlimited applicant s direct (4 x 4) and kelvin smyth respondent hearing: 22 may 2018 appearances: m belesky for applicant e cox for respondent judgment: 23 may 2018 judgment of associate judge johnston [1] on or shortly after 17 january 2018 the respondent served a bankruptcy notice on the applicant. this was based on a judgment originally issued by the district court at wellington on 30 october 2017. the applicant of course had 10 working days within which to respond. [2] on 1 february 2018 the applicant filed and served the application before me, that is to say an application for an order setting aside the bankruptcy notice. [3] the basis for this application was that the applicant had applied or was intending to a ly for an order setting aside the district court judgment. it is unnecessary for me to outline the basis for that application. the application for an order setting aside the bankruptcy notice being wholly dependent on the applicant wholesale cars direct (4 x 4) limited v smyth [2018] nzhc 1166 [22 may 2018] being successful in having the district court judgment set aside, the parties have been forced to wait for the district court to issue judgment. judge tompkins issued a judgment dated 7 may 2018. his honour refused to set aside the original judgment dated 30 october 2017 but entered judgment for a lesser amount, reducing the principal amount of the judgment to $8,353. [4] the question now is how this court should deal with the application before it. [5] having reviewed the file and had the benefit of submissions from mr cox and mr belesky, i am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to an order dismissing this application. equally, however, it seems to me to be appropriate to amend the bankruptcy notice so that it aligns with the district court judgment upon which it is based. [6] during the course of the hearing i enquired whether wholesale cars direct was prepared to agree to extend the time during which mr smyth will now have to comply with the amended bankruptcy notice. as mr cox said to me, there is no need for a formal extension because whilst there may only be a matter of days remaining before the bankruptcy notice period expires, the reality is that wholesale cars direct will not be able to commence proceedings for mr smyth's bankruptcy and get those before the court for some weeks. that should give mr smyth ample time to pay the debt or make other arrangements with wholesale cars direct. [7] accordingly, i dismiss mr smyth's application, and order that the bankruptcy notice be reduced to $8,028 (which takes into account payments totalling $325) plus costs of $796. il~a~[lj; associate judge johnston solicitors: buckett law, wellington for applicant gibson sheat, wellington for respondent

[5] after discussing the matter with mr dewar and mr denize, i concluded that the most appropriate course was to grant the plaintiff summary judgment, but direct that the judgment lie in court for a short time in order to give mr denize an opportunity to discharge the obligation. [6] accordingly, and by consent, i now enter judgment for the plaintiff against the first and second defendants in the amount of $1,609,113.34 which is the amount due and owing as at today's date, together with default interest pursuant to the contract at the rate of 14.75 per cent from today's date so that interest will continue to accrue at the daily rate of $632.43 down to the date of payment, and costs on a solicitor and client basis (as also provided for in the contract) of $10,925 and disbursements of $2,081.75.

[2] the respondent who had opposed the application seeks increased costs. he does so on the grounds that the applicant has acted unreasonably in the conduct of the litigation causing delay and putting the respondent to unnecessary expense. he v chen [2018] nzca 142 [7 may 2018] [3] for his part, the applicant says no costs should be payable. the only reason he withdrew his application was his inability to obtain legal representation. nevertheless, the fact remains that he filed an application which he later abandoned on the eve of the hearing, having breached timetabling orders. there is in our view no reason to displace the ordinary rule that costs should be payable. [4] as to the quantum of those costs, we acknowledge there appear to be grounds for increased costs. however shortly before the applicant withdrew his application, the respondent’s instructing solicitor advised him that on withdrawal the respondent would be seeking payment of scale costs amounting to $2,676. there is no evidence of any further work being undertaken by the respondent between the date of that advice (friday 9 march 2018) and the filing of the notice of abandonment (tuesday 13 march 2018). [5] in those circumstances we consider that only scale costs should be awarded. accordingly the applicant is ordered to pay the respondent costs in the sum of $2,676. solicitors: glaister ennor, auckland for respondent

[4] sentencing is set for june. in the circumstances, i consider the appropriate course is to allow the appeal and grant interim name suppression until sentencing. that will allow the district court to consider all matters. the granting ofinterim name suppression is intended to be completely neutral in its effect on the forthcoming applications. [5] the crown did not oppose this course, given the short timeframe. it was otherwise opposing the appeal, and would have continued to do so had matters remained unchanged. [6] the appeal is allowed. the defendant's name is suppressed until sentencing of which time it becomes a matter for the district court to determine whether final name suppression is granted. simon france j

[3] two days later, on 25 june 2017, arrangements were made for another justice of the peace to go to the deceased's home to witness the deceased's new will. the justice of the peace duly placed his signature on the new will as the second witness. estate of dullabh rama [2018] nzhc 768 [23 april 2018] [4] when the deceased's will was taken to his solicitors, mr govan was later advised by the lawyers that the deceased's will needed to be witnessed by two witnesses present together at the same time in the deceased's presence when the deceased signed his will. [5] the deceased died before there could be further arrangements for him to have his will signed and witnessed by two witnesses together. [6] the beneficiaries of the deceased's will are his five daughters, who all consent to mr govan's application, to have the deceased's will to be declared a valid will.

[2] the convictions resulted from guilty pleas entered at trial. mr whichman says they were entered under a misunderstanding, caused by trial counsel, about the length of the effective sentence that would result. he says that he protested at the time, trying to withdraw his pleas, but the judge refused to hear him. he accuses the judge, counsel and court staff of misconduct. whichman v r [2018] nzca 85 [10 april 2018] [3] admission to bail pending appeal is exceptional; the onus is on the applicant, and the starting point is that the conviction should be assumed sound. [4] the merits of this appeal are not so obviously strong as to warrant bail in the interests of justice. it may perhaps be that a mistake was made about the effective sentence, but mr whichman did plead guilty, and he did so after the victim had given evidence at trial. [5] timing considerations are neutral. the sentence of four years expires in june 2020. [6] mr whichman raises other considerations; he wants to break with his gang connections and study at university, and to support his parents financially. rehabilitative and social considerations of this kind are better addressed at a parole hearing, as is the suitability of the proposed address. mr whichman is eligible for parole, though he waived his right to seek it at the last opportunity.

[2] on 16 march 2018, the attorney-general and ipenz's counsel filed a memorandum accepting that costs on a 2b basis but seeking a reduction in dr reay's costs award in the following two respects: the attorney-general v institution of professional engineers new zealand incorporated [2018] nzhc 507 [22 march 2018] (a) $892.00 in relation to a memorandum dated 29 may 2017; and (b) one third to recognise that dr reay was not successful in respect of the privilege element ofthe argument and that a large portion ofthe hearing was spent establishing the existence of legal advice after it was made clear that this was unnecessary. [3] i set out briefly my view as follows: (a) having reviewed the document of 29 may 2017, i do not accept that costs are justified in respect of it. the memorandum was no more than a placeholder. (b) i do not accept that a deduction of one third of the total costs is warranted. it is clear that a successful party is entitled to full costs where the plaintiff succeeded in the essential step of the argument, in this case, waiver. 1 [4] dr reay is accordingly entitled to costs of $12,042.00 and disbursements of $1728. williams j solicitors: crown law, wellington for plaintiff kensington swan, wellington for first defendant buddle findlay, christchurch for second defendant see easton agriculture ltd v manawatu-wanganui regional council [2013] nzca 79 at [ 132].

[4] the applicant has filed an affidavit in support of the application. he annexes a copy ofthe email sending the family comt decision to his solicitors on 20 december 2017, together with a further email exchange of the same day with the family court registry. it appears clear that the delay of almost a month in releasing the decision was due to an administrative oversight. [5] the respondent takes a neutral stand in relation to this application. [6] in those circumstances and given that the application for leave to extend time was filed on 29 january 2017 ( dated 19 january 2018) it appears appropriate the extension should be granted. [7] it was clearly out of the hands of either patty and the cause of the delay for filing the appeal is entirely down to an administrative oversight on the pait of the registry. [8] accordingly, i grant special leave to extend the time prescribed for appealing the judgment of the family court dated 21 november 2017. as the matter was put in the call over list for 5 march 2018 it has taken some time to come before the court. accordingly, the time for appeal is extended to 20 working days from the date of this order. [9] as neither party has contributed in any way to the cause leading to the application i do not propose to make a costs order in relation to t application at this stage. grice j solicitors: mackay & gilkison, wellington for applicant

[1] mr mcguire is appealing a decision of the high court upholding a finding of unsatisfactory conduct made against him by the canterbury westland standards committee. at the time of filing his notice of appeal, mr mcguire also applied for a waiver of the filingfees for both his appeal and an associated application forleaveto adduce further evidence. [2] the registrar declined that application. in doing so, she determined that neither of the conditions foundin reg 5(2)(b) of thecourt of appeal fees regulations 2001(the fees regulations) were satisfied. [3] mrmcguirehas appliedforthat decision to bereviewed by ajudgeof this court. in doingso, hehas asked that thecourt giveconsideration to also waivingthe mcguire v newzealand lawsociety[2018] nzca30 [1 march2018] setting down fee for his appeal. at this stage, it does not appear that any application has been made. an application must be made and a decision given, before mrmcguirecan review it. [4] regulation 5 of the fees regulations provides thataregistrar maywaive afee payable if the applicant is unable to paythefeeor theproceedingconcerns amatterof genuinepublicinterest and is unlikelyto becommenced or continued unless the feeis waived. [5] mrmcguire accepts that the first ground is not available to him. his application is therefore based on a combination of the propositions that his appeal concerns a matter of genuine public interest and is unlikely to be commenced or continued unless the fee is waived. [6] the two requirements are cumulative. mr mcguire has confirmed that, irrespectiveof whether thesefees arewaived, hewill continuewith his appeal. heis, as hehas put itto the registrar, “readyto go”. whetheror not his appeal concerns a matter of genuine public interest, as to which i have considerable reservations, there is no basis upon which the registrar may waive the fees.

' 1­ in the high court of new zealand wellington registry civ-2016-485-514 [2018] nzhc 300 between patrick jeffrey edwards applicant and attorney-general respondent hearing: 24 & 28 february 2017 counsel: e t midlane for applicant r roff and i s auld for respondent judgment: 1 march 2018 judgment of williams j final ruling and orders [1] on 21 february 2018, the attorney-general filed a memorandum advising the parties could not agree final quantum. counsel then set out vanz's proposed approach to assessing quantum which resulted in an award of $366,524.03 plus costs (which were agreed). [2] in a memorandum dated 21 february 2018, mr edwards' counsel advised he disputed three aspects ofthe assessment. in a further memorandum dated 23 february 2018, mr edwards contested the basis of the secretary's s 23 war pensions act 1954 (the act) assessment undertaken in 2000-2001. [3] it is unnecessary for me to rehearse these matters in any detail. instead i set out briefly my view as follows: (a) i do not accept the suggestion that the additional s 23 pension of 10 per cent, granted as from 1 july 1989, should be increased to 60 per cent from the date of s 23 assessment in 2000-2001. this is because: edwards v attorney-general [2018] nzhc 300 [l march 2018] (i) mr edwards was assessed for a s 23 pension in july 2000 and june 2001 and a 10 per cent increase was found to be appropriate in both assessments. vanz holistically assessed his quality of life. i am in no position in an application for judicial review to substitute my view for that ofvanz, even if i agreed with mr edwards' submissions. (ii) in any event, this particular challenge was not raised by mr edwards in his application for judicial review. the focus of the review was on the correct back payment date, not on the s 23 entitlement. i therefore doubt i have jurisdiction to make the adjustment argued for anyway. (iii) vanz's approach has been to apply pension rates in 2017 dollars to the entire period 1966 to 2000. this has a benevolent effect. any issue over the s 23 pension must be considered in the round and balanced against the benefit that mr edwards has derived from vanz adopting 2017 pension rates in its calculations. (b) vanz deducted $25,475.48 to account for the pension already paid to mr edwards over the period of 8 october 1997 to 29 november 2000. vanz was correct to deduct this sum. it was not, as mr edwards seems to misapprehend, a deduction for overpayment. result [4] i am satisfied that the quantum proposed by vanz is appropriate in the circumstances. i make that award accordingly together with costs as agreed. solicitors: legal consultants limited, auckland for applicant crown law, wellington for respondent

[3] the test for recall of civil judgments was described by wild cj in horowhenua county v nash (no 2) as follows:4 generally speaking, a judgment once delivered must stand for better or worse, subject, of course, to appeal. were it otherwise there would be great inconvenience and uncertainty. there are, i think, three categories of cases in which a judgment not perfected may be recalled –— first, where since the hearing there has been an amendment to a relevant statute or regulation or a new judicial decision of relevance and higher authority; secondly, where counsel have failed to direct the court’s attention to a legislative provision or authoritative decision of plain relevance; and thirdly, where for some other very special reason justice requires that the judgment be recalled.

[4] in the judgment dated 20 october 2017 in ca197/2017, leave to appeal under s 296 of the criminal procedure act was granted.2 in the same judgment, the appeal was determined in ms mitchell’s favour. the question of law raised on appeal was answered as follows:3 there is no jurisdiction to impose special release conditions under s 94 of the sentencing act 2002 beyond the time limits imposed by s 93 of that act. accordingly, judge rowe had no jurisdiction to impose special conditions on ms mitchell on 29 july 2016 when the relevant sentence expiry date was 2 december 2015. [5] ms mitchell has now sought to file an appeal arguing there was no jurisdiction to impose special release conditions and that judge rowe had no jurisdiction to impose special conditions. applicationfor review of the registrar’s decision [6] in support of her application to review the registrar’s decision, ms mitchell contends that the judgment of 20 october 2017 dealt only with the issue of leave. in this she is mistaken. the judgment both granted leave, and allowed the appeal. the very issues that ms mitchell now seeks to raise in this new appeal have therefore already been determined. accordingly, the registrar was correct to refuse to accept the appeal for filing on the grounds that the matters ms mitchell seeks to appeal have already been determined in appeal ca197/2017. in short, ms mitchell already has the relief she seeks. to allow her to pursue this new appeal would be a waste of her time and effort, and would moreover, constitute an abuse of process. result [7] accordingly, the application for review of the registrar’s decision to reject the new notice of appeal is declined. 2 at [33]. 3 at [34].

[3] in new zealand venue and event management, the court ofappeal stated the gst position as regards costs and disbursements. disbursements are the same as indemnity costs where the aim is to ensure the successful party is fully reimbursed. whether gst is added will normally depend on whether the successful party is gst registered. ifit is, gst is not added.2 [4] the second respondent (through the crown law office) is gst registered. he rightly requested the registrar to not add gst to the reasonably incurred disbursements. that should have occurred. the registrar is not obliged to order full recovery over the request of the party seeking recovery for a lesser sum. [5] there is nothing in the high court fee regulations 2013 that affects this. if the fee is gst inclusive, a person registered for gst, as here, should seek reimbursement of the fee less gst.

(b) mr jackson’s claim that he needs bail in order to be able to properly prepare for the hearing is without foundation. (c) the prospects of success are weak. the leave application relates to a proposed appeal against conviction and sentence for obtaining a benefit by selling fish without a licence. the conviction followed a guilty plea which of itself creates a significant hurdle. further, the issues mr jackson wants to raise are contrary to settled authority.4 [4] a person seeking suspension of their home detention sentence is required to apply for bail, and thus the application for suspension is treated in a similar way, applying the test relevant to an application for bail.5 [5] the application for suspension of home detention and bail pending appeal is accordingly declined. solicitors: crown law office, wellingtonfor respondent 3 bail act,s14; and harris v r [2013] nzca611, [2014] 2nzlr 438 at [15]–[16]. 4 wells v ministry of primary industries, above n 2. 5 power v auckland society for the prevention of cruelty to animals [2016] nzca 232 at [10]; and din v r [2013] nzca610, [2014] 2nzlr 445.

[2] the prosecution intends to call two witnesses from the bar. one would be a propensity witness. she is an employee who alleges that four days before the incident she was propositioned by mr singh in broadly similar circumstances. the other witness is also an employee who will testify as to the rules surrounding the keeping of a bar diary recording significant events. mr singh, having been made aware the police singh v nz police [2018] nzhc 63 [7 february 2018] were investigating the incident with the complainant, belatedly recorded an entry in the diary. the entry accords with his version of events. the significance of this is in dispute, although it is difficult to see it could have probative value either way. [3] this ruling concerns bail. a condition of mr singh's bail is that he not have contact with these two witnesses. that has the effect of meaning he cannot continue to work at the bar since both women are employed there. mr singh applied for that restriction to be removed. the district court declined. indeed, it strengthened the proposition by acceding to a police application that mr singh be prohibited from entering the bar for any reason (ie as worker or customer). 1 mr singh appeals. [4] on appeal, it is submitted the district court erred in its assessment that there is a risk of interference with witnesses, and failed to have regard to the impact on mr singh's work situation. it seems his work visa is linked to the particular employer. to gain new work he would need to find a new sponsor and obtain a visa variation. [5] the appeal fails. whilst i accept contact with the diary witness is of no significance, it is quite different in relation to the proposed propensity witness. she is an important witness. the risk of pressure coming upon her from a defendant who is the bar manager is obvious and the condition is appropriate. i am also of the view that the prohibition of entering the bar is correct. as the evidence stands in its untested state, two women raise issues about mr singh using the bar manager position for ulterior purposes. one allegation is of a serious sexual assault. a bail condition which minimises the risk of further incidents whilst preserving mr singh's pre-trial liberty is an appropriate balance.

[2] the application for extension is based on a claim that the court has disclosed “their information” to crown law but not to mr newall. this is misconceived. mrnewall is not entitled to discoveryon appeal — he can search the court file as of right —nor should he need further information to comply with the rules. newallvdistrictcourtatmanukau [2018] nzca4[2 february2018] [3] as mr newall is a lay litigant and the proceeding invokes habeas corpus, an extension might ordinarily be granted. but it appears he has brought no fewer than five habeas corpus applications and lacks standing to represent mrs newall. theinterests of justice do not require an extension. [4] the application is dismissed, with the result that the appeal is deemed abandoned because mr newall did not comply with the rules within the time prescribed. [5] for completeness, we have had regard to the document filed by mr newall titled “urgent memorandum/petition to the court for the release of the applicant 29/01/18”. the registrar is not to accept that document for filing. habeas corpus applications must be brought in the high court. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent

[2] the respondent opposes on two grounds: (a) the key issue that determined the appeal was only suggested to the appellant during the appeal hearing. any costs award should be reduced to reflect that on the grounds initially raised by the appellant in relation to the family home, the family court was upheld. (b) the appellant was in receipt of legal aid for the appeal. rule 14.2(f) provides that a costs order should not exceed the actual costs incurred. graham v graham [2017] nzhc 2142. graham v graham (costs) [2018] nzhc 29 [30 january 2018] counsel for the respondent has confirmed that the legal aid costs were $5,142.25. [3] ronald young jin taunoa v attorney-general set out the correct approach in circumstances where the legal aid grant was around half or one-third the costs claimed on a category 2 or 3 basis and where the applicants' success was only partial:2 [43] a resolution of the different views of costs here requires a principled approach. i consider the proper approach here is to identify the proper category and band, calculate the total costs payable on that basis, reduce them by an appropriate percentage, in this case to reflect partial success only, and then compare this figure with the total fees payable to counsel from the legal services board. if the scale fees exceed the legal services payment then r 47(f) [the precursor tor 14.2(f)] applies. [4] even if i were minded to make some reduction for partial success, costs calculated on a 2b basis would be significantly more than the $5,142.25 actually incurred. for that reason i do not need to consider the first point in any detail. rule 14.2(f) plainly caps the costs i can award at $5,142.25. i award costs ofthat sum accordingly. _j~ jt__ ~--­ williams j solicitors: cuba family law, wellington for applicant thomas dewar sziranyi letts, wellington for respondent 2 taunoa v attorney-general (2004) 8 hr.nz 53 (hc).

[3] on 10 august 2016, the court of appeal granted mrs n leave to appeal on specified grounds (none of which concerned my order as to costs), and said:2 c there will be no order for costs on the application for leave given that the respondent’s opposition was reasonable. [4] the court of appeal heard mrs n’s appeal on 31 may 2017. mr n did not appear. the court of appeal allowed the appeal; made a protection order to take effect from the date of the judgment; stated that, if he wished, mr n could apply to the family court for a discharge of the order; and made no order for costs on the appeal.3 the court of appeal’s judgment does not address the issue of costs in the high court. in fact, there is no suggestion on the face of the judgment or from ms mccartney that the issue was raised. the court of appeal did not quash my order as to costs or remit the matter of costs back to the high court. steps in the high court following court of appeal decision [5] by memorandum to the high court dated 31 july 2017, ms mccartney sought costs for mrs n on a 2b basis. 1 sn v mn [2016] nzhc 566, [2016] nzflr 447. 2 sn v mn [2016] nzca384. 3 sn v mn [2017] nzca289, [2017] 3 nzlr448. [6] in response, ms crawshaw submitted that my earlier order remained in effect as it had not been quashed by the court ofappeal and i had no jurisdiction to rescind that order or make any further order as to costs. alternatively, if i considered there was jurisdiction, costs were opposed on the ground, amongst others, that the court of appeal had not seen fit to make any order as to costs in that court, whether on the application for leave or the substantive appeal. [7] i have since received several memoranda from counsel addressing the issue of whether the high court has jurisdiction to reconsider an earlier award of costs if an appeal against the high court judgment succeeds. in the usual course of events the issue does not arise because the court of appeal will quash the high court order as to costs and ask the high court to reconsider the matter of costs. neither occurred in the present case. [8] despite that, ms mccartney has submitted that the “general approach” is that the high court will reconsider an earlier order as to costs if its judgment on the merits is overturned.4 ms mccartney also referred me to several authorities in support of a submission that the court “commonly reconsiders costs” in the event of a successful appeal to the court ofappeal.5 discussion [9] i have considered the authorities to which ms mccartney has referred me but i do not consider that i have jurisdiction to make the further order that mrs n seeks.6 although high court rules, r 14.8(2) permits the court to revisit costs that it has previously ordered on an interlocutory application, there is no equivalent provision in respect of costs ordered following judgment. none of the authorities to which i was referred is directly relevant to the situation that arises in the present case. 4 memorandumofcounsel forthe appellant dated27october2017at [8]. 5 at [2]; and ac beck and others mcgechan on procedure (looseleaf ed, thomson reuters) at [hrpt14.17(11)]. 6 haronga v waitangi tribunal [2011] nzca 670, (2011) 20 prnz 855; lsg sky chefs new zealand ltd v pacific flight catering ltd [2015] nzhc 685; wholesale distributors ltd v songle supermarket ltd [2015] nzhc 809; americhip, inc v dean [costs] [2015] nzhc 1871, (2015) 22 prnz 703; and murrell v hamilton [2014]nzca377, (2014) 3 nztr 24-012. haronga v waitangi tribunal [10] in haronga v waitangi tribunal, the court of appeal dismissed mrharonga’s appeal but made no order as to costs.7 the supreme court then allowed mr haronga’s appeal, awarded him costs in the supreme court and ordered the court of appeal and high court to fix costs in those courts.8 i accept ms mccartney’s submission that the court of appeal subsequently awarded costs to mr haronga as if it had allowed his appeal. however, the important point for present purposes is that the supreme court had remitted the issue of costs back to the court of appeal which had, in any event,madeno earlier order as tocosts. these matters distinguish the case from the present. lsg sky chefs new zealand ltd v pacific flight catering ltd [11] likewise, in lsg sky chefs new zealand ltd v pacific flight catering ltd. in the first instance the high court awarded costs to lsg as the successful party.9 [12] the court of appeal allowed pacific’s appeal against the high court judgment on the merits, awarded costs on the appeal to pacific, quashed the high court order as to costs and directed the high court to re-determine costs in accordance with the court ofappeal’s judgment, which the high court did.10 wholesale distributors ltd v songle supermarket ltd [13] the case closest to the present is wholesale distributors ltd v songle supermarket ltd, but in that case the high court was reconsidering costs awarded on an interlocutory application, as to which the (then) high court rules, r 14.8(2) applied.11 7 haronga jnr v waitangi tribunal [2010]nzca201. 8 haronga v waitangi tribunal [2011] nzsc 53, [2012]2 nzlr 53 at [152]. 9 lsg sky chefs new zealand ltd v pacific flight catering ltd [2012] nzhc 2810 at [73]. 10 pacific flight catering ltd v lsg sky chefs new zealand ltd [2013] nzca 386, [2014] 2 nzlr 1 at [42] and [43]; and lsg sky chefs new zealand ltd v pacific flight catering ltd, above n 6. the supreme court’s subsequent dismissal of lsg’s appeal did not affect the matters referred to above. see lsg sky chefs new zealand ltd v pacific flight catering ltd [2014] nzsc 158, [2016]1 nzlr 433. 11 wholesale distributors ltd v songle supermarket ltd, above n 6. [14] in that case, moore j had declined wdl’s application for an interim injunction and awarded costs against wdl.12 although the court of appeal allowed wdl’s appeal and awarded wdl costs on the appeal, it did not quash the high court order as to costs nor remit the matter of costs on the application back to the high court.13 moore j had jurisdiction to revisit his earlier order and to make a fresh order in favour ofwdlunder r 14.8(2) which provides: 14.8 costs on interlocutory applications (1) costs on an opposed interlocutory application, unless there are special reasons to the contrary,— (a) must be fixed in accordance with these rules when the application is determined; and (b) become payable when they are fixed. (2) despite subclause (1), the court may reverse, discharge, or vary an order for costs on an interlocutory application if satisfied subsequently that the original order should not have been made. (3) this rule does not apply to an application for summary judgment. [15] as i have said, there is no equivalent provision to r 14.8(2) in respect of costs awarded after judgment. americhip, inc v dean [16] ms mccartneyalso referred me to americhip, inc v dean. in that case ellis j had dismissedamerichip’s proceeding on the ground the court had no jurisdiction to 14 hear and determine the claim. ellis j awarded costs to mr dean. [17] the court of appeal allowed americhip’s appeal, ordered mr dean to pay costs in the court of appeal and quashed ellis j’s order as to costs.15 other than that, however, the court of appeal made no order regarding costs in the high court, although it did remit the case back to the high court to determine a separate issue. 12 wholesale distributors ltd v songle supermarket ltd [2014] nzhc 2548 at [85]. 13 wholesale distributors ltd v songle supermarket ltd [2014] nzca565, (2014) 16 nzcpr 14 at [38]. 14 americhip inc v dean [2014]nzhc 450 at [73]. 15 americhip inc v dean [2014]nzca380, [2014] nzar 1137 at [26].

[2] the determination reserved costs but encouraged the parties to resolve that issue themselves. it included an indication that, if asked to determine costs, the authority’s assessment would be the notional daily tariff of $4500. [3] in a memorandum on costs subsequently lodged by mr wate, through his representative, he sought an order for a costs award of $22,526.40. no evidence, such as invoices, was provided in support of this claim. upon review it was apparent the costs sought were, in effect, indemnity costs and included various disbursements, such as travel expenses, and costs associated with mediation. [7] the starting point of any costs assessment is the notional daily tariff of $4500. mr wate has provided no evidence in support of his claim for an uplift in this amount. i accept talbot’s submission that it is very difficult to properly assess mr wate’s claim for disbursements in the absence of such evidence. [8] what is clear, however, is that as a general rule costs are not available for attending mediation.1 costs may be available where the conduct of one party falls into the category of “aggravated” circumstances2 or where there has been a serious breach of good faith by a party directed to mediation under s 152(2) of the employment relations act. neither was the situation here. result [9] taking into account all relevant circumstances, the sum of $4500 must be paid to mr wate within 28 days of the date of this determination. andrew dallas member of the employment relations authority 1 trotter v telecom new zealand limited [1993] 2 ernz 935, 937 and naturex limited v rogers [2011] nzempc 9 at [16]. 2 real cool v gunfield [2009] nzempc 127 at [3]

[2] you are 28 years old and employed as a factory worker for a local milk company. in november 2016 you arrived in new zealand from cambodia. you completed a declaration and declared some matters but no entry was made regarding the declaration of fish or animal skins. the customs officials at the airport found [the] concealment of fish wrapped in plastic wrap inside the parcel of the squid that had been declared. it found fish products also including fish guts and one contained the concealment of two animal skins. you were spoken to and said that you had concealed the fish and animal skins because you knew that they were not allowed into new zealand. [3] these products are banned from new zealand and they are banned for good reason. it is to effectively manage pests and unwanted organisms and if they come into new zealand there is a grave risk that our massive primary industry could be jeopardised by such pests and organisms coming into the country. that is why the offence that you face has a maximum prison sentence of five years and/or a fine of $100,000. [4] mr wright is has seen you as the duty solicitor. i am most assisted by ms priest who has not only spoken to me orally - these matters not usually being dealt with by a court in this location - but has provided comprehensive and written submissions. she is to be complimented on the quality of the submissions that have been made. she is clear that a starting point for you in respect of this matter is a fine of somewhere between five to $6,000 and/or a community work order. community work is a problem for you given the hours that you work at the factory. i am told that you have a family that you are supporting. i am told that you have $1,000 of savings that you can make available to pay a fine. [5] all courts have guidance from appellant courts about having assessed an amount of a fine and here the prosecution is on strong ground - then having to consider an amendment of it to take into account that a fine would be paid over a reasonable period of time. a fine at that level at $50 per week if that could be occasioned would take a significant amount of time. i take into account your guilty plea to the matter and i intend to reflect a reduction in the fine to some extent to take into account your personal circumstances and ability to pay. given all of that, i now mr sdeong having convicted you fine you the sum of $3,000 and that is to be paid at the initial instalment of $1,000 and then at the rate of $50 per week. ________________ judge nd cocurullo district court judge date of authentication: 19/12/2017 in an electronic form, authenticated pursuant to rule 2.2(2)(b) criminal procedure rules 2012.

[3] we accept the crown’s submission that this case falls within the second category of exceptional circumstances in r v le page2 and watts v r3 so as to permit a successful conviction appeal following a plea of guilty. that is where a miscarriage of justice arises because, on the admitted facts, the appellant could not in law have been convicted of the offence charged. consequently, notwithstanding the guilty plea, we allow mr mcintyre’s appeal against his conviction on the charge of accessory after the fact to murder. result [4] the appeal is allowed.

[3] mr romanov says there are issues with the way his pre-sentence detention has been calculated. if that is so, then the correct procedure for him to follow is the appeal mechanism ins 92(4) of the sentencing act 2002. as matters currently stand, mr romanov is serving a sentence of imprisonment imposed upon him following a conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction. as his current parole eligibility date is currently calculated to be 10 september 2018, his application for a writ of habeas corpus must be dismissed. fj6il= 2:> db collins j solicitors: crown law office, wellington for first and second respondents

[4] on 6 september 2017 ms nicolette levy was appointed as counsel to assist with identifying whether there were any grounds to advance his application, to prepare submissions in respect of that application as he required and to provide such other assistance as he requires. [5] ms levy has filed a memorandum in which she reports she met with mrtuirirangi on 8 september 2017 and discussed a wide range of matters relating to mrtuirirangi’s conviction, sentence, mental health and parole. some of the observations he made during that meeting were inconsistent with wishing to continue his application for a second appeal and overall his ability to understand the complex issues was limited. he was nevertheless willing to speak with her. [6] following the meeting she sent a letter providing further advice and a noticeof abandonment of appeal if mrtuirirangi’s decision was that he did not wish to continue with the appeal. when she next visited mr tuirirangi he did not wish to speak with her, but using a prison guard as an intermediary she established that he had received her letter, thrown it out, that he could not remember having a live appeal, that he was not interested in it anyway because he did not have a lawyer and his sentence was nearly up. [2] in that minute mr tuirirangi was advised that unless he filed submissions in support of his application for leave to bring a second appeal by 24 november 2017, his application for leave to appeal would be struck out for non-compliance with timetabling orders. [3] mr tuirirangi has not filed any submissions and is in continuing breach of timetable orders. [4] pursuant to s 338 of the criminal procedure act 2011, this court has power to dismiss an application for leave to appeal for non-compliance with timetable orders. that is the appropriate step to be taken here. given mr tuirirangi’s failure to comply with the timetable orders to date, it seems clear he does not wish to proceed with his application. the application for leave to bring a second appeal is therefore dismissed. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent

[2] i have a letter from presbyterian support acknowledging the assistance they have given you but asking me to take into account that they simply cannot continue to subsidise your life on a daily basis. [3] you are 74 years of age. you have no previous convictions. there is no entitlement to funding from the new zealand government in any form. you have recently had a serious stroke. you have other serious health problems and in particular that includes heart problems, and i see that you are taking medication for what i assume is for angina. you are of no fixed abode, save that which is provided for you. it could be said that you are at low risk of re-offending but as mr taylor has said in his report that ignores the long period of living under what is a stolen identity. you have been served with a deportation order. you will be deported upon completion of any sentence. [4] i accept it is very serious offending to steal and use another person’s identity and to do so for a considerable period of time is a significant aggravating factor. you did not stop until you were confronted with the truth and understood that others knew. conditions of release are not sought and a short sentence of imprisonment seems to be the only option. i accept that imprisonment is required to mark the seriousness of the offending and as deterrence to reflect the ease with which you seem to have been able to take advantage of your wrongdoing over a long period of time but because of the extraordinary circumstances set out in miss burnside’s submissions, i accept a realistic approach is called for. i adopt a starting point of six months. i allow a reduction for plea and good character at one-third, giving me an end result of four months’ imprisonment. that is not to be seen as indicative of the tariff or anything else. i have no real advantage from submissions as to starting point. it is merely a merciful response to reflect the extraordinary circumstances which are now before me. [5] on each, you are convicted. you are sentenced to imprisonment for four months. leave to apply for substitution of sentence is declined. the conditions of release imposed by statute and on statutory release date, reparation is declined as there is no realistic prospect of payment. fines of $1,040 are remitted forthwith. j e maze district court judge

[2] the application was initially opposed with a notice of opposition by eight affected owners. however, seven of the eight now consent to the application. the eighth owners, mr and mrs singh, have taken no step beyond the notice of opposition. and, this morning i granted leave for their counsel, who also acted for the seven other affected parties, to withdraw; mr jiang had no instructions. [3] i am satisfied the application should be granted. the covenant was first registered in 1996. auckland has changed—and grown significantly—since then. so too the area the subject of the application, with which i am familiar. i am satisfied the covenant ought to be modified because of a change since the covenant’s creation to the character of the neighbourhood: what was once largely rural land is now very much a residential part ofauckland city. [4] an application of this nature may require reasonable compensation to be paid. the evidence filed in support of the application satisfies me there will be no significant deleterious effects if the covenant is modified as proposed. consequently, i order land covenant d083110.1 is modified so it no longer applies to an estate in fee simple, lot 1, deposited plan 178443 as comprised in unique identifier na105b/641. …………………………….. downs j

[4] the applicant’s defence to the claim for fees and his counterclaim against the respondent has been the subject of detailed consideration in both the high court and the court of appeal. all of the points the applicant wishes to raise are essentially relitigation of matters decided in the courts below and are specific to the facts of the case. no point of general or public importance arises. the material before the court does not give any reason to consider that a miscarriage of justice might arise if leave is not given. in those circumstances we dismiss the application for leave to appeal.

[3] in our view, the case turns on its facts, or to put it another way it raises no serious question of law. in essence, the applicants complain that the employment court discounted evidence tending to show that the company was the employer. the court correctly directed itself that it must consider the real nature of the relationship and it focused on the objective indicia.2 the findings that it made were plainly available to it. [4] in any event, the applicants face two further difficulties which appear to render the proposed appeal moot. the first is if they contracted as agents they did so without disclosing the principal. it is no answer to this that they did disclose what the court found was their own trading name. the second is that s 25(2) of the companies act 1993 applies, meaning they are personally liable unless that would not be just and equitable. the applicants were personally responsible for the respondent’s dismissal. all that might be said in their favour is that they did not intend to deceive by failing to disclose the company’s name. [5] the application for leave to appeal is dismissed. as the applicants are legally aided, we make no order as to costs. solicitors: raineycollins,wellington for respondent at [41]–[46].

[3] on 31 october, senior corrections officer mcbrearty filed an affidavit advising that at the time he was asked to take the call: mr warren became very disruptive and ran around the unit, delivering cds and other items to other prisoners. he was directed to get on the call with the court. warren v the chief executive of the department of corrections [2017] nzhc 2832 [17 november 2017] then, he ran to the upper landing of the unit, and continued to deliver items to other prisoners. he was abusive towards staff. he was given a final direction to get on the call with the court, but continued to be abusive and disruptive. rather than implement a control and restraint procedure either to force mr warren to take the court's call or to stop conducting himself in an abusive and difficult way, the decision was instead made to re-lock him in his cell (for his own safety and that of staff). [4] in my minute of 30 october, i gave mr warren until the end of the following day to file written submissions. he did not meet that deadline but on 16 november, he filed written submissions essentially challenging the legitimacy of the current legal order and therefore his incarceration; and suggesting he is not the person in whose name he is incarcerated. [5] i am satisfied that this application for a writ of habeas corpus must be dismissed. the warrant pursuant to which mr warren is detained is valid. he is serving a sentence of preventive detention, a sentence handed down by brewer jon 11 august 2017. [6] crown counsel refers to authorities both with respect to mr warren's claimed dual personality, and with respect to the challenge to jurisdiction. without needing to refer to any of them, i find that neither argument has any prospect of success.

in the district court at north shore cri-2016-044-001730 [2017] nzdc 25619 ministry of health prosecutor v shearwater hotels limited defendant hearing: 10 november 2017 appearances: j wilson for the prosecutor j quinn for the defendant judgment: 10 november 2017 notes of judge p j sinclair on sentencing [1] shearwater hotels limited appears for sentence in relation to three charges of failing to take all reasonably practicable steps to ensure that no person smokes in a part of a licensed premises that is not an open area. those offences have a maximum penalty of a $4000 fine. [2] this matter has a protracted history. on 7 december last year, shearwater hotels limited was found guilty after a judge alone trial on four charges laid under the same sections; ss 12, 17, 17a smoke-free environments act 1990. [3] on 20 january, i sentenced shearwater to combined fines of $2700 on all charges along with court costs of $130. i also imposed solicitor costs of $850. the reasons for my guilty findings and sentencing are contained in written decisions dated 7 december and 20 january respectively. [4] shearwater appealed the convictions and on 13 march this year the high court allowed the appeal in particular in relation to an interpretation of “internal area” under the act, and quashed the convictions. the charges were referred back to this court to determine whether the beachfront lane and anzac road areas were, in fact, internal areas. since then, on 5 september, shearwater has pleaded guilty and admitted three of the charges (one charge has been withdrawn). so the matter is remanded to today for sentence. [5] mr quinn, representing shearwater hotels, has advised that he cannot pursue the matter any further as he has “run out of funds”. he urges the court to impose a nominal fine in view of the history of this matter. the crown submit that i re-impose or re-instate the fines i imposed in january of this year, taking into account there is one less charge to address. [6] in my view, there is no need for me to traverse the facts or matters i took into account for sentencing. a copy of an amended summary of facts can be annexed to this decision. [7] mr quinn has pleaded guilty to the charges on the basis of the lengthy summary of facts i have referred to. in my view, mr quinn is entitled to a discount for the guilty pleas he has entered. it has obviated the need for a further trial. although, as the crown has submitted, this particular situation has not been contemplated by r v hessell1 and therefore i cannot draw on the factors specifically referred to in that decision, in my view shearwater hotels is entitled to a discount of around 15 percent. [8] on that basis, taking into account there is one less charge, i impose a fine of $1650 across the three charges plus court costs of $130 and solicitor’s costs of $850. 1 r v hessell [2009] nzca 450, [2010] 2 nzlr 298 p j sinclair district court judge

[4] i intend to deal with the matter today because delaying it any further is not good for you. it is affecting your mental health. it is affecting the stability of the complainant as well. today i will impose the term of imprisonment of 12 months but i will grant you leave to apply for home detention there. i impose also post-release conditions for a period of six months after your release date directing that you are to: (a) complete an alcohol or drug assessment and any alcohol or any treatment recommended including residential treatment that might be seen as necessary. (b) to complete any treatment with a departmental psychologist as directed by your probation officer and to the satisfaction of your probation officer.

[2] mr dvorak died on or about 26 september 2017. the nature of his application was personal to him. section 47 of the care of children act 2004 provides that certain people may take the place of a parent who has died for the purposes of determining who may have contact with the child. however, we are satisfied that this provision is applicable to a fresh application for a parenting order, not to an appeal, and in any event no party or legal representative has identified an interest in or asserted a right to continue the proceeding in this court. [3] this court’s rules do not prescribe how to determine an application for leave to appeal, or to extend time, in the event of the applicant’s death. however, under r 5(4) of the court ofappeal (civil) rules 2005, if any matter arises in a proceeding for which no form of procedure is prescribed, this court must dispose of the application in the manner which is best calculated to promote the ends of justice. [4] because we have not assessed the merits, we are not in a position to positively decline the applications. however, mr dvorak was not represented by counsel and we are satisfied in the circumstances that no other party will seek leave to pursue these applications and the proposed appeal on his behalf. in our judgment the ends of justice would be best promoted by deeming both of his applications abandoned. there will be no order for costs. solicitors: o’sullivan clemens, rotorua for respondent dvorak v yamamoto [2017]nzhc 1591.

[3] my primary hesitation in granting leave is whether w's situation will fall within the test, however interpreted. on its face, it would represent the tenuous end of a causation spectrum. however, the applicant's approach would accommodate it, and accordingly i have determined a grant of special leave is appropriate. [4] leave will be given on the first two proposed questions. i do not consider the third question, which purports to identify a burden of proof issue in relation to whether the evidence shows w to have made a claim in or around 1979, is seriously arguable. nor does it involve a question of law. rather, it is a challenge to the court's determination on the evidence. [5] leave to appeal is given on the following questions (which overlap): 1. what is the proper ambit and meaning of the words "because of' in s 26( 1 )( c) of the accident compensation act 2001? 11. was her honour correct to hold that a "direct" causal link between the physical injury and mental injury was required to satisfy s 26(1)(c) of the accident compensation act 2001 (mental injury suffered because ofphysical injury). [6] once the appeal is filed, the parties should organise a fixture ( one and a half days?) and then submit a consent memorandum concerning timetabling. simon france j

[2] pursuant to cl 17.l(b) of the trust deed, by deed of nomination of an appointer dated 1 october 2012, mrs brennan's son, john alan brennan (john brennan) was appointed to exercise his mother's powers as appointor in her place at any time that her powers were deemed to be suspended. as mrs brennan has become incapable of acting as a trustee, john brennan gave notice to his mother and the applicant that his mother's powers as appointor were suspended and she was removed as a trustee ofthe trust. [3] the applicant acknowledges that john brennan has validly given notice removing his mother, mrs brennan, as a trustee of the trust and seeks an order vesting the trust's property situated at 4 school road, plimmerton, porirua in the applicant, to give effect to the removal of mrs brennan as a trustee. [4] importantly, the children of mrs brennan, namely john brennan, sally anne alvey and jennifer maree brennan, who are the final beneficiaries of the trust, have consented to this application.

[2] also the defendant’s attire at the commencement of the trial when he was dressed in prison clothing with the letters mecf stencilled on the back of his top. and on that basis mr clearwater is submitting he will not receive a fair trial. that application is premature and declined. [3] in terms of the evidence of the coffee table, as indicated in my minute of yesterday, that can be dealt with squarely by a formal warning to the jury to put it to one side now and also when i sum up. [4] as far as the reference to jail, that can be treated in the same manner. the concerns about the defendant’s attire were addressed by me earlier on in the trial yesterday and i am simply not satisfied that that alone even in combination with the other matters, would be grounds to take the dramatic step of discharging the jury at this point and recommencing the trial. [5] i am, however concerned that there is no further repetition by the complainant or any further witnesses in this trial of evidence being given that is clearly prejudicial to the defendant and has not been agreed to be led. on that basis i will allow the crown an opportunity to meet with the complainant to ensure there is no repetition when she resumes giving her evidence today. e p paul district court judge

[3] there are two proposed grounds of appeal. the first is that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and the second that the primary direction by the trial judge as to inferences was in respect of another defendant. the same arguments were advanced to the court ofappeal.3 [4] in dealing with whether the jury’s verdict was unreasonable, the court of appeal applied orthodox principles.4 its application of those principles is challenged primarily in respect of the result. no point of general or public importance arises and we see no indication of a miscarriage of justice. [5] the challenge as to the absence of an inference direction specific to the applicant was dismissed by the court of appeal on the basis that there was no need for the trial judge to repeat the direction which he had already given in respect of the other defendant.5 again no question of general or public importance is raised and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.

[3] the application for recall is misconceived and the material relied on in support of it beside the point. the court of appeal held that the contents of the report are for the department to determine and in particular that it “was open to the department to view the information [in question] … as not relevant to the board’s task”.3 this is the same approach as we took, save that we personalised the process by treating the principal case manager as the departmental decision-maker. this personalisation was immaterial to the outcome of the application for leave to appeal. this is because the question which the applicant wished to raise on appeal (namely that the department was required to include his contribution) did not depend on the identity of the person who decided that it should not be included. to the extent that the applicant’s complaint is that the department was not entitled to exclude his contribution, this is just a re-run of the argument already addressed in the leave judgment. [4] accordingly, the application for recall is dismissed. solicitors: sellar bone and partners,auckland forapplicant crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent gilmour v chief executive of the department of corrections [2017] nzca 250 (harrison, winkelmannandasher jj).

[3] if leave to appeal were granted, the applicant would contend that the reekie principles require adaptation in the present case because: (a) it involves an appeal challenging a bankruptcy order; (b) the commissioner is the prosecutor in the criminal proceedings and the practical effect of the bankruptcy will be to require the applicant to defend those charges on legal aid and thus without the practical ability to choose his counsel; and (c) there are outstanding issues between the applicant and the commissioner in other proceedings. he also would argue that the willingness of counsel to appear for him on appeal warrants dispensation with securityfor costs.

[2] the respondents took no steps to pursue the issue of costs pending mr gilmour's appeal to the court of appeal. that appeal was dismissed on 14 june 2017. 1 mr gilmour's application for leave to appeal to the supreme court was dismissed earlier this week.2 gilmour v chiefexecutive ofthe department ofcorrections [2017] nzca250. gilmour v chiefexecutive ofthe department ofcorrections [2017] nzsc 133. gilmour v chief executive of the department of corrections [2017] nzhc 2165 [7 september 2017] [3] the respondent has quantified its 2b costs in accordance with the high court rules. mr gilmour disputes the quantum of the costs claimed, not because the relevant steps were not taken by the respondent but because he says a lesser amount should, for various reasons, be payable in relation to some of those steps. there has been an exchange of memoranda. [4] as the respondent says, however, the whole point of the costs regime under the rules is predictability and expedition. the court should not often be troubled by arguments about costs. none of these objects is achieved if the parties are permitted to take nice points about whether or not the time allocated by the rules for taking a particular step should be adjusted. [5] the short point is that once the skill and experience level appropriate to the particular proceeding has been determined (as it has here) the relevant band determines what is regarded as a reasonable amount of time for each step. it is rare that costs calculated according to scale will equate to or exceed a party's actual costs and r 14.2(±) prevents recovery of more than the costs actually incurred. [6] in my view, none of the matters raised on mr gilmour's behalf warrants departing from a costs award determined in accordance with the rules. i therefore make an order that the costs and disbursements payable by mr gilmour are as set out in the schedule to the respondent's memorandum dated 2 august 2017, namely $24,665.10.

[2] the plaintiffs now accept the quantum claimed by the second defendants under 2b of $25,791.00 plus $110.00 for disbursements. [3] the plaintiffs however submit that there should be no uplift in costs as sought by the second defendants and further that there should be a reduction in costs as the second defendants sought to introduce extraneous and unnecessary evidence into the proceeding. [4] while the plaintiffs failed in their applications for judicial review increased costs are not justified. it cannot be said the proceeding was entirely without merit and should never have been brought. i accept the general criticism of the plaintiffs’ pleadings in that there were numerous particulars under each cause of action but the argument was more focused. i also accept that both parties were guilty of adducing evidence which was not directly related to the issues in the proceeding. on balance this is not a case for increased costs. result/orders [5] the plaintiffs are to pay the first defendant auckland council costs in the sum of $24,417.00 (including disbursements).

[2] the respondent, mr rewita, was found guilty of supplying or being in possession of supply of 221.2 grams of methamphetamine. he was selling this in one or two ounce lots for approximately $12,500 per ounce. the parties agree that during the relevant period of criminal activity mr rewita unlawfully benefited to the value of $97,500. this equates to 7.8 ounces at $12,500 per ounce. for that reason the parties agree that the maximum recoverable amount is $97,500. [3] the total value of assets currently under restraint is $85,000. this comprises cash, motor vehicles, motorcycles and motorcycle parts that were seized during the course of the police investigation. the parties have agreed that all of the restrained property is to be disposed of under s 83(1) of the act with the exception of a 1987 harley davidson motorcycle registration number 14wab (having a value of $12,000) and assorted motorcycle parts that were seized from an address in tokoroa on 12 june 2015. the value of those items is unknown. the motorcycle and motorcycle parts are to be returned to mr rewita once the court has approved the settlement. [4] i am satisfied that the orders that the parties seek are consistent with the purposes of the act because they return much of the profit derived by mr rewita to the crown. the commissioner has agreed not to pursue mr rewita for the difference between the maximum recoverable amount and the total value of the forfeited property. this reflects the fact that litigation inevitably carries with it risk and expense that can be avoided if the parties reach agreement regarding the orders to be made.

[2] both lole and iese are children of mr and mrs paleae senior. they are kristina and ann’s siblings. both are new zealand citizens, and ms woodroffe advises that she has been instructed that neither has anycredit issues that could affect lending to the trust. both are in employment and copies of letters confirming that have been made available.

[4] in the court of appeal, the applicant’s main argument was that the original trespass notice in the dunedin incident was invalid because no unlawful act preceded it. this aspect had been addressed by mander j and the court of appeal saw no error in the approach taken or any matter of public or general importance in the circumstances requiring a second appeal.4 in this court, the focus of mr brown’s written submissions is on concerns he has about the way in which his complaints have been dealt with in other cases.5 [5] under s 213(3) of the criminal procedure act 2011, the judgment of the court of appeal dismissing the application for leave to appeal is “final”, which precludes an appeal to this court from that decision.6 nor would we be prepared to grant leave for a leap-frog appeal (that is, direct from the high court judgments) given that there are no exceptional circumstances in this case that would justify such an appeal, as is required. in these circumstances there is no need to have an oral hearing of this application as mr brown sought.

[2] the appellant company is in liquidation, but the proceeding is not brought by the liquidators in their own names. they have chosen rather to bring the proceeding in the name of the company. the deputy registrar’s reason for refusing the application for waiver was that liquidators should be personally liable for the payment of fees. he accepted that the appellant does not have readily available assets. h investments ltd (in liquidation) vofficialassignee [2017] nzca353[16august 2017] [3] the application for review is brought on the ground that the liquidators should not be required to fund the filing fee, so incurring a liability for a debt of the company. the liquidators say that it is in the best interest of the creditors to challenge the decision of the official assignee that is the subject of the judgment under appeal. the liquidators believe they have a claim against the company’s director. the director is bankrupt, and the official assignee rejected the liquidators’ claim. in the high court associatejudge sargisson dismissed an application foran order that theassignee be required to accept the liquidators’ proof of debt.1 [4] i accept that the deputy registrar was wrong insofar as he reasoned that the liquidators are personally liable to pay filing fees. theyare liable where proceedings are brought in their own names, but not where proceedings are brought in the name of the company in liquidation. this court has accepted in the past that companies mayapplyfor a waiver of a filing fee.2 [5] however, it does not follow that a waiver ought to be granted where the company is in liquidation, even if the company has no readily available assets with which to pay. the liquidators do have the option of paying the fee themselves, in which case the payment will form part of their expenses in the liquidation, or asking the creditors of the company to fund the payment. there is no reason why the state should effectively subsidise resolution of this dispute by waiving filing fees.

[2] the summary of facts has been accepted. you were part of a group of a number of people to whom you are related who on 14 january this year collected some 3024 cockles from a beach at potts road in whitford. those cockles were then placed in four white plastic paint containers in the boot of a vehicle, that vehicle being a subaru vehicle, registration number [number deleted]. it is accepted by the ministry for primary industries that neither of you was motivated by any commercial intent. in other words this was gathering for a family purpose. nevertheless the amount that was gathered was obviously greatly in excess of the daily entitlement per person which is of course 50. [3] ms priest for the ministry has addressed me in relation to the provisions of the fisheries act and you will have heard her go through the very good reasons as to why these provisions are in place, to protect the cockle beds for all citizens and for future citizens. the question here in terms of sentence is simply what level of fine should be imposed. [4] mr mellin has submitted on your behalf that rather than (inaudible: 10:46:34) a fine is the most appropriate outcome. i have been provided with a schedule of fines imposed in similar cases. i accept the starting point for each of you as being a fine of $1000. from that you are entitled to a discount for your guilty plea and of course a discount for your prior good characters. i accept that you have no convictions for similar offending in the past. taking those two facts into account i think the appropriate end point is a fine of $600 each in addition to $130 court costs each. the fine is to be paid at the rate of $20 per week commencing from next week. [5] the second issue that arises is the issue of forfeiture of the vehicle. an order for forfeiture is made for the vehicle pursuant to the provisions of the fisheries act s 255c(2)(c). ms priest has quite properly advised me that the ministry will not stand in the way of possession being retained of the vehicle (inaudible: 10:47:47) needs to occur and they will not oppose an application for relief against forfeiture by the owner of the vehicle whom i understand to be a third party who was not involved in your offending. r j mcilraith district court judge

[2] rule 401 jury rules 1990 provides that every jury list provided by the electoral commission to the chief executive of the ministryof justice under s 10 of the act must include particulars including occupation. [3] the difficulty is that a fair proportion of electors do not disclose their occupation on the electoral roll and therefore the information contained in our jury lists is not complete. r vdouglas john harvey[2017] nzdc 17536[7august 2017] [4] this issue has been raised already by mrwhite of the public defence service in other trials. he apparently managed to persuade both [judges] to direct the registry to make enquiries of those persons in the panel whose occupation was not stated, to disclose their occupation, that information was then handwritten into the list and disclosed to counsel. [5] i expect that, as in the present case, those were applications made on the day. i have not had time to properly research the matter. there is a panel waiting but it seemstomethat nowherein this application isthereanybasisforthecourt to exercise the power beingsought. whetherthe registryispreparedto go theextrastep and make enquiries in relation to jurors’ occupations is a matter for the registry. [6] i do not see that i have any power to intervene in the matter or compel those enquiries to be made particularly where resources are as thinly stretched in the court as theypresentlyare, essentiallyto breakingpoint. i am not going to make adecision placing any further burden on the staff without a solid statutory basis to do so. [7] the principal basis for making this application is that there may be people on the jury list whose occupations are not stated who fall within a prohibited class of jurors, lawyers, judges, communitymagistrates, j.p.’s and soon. it isdifficult to see in practice how that might be the case but i suppose, potentially, there is a remote possibility that that could occur. [8] defence counsel may challenge jurors for cause on the basis that they fall within a prohibited class. if counsel wishes to make a challenge of that kind i have indicated i would simply ask the juror to step to the bench, enquire whether their occupation falls within the prohibited class and if it does not they would then take a seat on the juryunless they were otherwise challenged, but that would not involve me disclosing the juror’s occupation in open court to counsel. d j mcnaughton district court judge

[3] media works has now filed a memorandum in respect of costs. rather reluctantly, it accepts my suggestion, although it repeats its view that the appeal lowes v media works tv limited [2017] nzhc 1130. lowes v media works tv limited [2017) nzhc 1729 [25 july 2017) should have been avoided given media works' standards committee acknowledged the inaccuracy in the broadcast in relation to mr lowes' initial complaint on 26 august 2016. [4] media works also notes it has tried to limit mr lowes' potential cost exposure throughout the proceeding and did not instruct counsel to appear on its behalf. it does, however, seek as a disbursement the cost of in-house counsel's travel from auckland to wellington and return. these costs total $606.79. [5] mr lowes has filed a memorandum in response, submitting mediaworks should bear "a share of the costs" and repeating his criticism of the inaccuracies of the broadcast. he also contends mr turton, in-house counsel at mediaworks, went to media works' wellington office that day "to update their employees, so he was on company business that day". [6] costs are at the discretion of the court. i acknowledge media works' reservations as to the way in which mr lowes has conducted himself in these proceedings but nevertheless consider the decision not to pursue costs is an appropriate one in the circumstances. that is not to say this is the approach which will always be taken by the court if inaccuracies are acknowledged and rectified at an early date. [7] i do, however, consider it appropriate to award media works the costs of its disbursements. it was successful in the appeal and i accept it minimised its costs by using in-house counsel to appear. it should not, however, be out of pocket and it is awarded the disbursements of $606.79. they are reasonable and reasonably necessary for the proceedings.

[2] mr szeleky now seeks areview of the registrar’s decision. szekelyv north [2017] nzca295[11 july2017] [3] in support of his application for review, mr szekely relies on an affidavit sworn by a mr corke. however, the affidavit concerns mr corke’s own dealings with the respondents and his adverse view of the respondents. it is irrelevant for present purposes. [4] the second argument advanced by mr szekely is that he is in debt as a result of this litigation and it is the respondents who are to blame for that state of affairs because they have seriously misled the court. [5] i accept, as did the registrar, that mr szekely has a large amount of debt comprised mainly of legal fees and costs arising out of this litigation. whether the respondents have seriously misled the court is, however, for another day. it cannot be determined at this stage. what matters at this stage as regards filing fees is that although mr szekely has debt, he also has a not insignificant income. i am satisfied he is able to pay the filing fees. [6] i note too that mr szekely has stated he will continue with the proceeding regardless of the outcome regarding payment of filing fees. [7] finally i am satisfied the appeal does not concern a matter of genuine public interest within the meaning of reg 5(4) of the court of appeal fees regulations 2001.

[3] mr rabson has also filed what purports to be “an application for review” under s 28(2) of the supreme court act 2003.4 [4] the background to this application need only be briefly summarised. essentially, mr rabson took issue with the intituling used by the registrar in the reference line in a letter relating to the application for leave. mr rabson objected. the matter was referred to a judge. ellen france j directed the registrar he should allow the applicant to use the intituling he sought to use (which reflected that used in the court of appeal judgment in this matter).5 mr rabson was advised of this direction. further correspondence between mr rabson and the registrar followed. then, on 11 may2017, mr rabson filed the application for review referred to above. the application sought a copy of the judge’s ruling “overturning the registrar’s refusal to properly name the proposed respondents”. [5] assuming for these purposes that a review was available under s 28(2), it is apparent from this summary that the application of 11 may is an abuse of process. the initial action of the registrar was inconsequential. mr rabson was advised of the judge’s direction. moreover, the outcomewas exactlyas mr rabson had sought. the application for review is dismissed.

[3] the plaintiff also says the legal costs were incuned by muse on allen ltd, which is now in liquidation, and not by the norths personally. i accept the plaintiff is correct that these costs may not be claimed. relief had been claimed against the company, but it subsequently went into liquidation. the liquidators did not consent to the litigation and relief was not pursued. [4] however samuel north incuned disbursements of $687.53 (inclusive of gst) in the preparation of documents for the hearing. he also incurred disbursements of $7,143.38 (inclusive of gst) in expert fees. the plaintiff is ordered to pay these two sums totalling $7,830.91.

[2] the court has taken the view that leave applications are required to be dealt with by permanent judges of the court.4 four of the five permanent judges of the court are second respondents to the appeal. the doctrine of necessity thus applied. the court was well aware that the aspect of the minute which the applicant wished to challenge was the order for costs. but, for the purposes of the leave decision, what was primarily important was the decision of the court ofappeal judge.

[2] mr van moeseke has financial needs which are compounded by his health difficulties. these needs and his health difficulties are set out in the affidavits that have been filed. the basis on which an order under the family protection act 1955 is sought is the failure of the deceased to make, out of the abundance of his resources, a provision sufficient for the proper maintenance of mr van moeseke. van moeseke v andrews [2017] nzhc 1385 [22 june 2017] [3] all relevant paiiies have reached an agreement pursuant to which two of the deceased's prope1iies are to be transfened to mr van moeseke. in addition he is to receive a fmiher provision of $1,040,000 from the estate (inclusive of an interim payment of $500,000 already made). this agreement means that two charities will receive less than that provided under the deceased's will. they consent to this. [4] i am satisfied that it is appropriate to make provision for mr van moeseke out of the deceased's estate pursuant to s 4 of the family protection act 1955. accordingly the draft order provided with the joint memorandum of counsel dated 8 june 2017 may be sealed. \jua j mallon j

[3] in question is whether the preferential dividends continued to accrue until conversion. this question was answered in the affirmative in the high court by courtney j1 and her decision was upheld in the court of appeal.2 [4] the case turns on the interpretation of a resolution of the shareholders of 2 september 2002 and a short form prospectus. while it is the case that in the high court, courtney j referred to a general presumption that preference share dividends accrue cumulatively,3 this consideration did not feature in the reasoning of the court of appeal. the issue involved is thus very particular and, contrary to the submissions of counsel for the applicant, there is no question of public or general importance or commercial significance involved. it was not contended that the miscarriage of justice ground is engaged and in any event we see no appearance of an error of the kind which might warrant the grant of leave on this ground.

[2] the respondent seeks costs on a 2b basis, which she calculates at $9,366 together with disbursements of $200. mr ashmore, for the appellant, does not quarrel with the calculation of costs. he does, however, invite me to reduce the costs on the basis that, although the appellant was ultimately successful, there were errors in the original judgment that led to my granting leave to appeal. i am not satisfied that this fact does justify a reduction in the costs in this case. it is evident from the issues raised in argument and the extent of information provided to me that this appeal put both parties to considerable cost. the errors in the judge’s original decision were not serious errors, even though i considered they justified a re­assessment of the position. but overall, there is no basis for reducing the costs that would normally follow the outcome.

[4] i agree with the prosecution that the starting point for someone who is at the low end of criminal culpability by being what we describe as a mule or a courier, for that quantity and purity of drugs sits around 12 years’ imprisonment. r vevelin de fatimastemposki[2017] nzdc 12765[15 june 2017] [5] thecourt has the benefit of previous cases by way of comparison and by way of setting what the appropriate sentencing limit is provided by both the prosecution and defence, and it is by applying those previous cases as precedent authorities that i get to a start point of 12 years imprisonment. [6] because you are going to be serving time in prison, you are at a disadvantage compared to local people in asimilarsituation. that disadvantage stems from the fact that your familyis stillinbrazil, your friends arethere, you do not speak thelanguage here and of course we have different moral standards that you will have to adjust to. so foryou toserveatermof imprisonment is morearduous than itmight befor others. [7] itakethose things into account togetherwith the fact that you havenoprevious convictions either here or overseas it seems. [8] because your guilty plea occurred at an early stage, iam also able to give you a 25 percent discount from the starting point in relation to those. [9] so, taking one year off because of no previous and because of difficulties that you will have serving your term of imprisonment, and then further reducing the start pointby25 percent and rounding itdown to the least number i can possiblyimpose, i end up with an end sentence of eight years’ imprisonment. [10] i impose that on both charges concurrently; and the drugs are to be destroyed. no mpi is imposed. judge ga andrée wiltens district court judge date of authentication: 16 june 2017 in an electronic form, authenticated pursuant to rule 2.2(2)(b) criminal procedure rules 2012.
in the supreme court of new zealand [201 sc 44/2017 7] nzsc 85 between michael john denney applicant and the queen respondent court: elias cj, glazebrook and ellen france jj counsel: j f pereira forapplicant a j ewing for respondent judgment: 9 june 2017 judgment of the court the application for leave to appeal is dismissed. reasons [1] the applicant was convicted after trial of intentionally causing grievous bodily harm by using his vehicle to run over the complainant, mr blain. the applicant appealed unsuccessfully against conviction and sentence to the court of appeal.1 he seeks leave to appeal to this court against conviction. [2] the background is as follows. after an argument with mr blain at a party, the applicant left in his car. others at the party watched while mr blain chased after the applicant’s car on foot before disappearing out of sight. mr blain was found some minutes later lying on the road with serious injuries. [3] against this background, there are three proposed grounds of appeal. the first ground is a challenge to the reasonableness of the verdict. the second proposed denney v r [2017] nzca80 (winkelmann,woodhouse and collinsjj) [denney (ca)]. michaeljohn denneyv r [2017] nzsc 85 [9 june 2017] ground concerns the directions of the trial judge, judge bergseng, in relation to evidence of a statement made by the applicant to the arresting officer which the court of appeal found was admissible under s 30 of the evidence act 2006.2 the final ground also concerns the judge’s directions to the jury, in particular, as to expert evidence relating to tyre track measurements at the scene. [4] none of the three proposed grounds of appeal raise questions of general or public importance. rather, all three grounds are specific to the particular circumstances of this case. [5] nor is there a risk of a miscarriage of justice. in relation to the first proposed ground, the court of appeal was satisfied looking at all of the evidence that the jury’s verdict was reasonable. there is no appearance of miscarriage arising from that assessment. in terms of the other two proposed grounds, the court of appeal considered the directions given were sufficient. there is nothing in the material before this court to call in doubt that conclusion. [6] the criteria for leave are accordingly not met. the application for leave is dismissed. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent. judge bouchier in r v denney [2015] nzdc 8062 at [74] ruled the evidence was not improperly obtained. the court of appeal held that ruling was incorrect but that the evidence was nonetheless admissible under s 30(2)(b) of the evidence act 2006: denney (ca), above n 1, at [23]–[37].

[4] with regard to the proposed appeal against associate judge osborne’s decision he said: the second part of the application for leave to the supreme court relates to the ‘leap frog’ appeal from the decision of the high court (29 november 2016 judgment). in my view the judge adopts an orthodox approach to determining the issues before him (based very much on the specific facts of the case) and consequently again no question of law that is of significant interest to the public or to a substantial section of the public will need to be determined by the supreme court on appeal. again i am not satisfied that the appeal from the high court concerns a matter of genuine public interest in terms of r5(2)(b)(i) [of the supreme court fees regulations 2003]. i also note that french j at para [15] of the 21 march 2017 judgment expresses the same view in respect of the appeal from the high court to the court of appeal. [5] the matters ms harrison seeks to raise relate to her own particular circumstances. i agree with the registrar’s assessment that they do not meet the threshold for a fee waiver under r5(2)(b)(i) of the supreme court fees regulations 2003. [6] the application for review is dismissed.

[3] we agree with the crown’s submission that mr rowell has not met the criteria for a pre-trial appeal.4 mr rowell may raise the issue in any later appeal should he be convicted.

[3] the difficulty has arisen because under r 53d of the court of appeal (civil) rules 2005 scale costs are calculated in accordance with the time allocations in sch 2 and sch 2 only mentions appeals and applications for leave to appeal. further, r 53c — which regulates the daily recoveryrate — onlyrefers to appeals. [4] however, the established practice is that the appropriate daily recovery rate for a “standard application” is the same as for a standard appeal. as regards the time allocation, costs “as for a standard application on a band a basis” are calculated by analogy on the same basis as applications for leave under sch2. our order was made in accordance with that established practice.

[3] the applicant’s argument that the evidence was unfairly obtained essentially failed on the facts in the district court. the court of appeal in declining leave to appeal saw no reason to reconsider those factual findings. the court also declined leave to adduce new evidence from a linguistic expert as to the applicant’s command of english.3 that was because the court was not satisfied the district court judge could have reached a different opinion if the proposed evidence was before that court.4 [4] under s 213(3) of the criminal procedure act 2011, the judgment of the court of appeal dismissing the application for leave to appeal is “final”, which precludes an appeal to this court from that decision.5 nor would we be prepared to grant leave for a leap-frog appeal (that is, an appeal directly from the district court judgment) given the non-satisfaction of the criteria for a leap-frog appeal.

[2] the court has discretion under r 14.7(g) to refuse to award costs or reduce the costs otherwise payable if "some other reason exists which justifies the court refusing costs or reducing costs". i have not been referred to any case where this the minister of education & ors v mccartney & anor [2017] nzhc 1093 [24 may 2017] rule has been relied on in a situation similar to mr mccartney's, but i think it premature to discount that possibility at this interlocutory stage. [3] rule 14.8 provides that "costs on an opposed interlocutory application, unless there are special reasons to the contrary" must be fixed when the application is determined, and become payable when fixed. in my view, there are special reasons justifying delay. mr mccartney is, as i have said, also a victim in this situation. i consider that the best time to assess the relevance of that fact to the issue of costs will be after the substantive hearing and the decision on the merits. [4] costs are reserved accordingly. solicitors: morgan coakle, auckland for plaintiffs wellesley chambers, napier for defendants

(b) if the first question is answered in the affirmative, should the high court have remitted the case back to the environment court for reconsideration? [2] in addition to seeking leave on the two questions where we have granted leave, the applicant also sought leave to appeal on the procedural question of whether the environment court should have put the parties on notice of its proposed approach to pt 2, so that they could reframe their submissions accordingly. it was argued that the high court did not determine this issue. [3] we decline leave to appeal in respect of this procedural question as it is not of general or public importance. the broad issues were fully canvassed in the environment court, and in the high court there were detailed submissions given on all matters relied on in the environment court decision. therefore, on an overview, there has been no procedural unfairness. moreover, as counsel for the applicant accepted, leave being granted in respect of the primary questions above means that the applicant will have another opportunity to put forward all submissions on pt 2 that it considers to be relevant. solicitors: russell mcveagh, auckland for applicant cooper rapley, palmerston north for respondent ironside law, nelson for interested parties

[2] the application is suppo1ied by an affidavit of one of the committee members, ms loveridge, which provides important information in support of the application. [3] the committee manages the tariki hall (the hall) and has done so for many years. the committee considers their founding document is the trust deed dated 17 april 1911. all the original trustees are deceased and no new trustees have been appointed. the certificate of title for the land on which the hall sits remains in the names ofthe original trustees. fabish [2017] nzhc 1045 [22 may 2017] [4] the committee carries out administrative business regarding the hall and regularly meets to discuss the use, servicing and financing of the hall. i note the committee now finds itself in a difficult position, given the expenses required to maintain the hall exceed the income the committee has managed to generate. the committee has resolved that a sale of the hall would be in its best interests. it has also resolved to donate the sale proceeds to charity and then wind up the committee (and presumably also the trust). [5] it is not possible to take any of these steps until the trust has active trustees. [6] this court has the power to appoint new trustees when it is expedient to do so, even where there is no existing trustee. 1 [7] i am satisfied from the evidence that it is expedient to appoint new trustees to the trust. i am also satisfied it is impracticable to do so without the assistance of the court, having referred to the appointment provision of the trust deed and the absence of current trustees. in all the circumstances it is appropriate the new trustees are all of the members of the committee, being those who have for a number of years managed the hall. in doing so they have effectively acted in accordance with the terms of the trust. [8] the trustees will need to consider the te1ms of the trust and their powers before taking steps to dispose of the hall. [9] for the reasons given, the application is granted. accordingly, i order: paul william fabish, denise may loveridge, thomas rupert loveridge, andrew kelvin mcelroy, dorothy michelle oakes, tania maree simpson, cindy lee baldwin and kevin ronald bennett are appointed as trustees of the tariki hall trust. thomas j solicitors: gavett quilliam, new plymouth for applicants trustee act 1956, s 51(1).

[2] on appeal to the court of appeal the applicant’s primary complaint, as the court understood it, was that he had been the victim of a conspiracy encompassing greer v r [2016]nzca630 (asher,woodhouse and ellisjj). alan ivo greer v r [2017] nzsc 75[16 may2017] the police, the prosecutors and the courts to deny him justice.2 faced with this, the court appointed counsel to assist who identified two points which he considered to be worthy of argument.3 these were considered by the court of appeal and dismissed.4 counsel was not able to identify a credible basis upon which the sentence could be challenged.5 the court nonetheless reviewed the grounds upon which the sentence of preventive detention and minimum period of imprisonment had been imposed and, on the basis of this review, dismissed the appeal.6 [3] the grounds of appeal primarily identified by the applicant in his application for leave to appeal are variations on the conspiracy theme identified by the court of appeal. he also, however, complains about the participation of wild j in directions hearings in respect of his appeal to the court ofappeal (and in particular in requiring him to file a particularised grounds of appeal)7 and what he says has been a pattern of non-disclosure and failure to provide him the facilities he required to present his case. [4] thecomplaints about wild j and the directions hegavearemisconceived and beside the point. theapplicant did notcomplywith the directions. it was in light of this that the court appointed counsel to assist. the court of appeal provided the applicant a fair opportunity to present his case which he did not take up. it is clear from the court of appeal judgment that counsel appointed to assist addressed, as best he could, the merits of the applicant’s general complaints. nothing that is of relevance to the present application came out of that exercise.

[2] the document is an unsigned will that was drafted on the deceased's instructions some six years before her death. at that time mrs uruamo, and her husband arthur, visited a local law firm asking that wills be drafted. there were no prior wills. [3] the wills were drafted and sent to the couple for approval and execution. mr uruamo deposes that neither of them realised the wills actually had to be signed, and believed that they were being provided with copies of valid wills. mr uruamo says they never read the lawyer's letter properly. consistent with this, at the time of his wife's death his will also remained unsigned. mr uruamo deposes that over the years his wife repeatedly expressed satisfaction she had taken care of him in her will. a similar sentiment was expressed when mrs uruamo was in hospital prior to her death. estate of uruamo [2017] nzhc 931 [10 may 2017] [4] the only issue here is the length of time that has elapsed since the wills were provided. care is needed that the lengthy period does not reflect a change in heart rather than the inadvertence or a misunderstanding. in re gray (dec 'd), a will that was unsigned for nine years was validated. 1 the circumstances were different, but it provides an example where a lengthy lapse of time has not prevented the validation of the document. in re cornelius (dec 'd), the period was three years.2 that appears to have been a situation where the testator just never got around to signing the will. again the unsigned will was validated. [5] the ultimate inquiry is whether the court is satisfied the document proffered expresses, at the time of the person's death, their existing testamentary intentions. i am satisfied that is the case here. the document is a draft will that expressed the intentions of the testator at the time it was drafted. there is nothing to suggest those intentions ever changed, nor is there evidence of any relevant change in circumstance that might have prompted mrs uruamo to take a different view. the couple have three children who have all consented to the application. [6] i declare that the undated and unsigned draft will prepared for mrs uruamo in december 2010, and appended to the present application, is the valid will of mrs whetumarama ote haahi ratana uruamo. simon france j re gray (dec'd) [2014] nzhc 1082. re cornelius (dec'd) [2012] nzhc 563.

[2] the recall application is misconceived. mr rabson has issued proceedings against the members of this court and has made numerous complaints to the judicial conduct commissioner about the way they have dealt with applications which he has made. the members of the court against whom these actions have been taken have no alternative but to address his applications. moreover, as the court said in its earlier decision, mr rabson’s submissions about the alleged strength of his appeal rabson v judicial conduct commissioner [2017] nzsc39. malcolm edward rabson v judicialconductcommissioner [2017] nzsc 66[9 may2017] are not directed to the “exceptional circumstances” test which must be met before leave can be granted for a leapfrog appeal.

[2] in particular the starting position is that costs must be fixed when an interlocutory application is determined unless there are special reasons to the contrary.2 the novelty of the legal point on which the strike out application was durie v gardiner [2017] nzhc 377. high court rules 2016, r 14.8(1). durie v gardiner [2017] nzhc 897 [5 may ~01,7] based is not in itself a special reason not to fix costs.3 the fact that the defence will be tested at trial is accounted for in the rules.4 [3] the general principle is that the party who fails with respect to an interlocutory application should pay costs to the paiiy who succeeded.5 the defendants were the successful party. neither defence, the subject of the application, was struck out. the defendants were required to re-plead the defence, but the plaintiffs failed on the more fundamental issues of whether the defamatory meanings were capable of being understood as expressions of opinion and whether there was any prospect of the defendants establishing reasonable grounds for believing the opinions were genuine. therefore, although the plaintiffs had a measure of success in that the defendants were required to re-plead this defence, i am not satisfied that the pleading problems significantly increased the costs ofthe plaintiffs.6 [4] the defendants seek costs on a 2b basis and disbursements as calculated in their schedule (total $20,381.54). the plaintiffs have not challenged the items claimed or their calculation if costs are to be ordered. i make an order for the costs ( and disbursements as claimed. ;l)~l / mallon j couch v attorney-general [2010] nzsc 27, [2010] 3 nzlr 149 at [180] and shell todd oil services ltd v nazzer hc new plymouth cn-2005-443-268, 31 october 2005 at [17]. 4 high court rules 2016, r 14.8(2). 5 rule 14.2. 6 rule 14.7(d).

[3] the court of appeal did, in fact, express its view as to the scope of the reservation of leave. the leave judgment provided what this court regarded as a plausible explanation for the structure of the original orders. and, as the judgment makes clear, the court was satisfied that the applicant could not credibly maintain that he had suffered a miscarriage of justice; this irrespective of the approach taken to the extent of the reservation of leave.

[2] the last paragraph of the judgment, paragraph [24] of the judgment reads: the respondent is entitled to costs, to be calculated on a 2b basis. if the parties cannot agree costs, i will receive submissions limited to five pages, exchanged in advance. [3] that was a finding, and remains a finding, that the respondent is entitled to costs to be calculated on a 2b basis. the court has received submissions where both parties are under the misapprehension that they were entitled to argue whether or not the respondent is entitled to costs and if so, on what basis. [4] the respondent has calculated costs on a category 2b basis totalling 6.3 days at $2,230 per day, the sum of $14,049. counsel for the unsuccessful appellant has calculated costs on a category 2 basis, but with a mixture of category a and category b arriving at 5.2 days. [5] my judgment was for all attendances on a category 2b basis. i have compared the identification of steps. i agree that the respondent should not get costs on sealing an order. so i recalculate costs at 6.1 x $2,230=$13,603. [6] accordingly, the costs awarded are as calculated by the respondent’s counsel in the sum of $13,603. [7] this judgment has been delayed because of the submissions received from the parties having been mislaid in the registry. nonetheless, the award for costs carries interest under the judicature act from the date of this judgment. marginson v bhana [2016] nzhc 2835.

[2] at 27 years of age mr [hammond] already has four previous convictions for violent behaviour toward the same complainant. they are in a relationship, there are [number deleted] children who have all been taken into care and it appears that the underlying cause of the violence is mr [hammond]’s synthetic cannabis addiction. [3] in total he has been involved in 41 domestic violence occurrences, obviously many of them not resulting in proceedings, but 16 of those have been in the last 12 new zealand police v [oscar hammond] [2017] nzdc 7951 [13 april 2017] months so there is an escalation in his offending and pressure may well be building toward a point where there is a very serious outcome. [4] this is reflected in the summary of facts for both these charges. the summary in relation to the first matter, the assault with intent to injure containing a number of particularly ugly components, it was a prolonged and calculated attack on the complainant and alone it calls for a starting point of 18 months’ imprisonment. [5] the second matter was not in that category, but would require an uplift of six months’imprisonment and the previous history to which i have referred an uplift of three months’imprisonment. the end result will be a starting point of two years and three months’ imprisonment from which some discount is appropriate, for the eventual guilty pleas, although they were not the earliest guilty pleas. mr [hammond]’s perception of matters may well have been affected by his drug addiction until such time as the beneficial effects of a remand in custody began to work through. i would reduce the sentence by three months, and accordingly on the assault with intent to injure impose a sentence of two years’ imprisonment and a concurrent of six months’ imprisonment for male assaults female, one month for breach of supervision, one month for breach of bail, all concurrent, an effective sentence of two years’ imprisonment. a j adeane district court judge

[3] this case raises the issue of whether there is a right of appeal against the imposition of release conditions in short duration sentences. in my recent decision in patterson v r, i found that there is such a right.6 the crown now says that case was wrongly decided, and ms mitchell has no right of appeal. it is common ground that the issue is moot in this particular case either because as a result of the decision of the supreme court in marino v chief executive of the department of corrections7, judge rowe did not have jurisdiction to impose conditions at all, or, if he had jurisdiction (the crown suggests that marino may only have prospective effect) the conditions have long since expired anyway. both parties in this case nonetheless want the question resolved, because, they say, it is in the public interest to have a clear answer. in any event, whether that is enough to overcome the mootness issue is not for me. that is because this court is not the appropriate forum to address the issues raised by this appeal. if there is jurisdiction it is the court of appeal, not the high court that is the correct first appeal court.8 the crown has indicated that it would not oppose an extension of time for filing an appeal in the court of appeal. [4] accordingly, the appeal is dismissed due to lack of jurisdiction. the appellant is invited to re-file in the court of appeal. 6 patterson v r [2017] nzhc 49. 7 marino v chief executive of the department of corrections [2016] nzsc 127, [2017] 1 nzlr 223. 8 criminal procedure act s 247. williams j solicitors: crown law, wellington for respondent

[2] the police officer who witnessed the offending and stopped the applicant was a detective who was not in uniform. basing himself on ss 113 and 114(1) of the land transport act 1998, the applicant maintains that the detective had not been entitled to stop him. as the high court and court of appeal judgments point out, 1 silby v new zealand police [2016] nzca592 (cooper, brewer and petersjj) [silby (ca)]. 2 silby v new zealand police [2016] nzhc 162 (venningj) [silby (hc)]. 3 new zealand police v silby [2016] nzdc 25869(judge becroft). david keith silbyv newzealandpolice [2017] nzsc46 [7april2017] this argument overlooks s 114(2) which authorised the course the detective took.4 there is thus no substance in his complaints. [3] under s 213(3) of the criminal procedure act 2011, the judgment of the court of appeal dismissing the application for leave to appeal is “final” which precludes an appeal to this court from that decision. we are not prepared to grant leave for a leap-frog appeal (that is direct from the high court judgment) given its lack of substance and the non-satisfaction of the criteria in s 14 of the supreme court act 2003.5 [4] accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent 4 silby (ca), above n 1, at [15]–[20]; and silby (hc), above n 2, at [16]–[22]. 5 this provision applies to this application despite the repeal of that act: senior courts act 2016, sch5 cl 10.

[4] the general point that mr rabson wishes to argue is that cull j was wrong to strike out the proceedings because the commissioner had not considered the merits of his complaints, so that it was not possible for cull j to reach a view about them. in relation to the exceptional circumstances required to justify a “leap frog” appeal,6 mr rabson relies on his inability to pay security of costs in the court of appeal, as well as the importance of the matters he seeks to raise.

[4] two, there is nothing formally known by way of prior convictions and so to that extent this lady comes to the court, ms murray, with good character, blemished now by obviouslythis achilles heel that has taken its toll of her good character as we speak but up until now in her stage in life she has been living trouble-free.

[2] mr kohler qc appeared in support of the applications today. there was no appearance for the respondent. the case has some history. as i have observed, the proceeding was filed on 14 october 2016. there was an attempt at settlement, i assume on the basis ms muir would re-finance. that has not occurred. [3] mr kohler advises ms muir returned a key (for the property) to his clients at the weekend, presumably on the basis she would take no further step to resist the proceeding. no notice of opposition has been filed. when the proceeding was last called before davison j, his honour adjourned it on the basis that adjournment was to be the last. and so it has proved to be. i am satisfied theapplications are proper: (a) the lease(c460128.2f) is cancelled as of 11april 2017. (b) thetieus are to have possession of thepropertyfrom the same date. (c) they are also entitled to rent in arrears. as at 28 february 2017, the outstanding amount was $266,930. the daily rate of rent is $315.06. i make an order the tieus are entitled to outstanding rent of $266,930, plus the daily rate of $315.06 through to and including 11april 2017.

[2] your offending falls within what is known as band 4. the crown submitted that the appropriate starting point was between 15 and 16 years’ imprisonment. your counsel argued for a lower starting point of 12 years. at the sentencing indication hearing i indicated i would take a starting point of 14 years. i confirm that starting point and that is the starting point i take today. [3] since the sentencing indication i have received the pre-sentence report. you told the probation officer that you decided to engage in this offending knowing the risks as the pay off was worth it. the report writer observed that you have displayed little remorse. [4] mr kan has submitted today that you are remorseful, and says that a sentence of imprisonment will be a harsh one for you, given that you are in new zealand where you have no family or other support at all. [5] i confirm that you will be given a full 25 percent for your guilty plea which will reduce the sentence to one of 10 and a half years’ imprisonment. but there will be no further discount. [6] i indicated at the sentencing indication hearing that there would be no minimum period of imprisonment greater than that which applies under the parole act 2002. i will not depart from that indication but i do record that i seriously question whether i was right to adopt that position. [7] those who come to new zealand for the purpose of importing methamphetamine must expect lengthy terms of imprisonment. methamphetamine is an absolute scourge in our society. i consider that the general public have no idea of the extent to which it is prevalent. it wrecks lives, and there is little room for compassion or leniency for those who would distribute it. so i consider that you are fortunate that there is no minimum period of imprisonment greater than that which applies by statute. [8] therefore the sentence is one of 10 years six months’ imprisonment. r j collins district court judge

[3] on an application for a direct appeal to this court from the high court, an applicant must meet the usual test for leave3 and establish as well that there are “exceptional circumstances” which justify a direct appeal.4 we are satisfied that neither test is met in this case. [4] first, this proposed appeal raises no question of general or public importance. rather, it concerns the application of settled principles in relation to strike outs to the particular circumstances of this case. mr rabson has raised nothing which suggests that dobson j may have erred in his application of the relevant principles or that there is arisk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. [5] second, no exceptional circumstances have been identified which justify a direct appeal to this court. the matters raised by mr rabson on this point appear to go to the strength of his proposed appeal. but that is not a sufficient reason for a direct appeal. [6] the application for leave to appeal is dismissed. the applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent. solicitors: meredithconnell,wellingtonfor respondent 3 supreme court act 2003,s13(nowreplacedbythe seniorcourtsact 2016,s74). 4 supreme court act,s14(nows75ofthe seniorcourtsact).

[3] i have now received submissions on behalf of mr simpson seeking either that both parties are reimbursed for their costs from the trust fund or costs should lie where they fall. no submissions have been filed by or on behalf of ms sax. [4] in the circumstances, where there has been the opportunity to file submissions but ms sax has chosen not to do so, i will proceed to deal with the question of costs. [5] i accept mr simpson’s submission that his application was required given the impasse between the trustees as to whether the district court proceedings should be defended or not. [6] i also concur with the submission that mr simpson’s application can be considered brought in good faith given my observation that there appeared to be a reasonably arguable case in respect of both positions. [7] mr simpson was not, however, successful on his beddoe application. i take note of the matters put forward on mr simpson’s behalf alleging that ms sax’s conduct had contributed unnecessarily to the time the case has taken. there is some merit in those observations. [8] i accept this is a case where both parties have had a measure of success and in the circumstances it is appropriate that costs lie where they fall. thomas j solicitors: holland beckett, tauranga for plaintiff/second defendant families matter law practice, rotorua for first defendant

[2] mr paino earlier sought a sentence indication on behalf of mr workman and i gave such an indication which was subject to a pre-sentence report being obtained, a home detention sentence together with disqualification and reparation, with the home detention likely to be in the nine to 10 months’ range, together with counselling and treatment as set out in the psychological assessment the court had earlier sought. new zealand police v wiremu hamilton workman [2017] nzdc 6335 [24 march 2017] [3] that indication was accepted but has been overtaken by the new charges. it is now accepted that the sentence of imprisonment greater than that which would otherwise have allowed a community-based, electronically monitored sentence to result is inevitable. [4] there was some discussion between counsel and me today as to how that should be calculated but in the end, given that mr workman will be appearing before the parole board in due course. to ensure no complications arise from the cumulative sentences being imposed in respect to different groups of sentence, mr workman is dealt with in this way: (a) on the offering to supply methamphetamine, he is convicted and sentenced to two and a half years’ imprisonment. (b) on each of the unlawful taking and receiving charges, and the three firearms’ charges, he is convicted and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment. (c) on each of the three charges of driving whilst disqualified, he is convicted and sentenced to three months’imprisonment, together with one year’s disqualification from 24 march 2017, that is today. (d) on the single charge of breach of bail, he is convicted and discharged. [5] having imposed those sentences as all to be served concurrently, as indicated mr workman will in due course appear before the parole board. it will be up to him to demonstrate at that time that he has taken advantage of any and all rehabilitative options made available to him during his sentence. a i m tompkins district court judge

[2] you went to her motel room which was where she was working, but i agree with the crown’s submission that this was akin to a private dwelling because her own personal items were there. you, over a series of texts, organised to go there. she thought you were a paying client. [3] and when you got there, by your conduct, you attempted to check out whether any of your property was at the address and once howarth arrived in possession of a weapon, you involved yourself by punching her to the head. r v tracey lee bell [2017] nzdc 5626 [17 march 2017] [4] the effect on her has been significant. her vehicle was taken and her phone, although the vehicle has been returned. i accept the crown’s submission that this was a joint enterprise between you and was marked by clear planning and preparation. [5] in the sentencing of mr howarth, judge marshall identified an appropriate starting point of four years and nine months. the crown here submits that you are equally culpable. a distinguishing point really is that you have no relevant previous convictions but that is not a factor which goes to starting point. [6] the violence that you engaged in is perhaps at a lower level and the degree of your participation can be recognised relative to that of howarth’s in setting a slightly lower or a lower starting point. i set that as a term of four years. [7] you have prior good character that you can call on and i give you a credit and there are also the circumstances of a jail term impacting more sternly on you as someone who has never been there before and currently you are being held in segregation for unknown reasons. i give you a credit of six months for those characteristics. [8] the end sentence therefore, is one of three years and six months. d m wilson qc district court judge

[2] the testator had a friend prepare his will. the friend and the testator were seemingly unaware of the requirement for two witnesses in the presence of each other. the document contemplated one witness, and that is what occurred. [3] the document begins: this is the last will and testament of ian robert jameson of …. i hereby revoke all other wills and testaments. the contents are orthodox leaving all his estate to his wife. if she predeceases, then to his children in nominated shares. [4] the witness has sworn an affidavit. it was she who drafted the will on mr jameson’s instructions. he confirmed to her it represented his wishes. she saw him sign it and herself then immediately witnessed the will. [5] the applicant is mr jameson’s surviving spouse. her only two children have both consented to the application. [6] there is no doubt the document represents mr jameson’s intended will. although it is improperly witnessed, the circumstances show there was a witness present who saw him sign, and who is in a position to confirm it was her expressed intention. there is nothing unusual about the contents that might cause one to hesitate, or inquire further. [7] i declare the document dated “14 day of 9 2013”, and headed as described in para [3] above to the valid will of mr ian robert jameson. _____________________________ simon france j

[2] the driving while forbidden i am not concerned about, i convict you and discharge you in relation to that but that second set of offending occurred while you were on bail awaiting sentence for the first set of offending. r v papa william [2017] nzdc 4925 [9 march 2017] [3] the sentence indication that i gave you was that the appropriate start point for the second set of offending was two and a half years plus the earlier offending and i would take into account your youth, you have no previous convictions and your pleas and i would get down to something like 26 months taking into account everything. the change since then is firstly that i have been corrected as to your actual age at the time of the earlier offending which is not as significant as the second offending and a pre-sentence report which has been obtained. [4] the pre-sentence report is not flattering, a description of you being smug and amused when relaying the circumstances of your offending and it records that you showed no remorse for your actions and as the sergeant says, to be driving around in a motor vehicle in the process of having possession of methamphetamine for the purposes of supply with a loaded modified weapon, a pistol, is a very serious matter. [5] i am prepared to take into account the new material and new information that i have today but what that enables me to do is to reduce the starting point down to 24 months’ imprisonment. [6] i then have to consider whether home detention is available for you and whether it is appropriate, it is obviously available because the law provides for an alternative to serving 24 months’ imprisonment by means of serving a sentence of home detention. the issue is does that satisfactorily deal with holding you accountable for your conduct and to deter you and others from acting in this way in the future? i am not satisfied it does, so even though you are in the range for a sentence of home detention i accept the recommendation in the pre-sentence report and sentence you to an actual term of imprisonment of 24 months, i impose that on the possession of methamphetamine for supply. [7] the driving while forbidden, as i say, is convicted and discharged. [8] on all the other charges, three months’ imprisonment concurrently. g a andrée wiltens district court judge

[2] the new material that i have before me since then is a memorandum by your counsel ms maxwell which repeats the indication that i gave. it indicates that you are remorseful and that you have some insight now into your offending and some intent to change your ways. ms maxwell on your behalf, and ms cherrington this morning repeats that, seeks a small further reduction from the starting point indicated. i regret that that is not possible. [3] i gave you a discount of 25 percent for your pleas which were not at the earliest possible stage, they were still relatively early but 25 percent is for the maximum available. not only that, i am going to cancel the sentence of community r v christina ngatokoroa glassie [2017] nzdc 4920 [9 march 2017] work and remit the outstanding fines of $3850.68. that seems to me to take into account your letter of remorse that you have now written at a very late stage in the proceedings, and your stated intentions to change your way of life. [4] the end sentence needs to remain at the level of three years six months’ imprisonment. i impose that for the robbery and the aggravated robbery charges. for all the other charges three months’ imprisonment, all sentences to run concurrently. [5] once you have served your sentence the parole board will look at appropriate release conditions. g a andrée wiltens district court judge

[2] prior to charges being laid, enforcement officers made 13 visits to the site. the applicants say that after the second of the visits it must have been apparent that offences were being committed and that, from that point, there was no longer power to carry out inspections under s 332. rather, a search warrant under s 334 should have been sought. [3] this argument was fully addressed in the district court by judge thompson and in the court of appeal.1 both judge thompson and the court of appeal concluded that on all occasions, the primary purpose of the visits was to monitor compliance and that they were accordingly within the scope of s 332(1). this finding of fact does not appear to be specifically challenged by the applicants and if it were, such challenge would not warrant the grant of leave to appeal. in light of the finding of fact, we see no arguable basis for the contention that the inspections were unlawful. [4] accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed. for fair trial reasons we make an order prohibiting publication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in news media or on the internet or other publically available database until final disposition of trial. publication in law report or law digest permitted. solicitors: treadwell gordon, wanganui for applicants crown law office, wellington for respondent r v fugle dc palmerston north cri-2014-054-3231, 18 april 2016 (judge thompson); and fugle v r [2016] nzca 619 (miller, winkelmann and asher jj).

[3] we reject the application for these reasons: king v r [2015] nzca506. kingv r [2017] nzca46[7 march 2017] (a) mr king has failed to show a fundamental error in procedure in this court’s determination of his appeal or that a substantial miscarriage of justice would result if there was. our decision to refuse mr king’s application for an adjournment took into account all relevant factors including our satisfaction that he had abused the court’s processes by engineering a situation where he remained unrepresented and certain medical records were unavailable. in any event, we were satisfied that none of mr king’s grounds of appeal against his conviction or sentencewere arguable. (b) as this court emphasised in r v smith, the power to recall is not be exercised where an applicant has an effective remedy reasonably available.2 mr king is aware of his rights to appeal to the supremecourt.3 in a minute issued on 16 december 2016, the supreme court referred to documents filed by mr king in its registry between august and november, and his later application to the registrar to withdraw his scheduling of “a non existence application” for an appeal. mr king’s conduct as narrated in the supreme court’s minute is consistent with his approach to the substantive appeal in this court. mr king knows of his entitlement to apply for leave to appeal but after taking affirmative steps to advance that right of appeal to the supreme court he has made a deliberate decision not to exercise it. hemust accept the consequences. (c) adecision to recallwithin the court’s inherent power is onlymadein exceptional circumstances. a party should not seek recourse to that power if it might undermine the general principle of finality. in our judgment mrking is seeking to undermine that principle here.

[3] we therefore formally dismiss the application for leave to appeal.

editorial note: no suppression applied. in the district court at hamilton cri-2016-019-004445 [2017] nzdc 4002 the queen v tamate gough hearing: 28 february 2017 appearances: d mcwilliam for the crown j hamblett for the defendant judgment: 28 february 2017 notes of judge r g marshall on sentencing [1] mr gough appears for sentence on seven charges of burglary and six charges of unlawfully taking a motor vehicle. he has pleaded guilty to those charges following a sentence indication that i gave to him on 5 december last year. in that sentence indication i set out the circumstances of the offending, i dealt with the aggravating and mitigating features and also the various relevant case law and starting points. what i determine, mr gough, was in respect of these ram raids which involved 55 to $57,000 worth of damage to premises and also involved items taken and a further $24,000 damage to vehicles used in the ram raid that a starting point of four years and three months was appropriate. you are 17 years of age and still young so i gave you a credit of 15 percent for that which was eight months’ discount. from that i gave you a further 20 percent or close to 20 percent of a guilty plea and that brought it back to a further allowance of nine months. that left an end sentence of 34 months’ imprisonment or two years and 10 months. r v tamate gough [2017] nzdc 4002 [28 february 2017] [2] i have considered your pre-sentence report. you are seen as high risk of offending and a harm to others and there is an ongoing pattern of offending over the years. i do not see that there are any other credits available to you and also i note that you are not in a position to pay any reparation. accordingly, the end sentence in respect of the charges of burglary will be two years and 10 months' imprisonment and on the charges of unlawfully taking a motor vehicle, 12 months' imprisonment. all terms will be concurrent so the end sentence is one of two years and 10 months' imprisonment. r g marshall district court judge
in the court of appeal of new zealand ca79/2017 [2017] nzca 26 between nigelfraser gowing applicant and the queen respondent counsel: n m dutch forapplicant m lwong for respondent judgment: 24 february 2017 at 4.30 pm (on the papers) (bail) judgment of wild j the application is dismissed. reasons [1] this is an application for bail pending appeal. sections 14 and 55 of the bail act 2000 apply, as does s 343 of the criminal procedureact 2011. [2] having been convicted on a charge of injuring with intent to injure, on 20 january mr gowing was sentenced to six months home detention. he filed a notice of appeal in this court on 17 february and today, 24 february, applied for bail pending the hearing of that appeal. [3] the nub of the appeal is in paragraph 4 of mr dutch’s memorandum dated today: gowing v r [2017] nzca26[24february2017] a delay in hearing will effectively render the sentence aspect of the appeal nugatory. by the time of hearing the appellant is likely to have served much of his home detention sentence. [4] the short answer to this application is to bring the appeal on for hearing promptly. time is available in auckland on thursday9 march and ihave pencilled this appeal in with an estimated hearing time of one hour. [5] quite apart from the ability to hear the appeal promptly, i would not have granted bail. i cannot see here the exceptional circumstances that this court has held are required,1 and the fact that mr gowing’s sentence of home detention might have been largely completed by the time the appeal was heard (even if it were the case) is not sufficient to justify bail pending appeal.2 [6] for those reasons theapplication is dismissed. [7] mr dutch should contact this court’s registry to firm up the 9 march fixture and agree urgent timetabling of submissions with the crown. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent 1 whitehead v r [2014] nzca300 and iti v r [2012]nzca307. 2 hoffman v r [2016] nzca531 at [9].

[2] the executors of mr beaver’s will have now obtained probate in both new zealand and fiji and have realised all of mr beaver’s assets. this has resulted in the estate receiving a total sum of approximately $120,000 less expenses. [3] the executors have not yet been able to locate ms taina notwithstanding advertisements they have placed in the fiji times newspaper and enquiries they have made regarding her whereabouts through a firm of solicitors in fiji. [4] the executors of mr beaver’s will now seek an order authorising them to distribute mr beaver’s entire estate between his three children in equal shares. alternatively, they seek an order that ms taina’s share of the estate be debited with the costs the executors have incurred in attempting to locate her and the balance thereafter remaining be held on trust. [5] i consider it is too early at this stage to authorise the distribution of ms taina’s one-half share of the estate to the three children of the deceased. i therefore makeorders in terms ofthealternativeapplication advanced bythe executors. in the event that ms taina has not come forward by 31 december 2017, the executors should renew their application. in the meantime, the executors should place quarterly advertisements in a daily fiji newspaper seeking to establish contact with ms taina. lang j solicitors: wardill pasley law,auckland

in the high court of new zealand wellington registry civ-2017-485-96 [2017] nzhc 220 in the matter of section 14 of the wills act 2007 in the matter of the estate ofnicholas peter white (deceased) hearing: on the papers counsel: te hesketh judgment: 21 february 2017 judgment of clifford j [1] this is an application under s 14 of the wills act 2007, commenced by way of originating application as required by high court rule 19.2(xa), to declare a document to be a valid will. the applicant, the father of the deceased nicholas peter white whose estate is at issue (mr white snr), also applies to proceed on a without notice basis. [2] i deal first with the application to proceed without notice. mr white senior has provided affidavit evidence to the effect that the only persons with a beneficial interest in the estate of nicholas white are himself, nicholas white's mother, alison rae white, and nicholas white's brother, simon william white. mr white snr and mr white's mother and brother consent to the order sought being made. mr white snr has also, by affidavit, confirmed that nicholas white was not survived by a spouse, de facto partner or children entitled to succeed on testacy or any other children. mr white snr refers to various enquiries that have been made in that regard. [3] on that basis, i am satisfied that it is appropriate for this application to proceed without notice to any other paiiies. re white (deceased) [2017] nzhc 220 [21 february 2017] [4] i tum now to the substance of the application. [5] mr white snr annexed to his affidavit the document in question (the document). the document is a typed and handwritten document prepared by mr white snr, signed by nicholas white, and witnessed by mr white snr. the document is clearly intended to be nicholas white's last will and testament. nicholas white has not only signed the document, but also initialled the document where it has been completed in handwriting. mr white snr, in his affidavit, has given evidence of the circumstances in which the will was prepared and signed by nicholas white in his presence, and also in the presence of nicholas white's mother, mrs white. mrs white has confirmed those circumstances in her affidavit. the whites were simply unaware of the need for a will to be signed in the presence of, and witnessed by, two persons. [6] the document records nicholas white's decision to leave all his estate to his brother simon white. [7] i am satisfied that in terms of s 14 of the wills act 2007 it is appropriate that an order be made declaring the document to be the valid will of nicholas peter white, deceased, of palmerston notih, new zealand, finance manager. there is an order accordingly. solicitors: jacobs florentine, palmerston north

[2] mr north subsequently filed an application for a review of that sealed order. he took issue with three of the costs items listed in the schedule.2 the ground for the application was that the three items related to steps taken in other proceedings involving the north family and mr szekely, namely civ-2013-485-9825. muse on allen ltdv szekely [2016] nzhc 1131. in fact the application appears to take issue with four items, but one of them did not exist. muse on allen ltd v szekely [2017] nzhc 216 [21 february 2017] [3] on 8 november associate judge smith noted that he did not have jurisdiction to determine the application and ordered a two hour fixture before a justice of the comi at the earliest possible juncture. he also directed that mr no1ih pay the undisputed amount of $5,129 by 29 november 2016. this mr nmih duly did. [4] the review application came before me this morning. mr szekely had filed a notice of opposition and affidavit in support. the affidavit showed that the case management memoranda which gave rise to the disputed costs items were in fact filed in relation to both civ-2013-485-9825 and the present proceeding. mr haines confirmed that no claim for the costs associated with those memoranda will be made in the civ-2013-485-9825 matter (which was heard last week by mallon j). [5] although mr nmih had been sent notice of the hearing date he did not appear this morning. nor had he filed any submissions or other material taking issue with the position just outlined. [6] on that basis, and on the basis of the evidence before the comi, i agree with mr haines that the application should be dismissed and i so order. mr szekely is, again, entitled to his 2b costs.

[2] on 25 august 2016 ms chambers emailed a memorandum to the court on behalf of mr morris as to costs. the submissions of mr rainey on behalf of the plaintiff were emailed to the court on 13 february 2017. that memorandum records that the parties agreed to settle their litigation on a drop hands basis. ms chambers confirmed mr morris agreed to settle all matters subject to the existing order as to costs iearlier made. [3] as mr rainey submits it is clear that the only costs that the defendant is entitled to are those i ordered were payable when dismissing the application for summary judgment. [4] mr rainey’s calculations adopt steps 23, 24, 26 and 29 of schedule 3. [5] ms chambers’calculations are more wide-ranging. in the court’s view they include items that should not form part of the costs payable in this case, including for the commencement of a defence and the filing of a statement of defence. [6] in the court’s view mr rainey’s assessment is more accurate. however, the court considers costs should include an allowance for the filing of affidavits in opposition. three of those were filed. for the first two of those the court will allow fortwo days at the category2 rate of $1,990 per day. for the third of those the court will allow a half day at the category 2 rate of $2,230 per day. [7] apart from those additional matters, the court considers mr rainey’s assessment ought to be adopted except that the category 2 rate of $1,990 per day is to apply for the filing of the opposition and the two first affidavits in opposition to summary judgment. steps taken after 1 july 2015 are to be fixed at the category 2 rate of $2,230 per day. [8] ms morris is also to paythe $50 for the sealing of judgment costs. associate judge christiansen

[2] in conjunction with filing the appeal in the court of appeal, mr burgess applied for a dispensation from the requirement to pay security for costs; for their part, malley & co applied for an increased amount by way of security. the malley & co v burgess [2016]nzhc 907. garyowen burgess v malley&co [2017] nzsc 9 [16 february2017] deputy-registrar declined to waive security and increased the amount payable from the usual $6,600 to $10,000. [3] mr burgess then applied to have these decisions reviewed by a judge. miller j upheld the deputy-registrar’s decision not to waive security but granted the application to review the increased amount, reducing it to $6,600.2 mr burgess now seeks leave to appeal to this court against miller j’s decision to uphold the deputy-registrar’s decision to refuse to waive security. [4] these proceedings arise from a long-running relationship property dispute between mr burgess and his former partner. malley & co represented mr burgess in the relationship property proceedings. [5] it is not suggested that the proposed appeal raises any issue of general or publicimportance. rather, mr burgess argues thatmiller j erred bymisapplyingthe principles articulated by this court in reekie v attorney-general3 and by incorrectly assessing the merits of his appeal against gendall j’s decision. [6] as to the first point, miller j’s decision was an orthodox application of the principles set out in reekie. we are not persuaded that the principles have, or may have been, misapplied. [7] as to the second point, miller j concluded that the appeal was, in some respects, hopeless and in others “not strong”. again, nothing has been raised to cast doubt on this preliminary evaluation. [8] in these circumstances, we dismiss the application for leave to appeal. the applicant must paycosts of $2,500 to the respondents.4 solicitors: parker cowan, queenstown for respondents 2 burgess v malley & co [2016]nzca484. 3 reekie v attorney-general [2014] nzsc 63, [2014]1 nzlr 737. 4 sincethese reasonswere prepared,mrburgesshas fileda memorandumsayingthat he isnowin a positiontopaymost ofthe amount that he isrequiredtopaybywayofsecurityfor costs. that isan issue for the court ofappeal.

[2] since then the parties have failed to reach agreement as to costs. disputes have arisen about the appropriateness of evidence being referred to in a memorandum and affidavit, and the scale of costs that is applicable. there is also a dispute as to whether or not appropriate steps were taken to settle this matter before proceedings were issued. bowles & ors v beasley [2017] nzhc 180 [16 february 2017] [3] i have viewed the file and record that the parties agreed to the court determining the issue of costs by relying on the materials in the papers. [4] while it has taken some time for this matter to be resolved it is a straight forward case that bears many of the characteristics of in re tai in which baragwanath j awarded the applicants costs on a scale 1 a basis. 1 [5] in my assessment, that is the appropriate level of costs that the applicants should receive in this case. i order accordingly. db collins j solicitors: malley & co, christchurch for applicants rainey collins, wellington for respondent in re tai rotorua hc civ-2006-463-669, 7 februaiy 2007.
in the court of appeal of new zealand ca17/2017 [2017] nzca 9 between richie stuart clutterbuck appellant and the queen respondent counsel: appellant in person c j hurd for respondent judgment: 14 february 2017 (on the papers) judgment of harrison j application for bail pending determination of appeal is declined. reasons [1] following a trial in the christchurch district court the appellant, richie clutterbuck, was found guilty of one count of burglary of a timber yard. in december 2016 he was convicted and sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment. he appeals against his conviction on the principal ground of trial counsel error. [2] mrclutterbuck has applied for bail pending appeal. the crown opposes. mrclutterbuck must establish that on the balance of probabilities he should be granted bail pending appeal.1 he must show exceptional circumstances exist. within that inquiry the apparent strength of his appeal and any delay causing injustice are relevant considerations. see bail act 2000, ss14 and 55. clutterbuck v r [2017] nzca9 [14 february2017] [3] mrclutterbuck has sent abriefletter to the court settingout his grounds for seeking bail. first, he submits that a recent stomach operation (apparently before his trial) is causing him dietarydifficultieswithin the prison environment. hehas had to rely on his family and friends to buy his own food. however, mr clutterbuck has not produced evidence of either the adverse effect of this medical condition or that he cannot be properlycared for within the prison. this ground must fail. [4] second, mr clutterbuck refers to his primary ground of appeal that his trial counsel failed to follow his instructions in a number of respects including producing medical records of his stomach operation. apart from general allegations in his notice of appeal, mr clutterbuck has not provided any particulars or specific information or evidence which might support this allegation. [5] it is well settled that it is not appropriate when determining an application for bail pending an appeal to undertake an analysis of the merits or of the prospects of success. evidence that the appeal has some strength may be a relevant factor. but that is not the case here. apart from assertions, mr clutterbuck has not identified anything to suggest that his appeal has merit or is even arguable. moreover, mrclutterbuck faces the inherent difficultythat the lower court byits finding of guilt must have rejected the credibility of his exculpatory evidence at trial, including of his recent stomach operation. [6] mrclutterbuck’s application forbailpending determination ofhis appealis declined. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent

[2] the summary records that you were here in the christchurch courthouse and after being remanded in custody another prisoner was downstairs. he was in the cell first. you came in afterwards. there were other prisoners around at the time. you do not know the person from a bar of soap and neither does he know you according to the summary. [3] you then balled up some toilet paper, threw it up onto the cctv camera to hide the view, walked over to where the victim was seated, and kicked him in the head with the heel of your foot. he slumped forward and you did it again. the new zealand police v tyrone george whittaker [2017] nzdc 2794 [14 february 2017] police intervened. as a result of this the victim was taken to hospital where he spent a number of hours and suffered, fortunately, injuries that were not that serious. [4] as mr eason has explained to me, you are currently serving a three year two month sentence for charges of aggravated robbery and burglary. for some reason this was not sentenced at the same time but i now need to impose what effectively is an uplift on that sentence of three years two months to reflect the seriousness of this matter. [5] as i have discussed with mr eason, from my review of matters this is a very serious incident in terms of charges of assault with intent to injure. you are probably lucky it was not charged as a more serious offence. [6] in my assessment the appropriate starting point is two years bearing in mind the three year maximum available on this charge. i would then give you a discount of around about five months to account for your guilty plea which was reasonably early, but not at the earliest opportunity. finally, i need to take into account the totality principle because this is going to sit on top of the current sentences which you are serving. [7] with all of that in mind, you will be convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for 10 months on this charge which will be cumulative on the current sentence which you are serving. because your sentences total in excess of two years, the parole board will impose release conditions upon you. t j gilbert district court judge

in the district court at whangarei cri-2016-088-002742 [2017] nzdc 2309 new zealand police prosecutor v nathan joel dib defendant hearing: 8 february 2017 appearances: sergeant p rankin for the prosecutor k johnson for the defendant judgment: 8 february 2017 notes of judge k b de ridder on sentencing [1] mr dib, on 1 december you sought a sentence indication on a charge of burglary and the judge who dealt with that indicated an end sentence of three years’ imprisonment before any reductions for mitigating factors, and the matter was put off for you to consider and you came before me on 12 december and pleaded guilty to this charge on the basis of that indication. [2] i do not propose to go through exhaustively the summary of facts or the analysis embarked on by the judge who gave you that sentence indication. shortly put though, sometime between 4 o'clock and 12 o'clock between 27 and 28 may you went to this private residence here in whangarei, forced entry by jimmying a ranchslider and took a significant number of items from the house, including a computer and a number of items of jewellery. [3] in particular, these items had great significance and sentimental value to the owner because of the history of the jewellery and also the large amount of personal information stored on the computer. [4] the matter does not have to go back before the judge who gave you the indication because i have read his notes carefully, and with respect i agree with his analysis and am prepared to follow it. the only issue is by how much i should reduce that start point. [5] in my view, the only mitigating factor is your guilty plea and the issue is simply how much i should reduce that start point for that plea. the judge who gave you the indication indicated he would not give the maximum of one quarter and i agree entirely with that, given the length of time it took before this matter was finally resolved by your guilty plea. [6] also another factor which the supreme court referred to in the case of hessell v r1 was the likelihood of conviction and that tends to water down any benefit for a guilty plea. in this case, any chances of you escaping a conviction on this charge were very slim indeed, based on the fact that you were caught by dna evidence and you were also caught by a production order which revealed text data where you were trying to sell gold rings and a laptop computer on the same night as the burglary. [7] taking those two factors into account, in my view the discount would be reasonably generous even at 15 percent. on that basis, on this charge you are convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for two years and six months and you are ordered to pay reparation of $1000 to the complainant. finally, your current sentences of community work and supervision are cancelled. 1 hessell v r [2010] nzsc 135, [2011] 1 nzlr 607 k b de ridder district court judge

[2] the court disallowed the appeal and determined that consent ought be granted to the centre. [3] the court issued an interim costs decision3 on 31 january 2017 finding that a costs award would be made but directing denham to advise whether or not it was able to claim gst on the costs it incurred. denham has advised the court that it was entitled to claim gst. [4] on the basis that the court's decision was to award 30 per cent of planner's costs (i.e. $7,067.40) and 50 per cent of all other costs (i.e. $37,425.50), total costs would be $44,492.90 (including gst). denham advises that the amount of claimable gst was $5,803.42. the costs award the court will make is therefore $38,689.48. order [5] the appellants, lorraine edwards, melanie and michael galvin, ana matsis, charles norwood and helen benson, are to pay to denham construction limited the sum of $38,689.48. the appellants are jointly and severally liable for this award.

[2] it is not in dispute that costs are payable on the civil scale. the question is whether the appellant ought to have indemnity or increased costs. as to that, we are in agreement with the respondent. we make three points: marino v the chief executive of the departmentof corrections [2017] nzca2 [3 february2017] (a) there was nothing especially complex about the appeal. it was a question of statutoryconstruction, necessitating a review of legislative history; (b) habeas corpus is a summary procedure, and rarely should such an appeal take more time than a standard appeal. it is immaterial that a more extensive argument was mounted on further appeal, after mrmarino had been released; (c) nothing about the respondent’s conduct justifies increased costs. its view of the legislation was consistent with earlier judgments of this court on sentence appeals. following the supremecourt judgment, it is established that mr marino was unlawfully detained, but compensation for that is a separate matter. [3] theappellant willhave costs as fora standard appeal on aband abasis, with provision for second counsel (that is, a total of $13,380.00), with usual disbursements. we decline the respondent’s invitation to limit the award to costs actually paid by mr marino; that would be to exploit his counsel’s willingness to undertake work on a pro bono or discounted basis. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent
in the high court of new zealand wellington registry civ 2016-485-165 [2017] nzhc 59 between michael marino applicant and the chief executive of the department of corrections respondent hearing: on papers counsel: g edgeler for applicant d j perkins for respondent judgment: 1 february 2017 judgment of simon france j (costs) [1] the applicant unsuccessfully sought a writ of habeas corpus. an appeal was similarly unsuccessful. however, the supreme court upheld the legitimacy of his arguments concerning how his sentence should be calculated. the effect of that judgment is that the writ should have issued. [2] mr marino now seeks scale costs with a 50 per cent uplift for his original application. the respondent not only disputes the uplift but contends successful habeas corpus applicants are traditionally awarded even more modest amounts. admit to finding both positions unpersuasive. marino v the chief executive of the department of corrections [2017] nzhc 59 [1 february 2017] [3] addressing first mr marino, it was standard litigation conducted appropriately by the respondent. the department was applying apparently settled, albeit incorrect law. the uplift seems to be motivated by a belief that scale costs are inadequate. that is an argument consistently rejected. although strictly speaking the discretion granted under s 14(4) of the habeas corpus act 1991 is wider than the rules as to costs, in my view some good reason should still be needed to depart from them. [4] the fact that habeas corpus involves the liberty of the subject is not such a reason. if there has been unlawful imprisonment, adequate routes exist for compensation. the focus should be on the nature and conduct of the particular proceeding. [5] similarly i see no reason for limiting costs to something less than scale. the respondent suggests there is some significance in the fact that it carries the onus, but i do not see that as a relevant reason to depart from the scale. [6] the applicant is entitled to costs on a 2b basis. as is the norm, such costs cannot exceed the actual costs. ifthere is disagreement as to disbursements, it is to be settled by the registrar. simon france j

[2] the facts are that by day mr nathan and others went to burgle the complainant’s house. a significant amount of property was removed. the complainant came home in the course of this and interrupted mr nathan. amongst the property mr nathan had taken was a martial arts weapon called a sai. it's presence in the home obviously did not alert mr nathan in the way it might have done but the bad choice he had made was that he was burgling the home of a martial arts expert. when that man confronted him mr nathan presented the sai and advanced on the home owner with it but was soon disarmed. i am afraid i cannot r v hohepa haora nathan [2017] nzdc 1017 [19 january 2017] accept that the fact that the home owner was able to manage the situation as he did constitutes any sort of mitigating feature. the long and short of it is that mr nathan had got himself into possession of a weapon and when he thought he needed it to facilitate the burglary he produced it and advanced with it and the situation really is not much distinguishable from a situation where a weapon was taken to the property. there is a difference but the essential intent involved in this offending is not greatly different. [3] there is not much disagreement about what the starting point should be. there is disagreement about whether a minimum period of imprisonment should be imposed. the defendant is now over 30 years of age. he has previous convictions including 12 for burglary and one for aggravated robbery. there are no mitigating features to the case. in my view the correct starting point is one of four years’imprisonment for the offence itself to be uplifted by six months in respect to the defendant’s previous serious convictions of a similar kind. [4] on the question of a minimum non-parole period it is certainly close to the threshold of that but i am not clearly satisfied that that is necessary. mr nathan will be before the parole board in due course and they can decide his release date according to progress if any made in prison. a j adeane district court judge

[2] i do not intend to traverse the reasons why that sentence has come about and will direct that the notes i made at the time of that sentencing indication be attached to today’s notes and that will then complete the record and the reasons as to why i arrived at the sentence that i did. however you know that this all started when you in a very brutal way treated your partner to the point where she suffered severe injury and the most serious of the offences was the charge of injuring with intent to injure. i have taken that as the lead offence today. i read your letter of apology and i have read your letter of remorse. perhaps that has come about because of the new zealand police v chris tikau [2017] nzdc 614 [17 january 2017] probation officer’s observations that you did not seem to be remorseful but i accept that what you have written is a show of remorse and you have extended an apology not just to the victim but to her family and that is accepted. i do not intend to make any further deduction from sentence for that the indicated sentence was a relatively lenient one for the offences that you committed. there was the injuring with intent to injure. there was a burglary which is you getting into the place to carry out that injury. there is a charge of assault with intent, unlawfully carrying ammunition, receiving stolen property. there was another burglary included in all of this, there was a male assaults female charge, possession of instruments for using cannabis and also for possessing cannabis. [3] the sentence that i will pass today, bearing in mind what i have just said, is the sentence of two years and four months’ imprisonment on the charge of injuring with intent. on the charge of burglary three months’ sentence concurrent. on the charge assaulting with intent to injure your partner a 10 month concurrent sentence is passed. on the charge of maleassaults female sixmonths’sentence is imposed and then the charge of the other burglary one month sentence imposed concurrently. possession of the cannabis convicted and discharged in light of the term of imprisonment you have received. on the receiving charge three months’ imprisonment is imposed and on the charge that you were in possession of the ammunition one month imprisonment but that is concurrent as well. the final charge is possession of utensils for using cannabis you are convicted and discharged in respect of that. both the supervision sentence and the community work that you are currently on both of those sentences have now been cancelled. [4] mr tikau you will also have made today against you a protection order which will be in favour of your former partner and will contain the usual standard conditions of a protection order made in the family court. you will get some notice served on you about that. p r connell district court judge

[4] the applicant filed a number of documents in this court in support of his application for leave, but none of these provided any basis for calling into question the lawfulness of his detention. rather, the documentation appears to challenge the jurisdiction of the courts over the applicant on maori sovereignty grounds and assert that the applicant is himself sovereign and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the courts. there is nothing in these documents that provides any support for the applicant’s assertions.

[2] i now have the pre-sentence report for mr otimi-stowers. it records matters we already know, he is a young man, it records perhaps disappointingly, at least when interviewed he displayed little remorse for his actions and on assessment he is assessed as a high risk of future offending given the recidivist nature of the charges and his young age. the report writer recommends a short rehabilitation programme for mr otimi-stowers and i agree with that. it is important he receives some form of intensive rehabilitation while serving his sentence of imprisonment. the report also new zealand police v shay otimi-stowers [2017] nzdc 26651 [23 december 2016] recommends special conditions; however that would only apply if the sentence was less than two years which it will not be. [3] concern was raised today via counsel that mr otimi-stowers was of the understanding he would serve the whole sentence. as a parole board convenor, the only reason he would serve the whole sentence would be if he shows bad behaviour in prison and does not do his programmes. if mr otimi-stowers shows good behaviour in prison and takes advantage of any programmes offered to him, that should stand him in good stead to be considered for parole and potentially early release but ultimately those matters are for the parole board when they see mr otimi-stowers which i would expect the parole board would certainly see him within the first half of 2017 for parole to be considered. [4] the circumstances and facts of the offending are contained in the sentence indication of 9 november and in that decision i traversed all relevant matters pertaining to sentencing. accordingly, that sentencing indication is to be attached to these sentencing notes and forms part of the sentencing. [5] there is nothing in the pre-sentence report or that i have heard today which would affect the sentence indication and accordingly on each of the burglary and attempted burglary charges, i impose a sentence of two years two months’ imprisonment. on the charge of failing to stop for police which is fine only, i convict and discharge. on the dangerous driving charge, i impose a sentence of two months’imprisonment, that will be concurrent with the two years two months and i impose a disqualification from holding or obtaining a driver’s licence for nine months commencing from today. likewise, on the unlawful taking charges, two years two months’imprisonment. ido not fix release conditions, that is a matter for the parole board when parole comes to be considered.

[2] as you are well aware, the jury found you guilty of that charge and i entered a conviction. subsequently, i wondered whether that was an appropriate conviction because you were charged as a s 66(1) party and it was not alleged that you had yourself physically stolen the isuzu elf. what was alleged was that mr mcdonnell had been in possession of the motor vehicle and that you were a party to its theft by mr mcdonnell, or by one of the others in the group. the principal evidence of that was that you were found in possession of the elf. [3] of course, the jury acquitted all of your other co-defendants on the charge of theft of the elf and so my view is that the conviction that should have been entered was on a charge of receiving the elf knowing it to be stolen property. [4] i do not have the power to change the conviction. the jury found you guilty of the charge, i entered a conviction, and now only the court of appeal can deal with the situation, if that is what you decide to do. what i will do, though, is sentence you on the basis that you received the elf. [5] my view is that, given the year-long period that you were on restrictive bail conditions and given the fact that you were remanded in custody for nearly seven weeks over the course of the trial, it would not be in the interests of justice to add any further penalty. accordingly, i discharge you now without further penalty so that in legal terms you have been convicted and discharged. you may stand down. brewer j

[3] witness a is aged 94. he lives with his daughter, witness b. they live at the property where the victim was stabbed and they found her body lying in their garden soon after. apart from the obvious trauma they will have suffered as a result of this tragic event, they have been subjected to considerable intrusion from members of the public stopping outside their property and peering in. they state that members of the public frequently stand outside their house and in their driveway pointing and staring at their house while they can be seen in their kitchen or working outside in their garden. they are concerned that if their names and address are published, this unwelcome and unreasonable invasion of their privacy will worsen considerably. [4] 1 accept that the concerns expressed by these witnesses about the likely effects on them of having their names and address published are genuine and well­founded. this case has attracted considerable publicity and public interest. however, there is no legitimate public interest in knowing the identity of the witnesses who had the misfortune of living at the property where the victim died. am satisfied that these witnesses will suffer undue hardship if their identifying particulars are published. this is particularly so, given that witness a is elderly and witness b is caring for him in their home. result [5] make an order pursuant to s 202 of the criminal procedure act 2011 forbidding publication of the name, address or occupation of witness a and witness b. ma gilbert j

[2] following his death the personal effects of the deceased were distributed in accordance with the 30 may 2015 document, and the four children signed the document acknowledging receipt of those items on 21 june 2015.

[6] having regard to the affidavit evidence of ms ford, it is clear that the document attached to the application and described as the last will and testament of anthony paul flanagan does express the deceased’s testamentary intentions. as all persons who would be affected by this application have provided their consent to the application being granted, i am satisfied it is appropriate to do so.

[2] the plaintiff has now filed a memorandum, seeking increased costs. nothing has been filed by the defendant. award of costs [3] the plaintiff is entitled to costs. the question is whether i should award increased costs. [4] mr mcbride says i should increase costs for two reasons. first, it is submitted that the plaintiff “should never have been put to the trouble of having to obtain interim orders”, sayingthat “the threat to destroya swimmingpool and park it outside the plaintiff’s showroom was an unreasonable stance for the first defendant to take.” however, the unreasonable conduct complained of, for costs purposes, must be in relation to the proceeding, and not before it was commenced. i decline to increase costs on this basis. [5] the second reason for increasing costs, says mr mcbride, is that “[t]he plaintiff is prepared to resolve the dispute by way of a district court proceeding, but the first defendant has ignored that offer.” nothing more is said by mr mcbride about the terms of the offer, and there is no material provided to the court to evidence the making of an offer, so i am unable to assess the reasonableness or otherwise of the first defendant having refused that offer. [6] for thesereasons, i decline to award increased costs. [7] the plaintiff is entitled to 2b costs, in the sum of $7,582 plus $200 in reasonable disbursements. paul davison j

[2] the appellant, ms deborah waxman, says she succeeded in two of three grounds of appeal. ms waxman submits the judgment overlooked a document filed by ms waxman called “points of appeal” of 12 may 2016. a paragraph of that document suggested, contrary to her notice of appeal, she was not challenging the dismissal of her original application but only procedural unfairness issues and indemnity costs. ms waxman’s memorandum also, inappropriately and irrelevantly for the issue of costs, takes issue with aspects of the reasoning of the judgment. and it objects to part of the costs award i substituted for the district court’s award of indemnity costs in upholding part of ms waxman’s appeal. ms waxman seeks costs. [3] the respondent, mr mark crouch, submits ms waxman was unsuccessful in her substantive appeal, her points of appeal document does not say what she now says it does and the focus of her appeal was not what she now says it is. he submits he has incurred costs in opposing ms waxman’s appeal and seeks costs in his favour. [4] the submissions of both parties confirm my original inclination that costs should lie where they fall for the appeal. based on a realistic appraisal of the end result, i consider the parties enjoyed a relatively equal measure of success and failure.3 i decline to make the orders sought. palmer j 1 waxman v crouch [2016]nzhc 2004. 2 at [50]. 3 packing in ltd (in liq) formerly known as bond cargo ltd v chilcott (2004) 9 nzclc 263, (2003) 16 prnz958 (ca) at [6].

[2] rule 14.8 of the high court rules provides that, on an opposed interlocutory application, costs are to be fixed when the application is determined and payable when they are fixed, unless there are special reasons to the contrary. flujo asserts that there are special reasons, namely that the balance of convenience was found to weigh in its favour and that the evidence did show that it had lost sales and that merisant had “sailed deliberately close to the wind when re-designing their packaging.” flujo’s perspective is that the outcome of the application reflected the inability of the court to resolve conflicting evidence in the interlocutorycontext. [3] ido not accept that these are special reasons that justify reserving costs at this stage. in terms of the evidence, the problem for flujo was not so much a conflict of evidence but an absence of evidence necessary to show confusion in the market as a result of merisant’s product. it is true that the balance of convenience did favour flujo. but given the lack of a substantial evidential foundation to show a serious question to be tried, that fact could not justify interim relief and nor does it justify departing from r 14.8. [4] i do not, however, accept merisant’s assertion that costs should be allowed on a combined 2b and 2c basis. the affidavit evidence was of a nature and extent ordinarily found in applications of this kind. there was no special urgency. the matter was argued on established legal principles. i consider that costs on a 2b basis which merisant calculate at $7,379 is appropriate, together with disbursements of $160. p courtney j
there is an interim order prohibiting publication of the names of the parties and any information leading to the parties' identity. in the employment court auckland [2016] nzempc 148 empc 282/2016 inthe matter of a compliance order and in the matter a non-publication order between ala plaintiff and ite defendant hearing: on the papers counsel: m ward-johnson, for plaintiff judgment: 15november 2016 interlocutory judgment of judge christina inglis [1] the plaintiff has filed a statement of claim seeking orders relating to an alleged breach of a compliance order made by this court. the claim arises out of, and is related to, earlier proceedings in which a compliance order was made against the defendant and in which permanent non-publication orders were made by the court.1 [2] the plaintiff has applied for non-publication orders in this proceeding. the application has been advanced on a without notice basis. mr ward-johnson has certified that the application complies with the applicable rules. ite v ala [2016] nzempc 42. alavite nzempc auckland [2016] nzempc 148[15 november 2016] [3] i am satisfied, based on the affidavit filed in support of the application, that serving notice of the application on the defendant would likely undermine the non-publication orders previously made by the court, that there is a substantial risk that the plaintiff’s position in respect of non-publication would be prejudiced, and that it is in the interests of justice that the application be dealt with on a without notice basis. [4] i am also satisfied that as well as non-publication orders, associated orders should be made preventing any person from searching the court file without the prior leave of a judge of this court. such orders are necessary, at least at this stage, to ensure the preservation of the court’s original orders and to preserve the plaintiff’s position. [5] the defendant is, however, entitled to be heard in respect of whether the orders made in this interlocutory judgment should continue or be set aside, and/or whether such orders ought to be made on a permanent basis. [6] accordingly, the following orders are made: -an interim order prohibiting publication of the names and/or identifying details of either party to the plaintiff’s claim; -an interim order preventing any person from searching the court file, without the prior leave of a judge of this court. [7] the interim orders identified in [6] will remain in place pending further order of the court. [8] leave is reserved for either party to apply, on reasonable notice, for further directions or orders.

[2] originally the proceeding named justices of the supreme comi as second respondents. an application was made to have them removed as paiiies. the high court, applying established principle, determined the judges were not properly joined and accordingly they were struck out as parties. costs were awarded to the parties struck out. [3] in accordance with the judge's direction a memorandum was filed in which the amount of costs sought is set out. classifying the proceedings as category one proceedings of a straightforward naturei and the time allocations as being in band "a" requiring a comparatively small amount of time2 the calculation results in costs of $888.00. high court rule 14.3. high court rule 14.5. rabson v judicial conduct commissioner [2016] nzhc 2713 [11 november 2016] [4] the costs incurred, however, are $770.00. because the costs incmted are less than the scale calculation of costs an order is sought only for the costs incmted.

(ii) was the amount awarded to the applicant under s 15 of the property (relationships) act 1976 correct? (iii) should the order that the remuera properties be sold, rather than vested in the applicant, have been made? scott v williams [2016] nzsc 149 [9 november 2016] reasons [1] the approved questions are framed so as to permit the parties to advance all of the arguments foreshadowed in their respective applications for leave. [2] the grant of leave does not indicate a final decision that the court will deal with all of the issues raised in the applications for leave. either party may advance arguments as to why any issue should not be determined on grounds of procedural fairness, inadequacy of evidential foundation or otherwise. [3] we do not see the fact that the court of appeal refused leave to appeal on the halving and contingency discount issues in relation to s 15 of the property (relationships) act 1976 as precluding this court from addressing those points.1 section 7(b) of the supreme court act 2003 precludes this court from hearing and determining an appeal against a decision of the court of appeal refusing to give leave or special leave to appeal to that court. it does not, however, preclude this court from addressing an aspect of an issue arising from a substantive appeal decision of the court of appeal even though that aspect was not addressed by the court of appeal because leave to appeal on that aspect was refused by the court of appeal. this does not qualify what we have said in [2] above, however. solicitors: tompkins wake, hamilton for applicant north harbour law, auckland for respondent scott v williams [2015] nzca 258.

[2] having read the judgment under appeal, the affidavit of the appellant in support of the application for stay and counsel’s memorandum in support, i am satisfied that a temporary stay of the judgment should be ordered. [3] there is an order that the interim orders made in favour of the appellant in the family court on 30 august 2016 remain in force pending further order of this court. this order is made on the followingconditions: (a) the order is to be served forthwith on the respondent, together with a copy of this judgment. (b) the respondent mayapplyon three day’s notice to set the order aside. (c) counsel for both parties are to file memoranda, without delay, addressing all relevant matters specified in schedule 6 to the high court rules for the purpose of expediting a hearing of the appeal. [4] i am satisfied that an order for temporary stay is justified for two main reasons. first, the appellant has a reasonably arguable case that he is entitled to an order preventing the respondent from continuing to distribute emails, and other electronic information, as referred to in the judgment under appeal and in the appellant’s affidavit. second, it is not apparent that any material prejudice would be caused to the respondent if the interim orders granted on 30 august 2016 remain in force with the respondent having a right to apply on notice to set the stay aside. woodhouse j sv s [2016] nzfc8740.

[2] the application has been made on an ex parte basis because of information referred to in mr king’s affidavit that the property is the subject of an agreement for its sale, with settlement to take place on 31 october 2016. [3] mr king has provided evidence by way of affidavit that he lent ms dixon a total of $21,000, paid to her in instalments between 22 april 2015 and 24 june 2016. he says the payments were made pursuant to an oral agreement that the monies would be repaid to him on the sale of the property. [4] mr king says he learnt the property was on the market in august 2016. he has said that he has made repeated attempts since that month to obtain confirmation from ms dixon that she would repay the loan but there has been no response. there king v dixon [2016] nzhc 2584 [28 october 2016] was also no response to a letter to a similar affect sent to ms dixon by mr king’s solicitor and dated 16 september 2016. [5] the high court rule 17.40 permits this court to make a charging order on ms dixon’s interest in the property being sold, charging her interest in the property with payment of the amount for which mr king may obtain judgment. [6] pursuant to r 17.41, the court must be satisfied ms dixon is disposing of the property with intent to act illegitimately and with intent to defeat mr king’s interest and entitlement to repayment of the loan. a high standard of proof is required.1 that proof can be established by way of inference from available evidence.2 [7] the evidence does establish a strong prima facie case that mr king is entitled to repayment to him of $21,000 from the proceeds of sale of ms dixon’s property. her failure to respond to communications from both him and his solicitor do indicate that she is intending to sell the property without meeting what appear to be her obligations with regard to repayment of the loans which he has made to her. [8] i am thus satisfied this is an appropriate case for a charging order to be made. an order is accordingly made in terms of the draft order filed by the applicant’s solicitors. [9] leave is reserved to the respondent to seek the variation or discharge of this order on three days’notice. solicitors: aws legal, invercargill 1 joseph lynch land co v lynch (1992) 6 prnz 37 at 44. 2 re cox, ex parte coughlan [2015] nzhc 1014.

[2] the draft statement of claim against solutions personnel ltd and blue collar ltd sets out a number of allegations relating to their asserted role in placing mr prasad and ms tulai with lsg, and the arrangements under which these placements are said to have occurred. a declaration that either one or both of the plaintiffs were party to a contract with solutions personnel ltd is sought, together with a determination as to the nature of any such contractual relationship (employment or kamlesh prasad v lsg sky chefs new zealand limited nzempc auckland [2016] nzempc 133 [26 october 2016] contract for services). a declaration is also sought that mr prasad was party to an employment agreement with blue collar ltd. [3] the court has the power to order that parties be joined under s 221(a) of the employment relations act 2000. it provides that the court may make such an order in order to enable it to more effectively dispose of any matter before it according to the substantial merits and equities of the case. 1 in the present case joining the proposed third parties will likely facilitate this end by enabling all disputes relating to the same subject matter (namely whether either or both of the plaintiffs were in an employment relationship at the relevant time and if so with whom) to be determined without the delay and expense of separate proceedings. [4] in the circumstances leave is granted to issue the third party notice on solutions personnel ltd and blue collar ltd.

[8] hortiventure says it prepared the common bundle. [9] in my assessment, while hortiventure may have taken some steps to prepare items that would go into a bundle, it seems that alpine actually assembled the final version of the bundle, printed it and added in significant portions. [1 o] in my assessment, at most, hortiventure should get only one-quaiier of the costs for this step. opposition to early possession application and supporting affidavit [11] ms meares, counsel for alpine is correct when she says the proper award for a notice in opposition and supporting affidavit is $3,980 as per item 38 in the schedule. hmiiventure is entitled to 75 per cent of $3,980 to reflect the fact that 25 per cent was awarded in the stay application. db collins j solicitors: wynn williams, christchurch for applicant parry field lawyers, christchurch for respondent

[3] mr singh sangha has long-standing problems with his kidneys and they were apparent at the time of the trial and sentencing. his chronic pain was one factor in my decision to commute what would have been a short term of imprisonment into one of home detention. 1 r v sangha [2015] nzhc 37. [4] at the end of march this year, mr singh sangha had a kidney removed. the level of on-going pain associated with its removal is at a level that prevents him doing the types of physical work involved in a community work sentence. he has done only 32 of the 300 hours he was ordered to serve. i am satisfied that the remaining 268 hours of community work should be cancelled. the question is what substituted sentence should be imposed. the remaining 268 hours is a significant component of the overall sentence and there should be another component to make up for it. [5] mr taylor deposes that mr singh sangha has been fully compliant with his sentence of home detention and i could extend that by a further two months. this afternoon, ms lyall indicates that he has found that a difficult sentence and that is the approach that sentencing judges appreciate when home detention is substituted for what would otherwise be a term of imprisonment. [6] the alternative is that mr singh sangha has a limited capacity to pay a fine, if over a period of time. there can be no mathematical formula for dollars fined per hour not completed of community work. i have had regard to mr singh sangha’s personal circumstances. in addition, although it cannot directly be attributed to him, i have had regard to the clear impression i obtained by the end of the trial that significant amounts of money were involved in at least some parts of the immigration fraud to which he was a party. [7] i consider a fine is the appropriate substitute sentence and i will impose a fine of $2,500. [8] the outcome of the application is that i cancel the outstanding community work sentence and substitute a fine of $2,500. dobson j solicitors: department of corrections, motueka bamford law, nelson for defendant

[2] the appellants assert a miscarriage of justice as a result of: (a) the crown leading inadmissible propensity evidence in re-examination of the complainant about the alleged sexual violation of another girl by mr mould; (b) the judge declaring a crown witness, nathan mould (isaac mould’s brother), hostile; (c) the judge refusing to allow mr mould’s trial counsel to cross-examine a witness called by mr mciver on whether the complainant had previously accused that witness of rape. [3] in addition, mr mould asserts that a miscarriage of justice resulted from evidence by the complainant’s mother of seeing him with an ankle bracelet. [4] the crown responds that no miscarriage of justice occurred: the propensity evidence was adequately met with a strong direction from the trial judge; the judge’s decision to declare nathan mould a hostile witness was justified; there was no basis for allowing evidence about a previous rape allegation by the complainant; and the evidence of the complainant’s mother about mr mould’s ankle bracelet was dealt with in a practical and effective manner, which avoided any unfair prejudice. the offending [5] the offending was said to have occurred after a bonfire beach party at woodend beach in canterbury on 23 may 2014. mr mould (then aged 19) and his younger brother, nathan mould, asked the complainant if she wanted to go with them. nathan mould and the complainant were both 16 years old. mr mould, nathan mould and two friends of mr mould picked the complainant up from her home at about 7.00 pm. mr mould then bought liquor, including rtds for his brother and the complainant. [6] when they got to the beach the boys started the bonfire and the group sat around talking and drinking. later others joined the group. these included mrmciver and another man, neither of whom were known to the complainant. at some point in the evening there were minor incidents involving two of the defendants’ friends that made the complainant feel uncomfortable. these included one rubbing the complainant’s thigh and another responding to her request for a bite of his cheeseburger by saying that she could if she let him touch her breast. after these incidents the complainant asked nathan mould to walk her to the toilet block. when they returned she sat on the other side of the fire. she decided not to drink anymore and lay down in front of the fire. [7] the next thing the complainant remembered was being led into the sand dunes by mr mciver and one of the other men. she did not want to go with them and said that she wanted to go back to the bonfire but theyignored her. theystarted tokissher. theywere then joined bymr mould and two others. nathan mould was still at the bonfire, unaware of what was happening. [8] the complainant found herself on the ground with mr mould on top of her. he raped her. she was screaming and trying to push him off. the other men were laughing and joking while this was happening. there was evidence that mr mciver and another man were holding her down by the shoulders. mr mciver then raped her. [9] eventually, nathan mould came to see what was happening. he saw mrmciver on top of the complainant and shouted at himand pulled himoff. he then took the complainant back to the toilet block where he helped her to clean herself up. [10] the defence case was that the complainant had consensual group sex with the men and regretted it later. first ground of appeal: inadmissible propensity evidence about mr mould propensity evidence elicited inadvertently [11] it was common ground that the complainant had spent time with mr mould after the night of the bonfire. mr mould relied heavily on the evidence about this contact to support his assertion that the earlier sexual activity had been consensual. the complainant was cross-examined about a night approximately a month after the alleged rape when she went to mr mould’s house with a friend, b, and b’s boyfriend. the defence asserted that during the evening the complainant had, at one point, walked around partially naked inviting sex. [12] under cross-examination by mr greig, who was counsel for mr mould at trial, the complainant said that the group had got drunk together, she passed out and when she woke up b had been raped by mr mould. the assertion that mr mould had raped b was entirely unexpected and, clearly, inadmissible. there was no reference in either the complainant’s or b’s statements that could have alerted trial counsel to the risk of such an allegation being made. mr greig did not engage with it and continued his cross-examination. in answering other questions about that evening the complainant made three further references to the alleged rape of b. mrgreig ignored these references too. [13] in re-examination, however, the prosecutor referred to the allegation: okay. you also talked about that being the night as i understood you, that you said isaac had raped [b] and you described the circumstances. is that right? [14] the prosecutor then mentioned another piece of evidence, about the complainant having written the acronym “bae” on mr mould’s bedside table, and asked: q: now it’s been suggested that the … “bae” was you announcing that you were isaac’s significant other, what do you have to say about that? a: no, no, i call my dog “bae”. q: i see okay. now you also in your evidence said that it was this night as i understood it that isaac raped [b]. you’re nodding your head yes? a: yes but she didn’ttell me until she came back to my house. q: and when was that? a: the next morning. application for mistrial [15] mr greig applied for a mistrial on the basis that the allegation that mr mould had raped b was irrelevant and deliberately put before the jury in a manner that was highly prejudicial and could not be cured by a direction to the jury. [16] the prosecutor resisted the application on the (inconsistent) grounds that (1) the issue had arisen from mr greig’s own cross-examination and could not be ignored; (2) her reference to it in re-examination had been for the purpose of accurately determining the timing of when the complainant had got drunk with mrmould so as to meet the suggestion that, contrary to what the complainant maintained, she had had contact with mr mould after finding out about him raping b; and (3) the application for a mistrial was tactical only. [17] whilst acknowledging that the evidence was irrelevant to the issues that the jury had to consider and might be seen as having some prejudicial effect on mrmould, gendall j nevertheless did not consider it serious enough to declare a mistrial.1 he noted, too, that the allegation had arisen from mr greig’s own cross-examination two days previously with no issue being taken at that point. the r v mould [2015] nzhc 2842. judge considered that the matter could be appropriatelydealt with bya firm direction to the jury. [18] in summing up the judge gave a very firm direction: members of the jury, there is one further specific direction i need to make to you at this point. you may remember that when [the complainant] was being cross-examined, i think during the week before last, she said that [b], her friend, had told her that on the night of the drinking session at isaac mould’s house, which i think was the night when they all stayed the night, isaac mould had raped [b]. then, later in ms orchard’s re-examination of [the complainant] you will have heard this was mentioned again. now this evidence and these claims by [the complainant] of what [b] had told her is hearsay. itisinadmissible asevidencein this trialandit is quite irrelevantto matters which are before you. you can have absolutely no idea about the truth or otherwise of this bare allegation. it is merely a completely unsubstantiated claim and is entirely irrelevant in this case and it would be unfair and plainly wrong to take this evidence into account here. so you are to put these claims in [the complainant’s] evidence as to what she had been told by [b] completely out of your minds. i direct you firmly that they are irrelevant here. and you must ignore them completely when you make your deliberations on the charges which are before you. appeal [19] mr greig submitted that the way the prosecutor had referred to mr mould raping b suggested that it was a fact rather than an allegation and was especially damaging because it related to a witness that the jury had already heard giving evidence. he characterised it as an entirely gratuitous effort to blacken mr mould’s character by using evidence that had plainly been elicited inadvertently in cross-examination. [20] mr greig also emphasised that mr mould was found guilty by majority verdict and submitted that the jury was sufficiently cautious of the complainant’s evidence to make a request to re-visit it, which was refused. we take this submission to be a reference to the jury’s request to view the complainant’s second evidential interview again. all defence counsel, including mr greig, opposed that course and the judge refused the request.2 we do not accept that the jury’s request necessarily indicated caution over her evidence or even that it related to mr mould. r v mould [2015] nzhc 2953. [21] the decision to re-introduce the allegation that mr mould had raped b was a very poor one. it inevitably carried a risk of prejudice to mr mould. although we accept mr corlett qc’s submission for the crown that the prosecutor was using it to orient the witness to the night on which other events that were to be re-examined had occurred, therewereother means bywhich that could havebeen done. however, the real issue is whether the prejudice to mr mould as a result of the evidence was remedied by the judge’s direction. we are satisfied that it was. the judge gave a particularly firm and explicit direction. not only did he direct the jury that it should not take the evidence into account at all, but he gave clear reasons for his direction that would have been readily understood by the jury. this ground of appeal therefore fails. second ground of appeal: declaring nathan mould hostile nathan mould’s evidence-in-chief [22] nathan mould gave a statement to the police about the events of the relevant night, which included: all the guys were around her, that’s isaac, ky and mitch, brook and troy. i couldsee themkissingher. ithinkit was either brookortroy. i’mnot sure which one was kissing her. and later: when i got closer and then i heard [the complainant] screaming. it was two decent loud screams. i went much quicker towards her. when i got to where she was i sawtroy on top of her and he was having sex with her. … i knew that they had had sex with [the complainant] and i thought she didn’t want it because of the screaming i heard from her. i had never heard screams like that before. i knew something was wrong. [23] when nathan mould gave evidence, however, he departed from these statements. he was asked whether he had difficulty recollecting or difficulty about the matters he needed to talk about that day and responded that he had difficulties with both. asked if, in terms of recollection, it would help if he saw his statement, he answered affirmatively and, with the judge’s permission, was provided with a typed copy of his statement to refresh his memory. [24] alittle later in his evidence-in-chiefthe notes of evidence again indicate that he was having difficulty. at one point there was the following exchange between him and the prosecutor: q: is there anything that could be done to help you through this, to make this easier? a: not atthe moment sorry. i just find this really difficult. [25] after that the prosecutor went on to question nathan mould about what happened after he and the complainant came back from the toilets and she sat on the other side of the fire. he described seeing the complainant walking off with brook norris and troymciver and said: a: [the complainant] was kissing brook and troy after i’d come back from the toilet. q: she was kissing them or the other way around? a: she was kissing them. [26] then nathan mould described staying at the bonfire and seeing mr mould and two others walking off towards where the complainant, brook and mr mciver had gone. he described one of the other men returning to the fire and asking whether he wanted to join them. they did not tell him what was happening. nathan mould remained where he was for another few minutes and then walked over to where the rest of the group was. when asked whether he could hear or see anything as he went he said: a: i heard a scream but i’m not sure what type of scream it was. q: you’re not surewhat type of scream it was? a: no, no. q: one scream or more? a: was it twice i think. q: now i want you to stop there. i know it’s not easy but remember you’re on your oath? a: yeah. q: and try and take yourself back there and describe thatscream to us? a: it was either an enjoyment or distress i’m not sure. q: enjoyment or distress? a: yeah. q: you’re not sure? a: yeah. [27] towards the end of this evidence-in-chief the prosecutor returned to the issue of the screams: q: now i just want to go back a little bit. you said that you heard [the complainant]scream as you walked towards those dunes? a: yes. q: and when asked to describe those screams you said you couldn’t say whether they were screams of, how did you put it? a: enjoyment or — can’t remember the other word now. enjoyment or distress. judge declares nathan mould hostile [28] at that point the prosecutor sought a direction from the judge to have nathan mould declared hostile. [29] section 4(1) of the evidence act 2006 defines “hostile” in relation to a witness as including that the witness: … gives evidence that is inconsistent with a statement made by that witness in a manner that exhibits, or appears to exhibit, an intention to be unhelpful to the party who called the witness … [30] theapplication was opposed bydefencecounsel on the basisthat the witness had not shown any unwillingness to help in the evidence he provided to the court and that the evidence he gave had been no more than a minor deviation from his earlier statements to the police. [31] gendall j declared nathan mould hostile, allowing him to be cross-examined on his earlier statement:3 … the evidence which [nathan mould] has given before this court in relation to the two matters [the crown] has raised, in my view, is evidence that is inconsistent with his earlier police statement in a manner that appears to exhibit an intention to be unhelpful to the crown in this matter. in a sense, this is not entirely surprising, given the close relationship between the witness, mr nathan mould, and the first named defendant, his brother, mr isaac mould. [32] nathan mould was subsequently cross-examined on the inconsistencies between his statements. he acknowledged his earlier statement to the police but did not accept that he had thought, even at the time of making it, that the complainant’s screams were necessarily screams of anguish and not screams of pleasure. appeal [33] mr greig submitted that there was no basis on which to declare nathan mould hostile; in terms of who was kissing whom the earlier statement regarding kissing was ambiguous anyway and, in relation to the screams, even if they had been of pain, that was explained by the complainant’s own evidence when she described mr mciver as having sand on his penis, so the nature of the scream did not assist the jury on the consent issue. [34] mr corlett argued that, in assessing nathan mould’s evidence for the purposes of declaring him hostile the judge was entitled to consider his evidence overall and that his evidence-in-chief was much more vague and inconclusive than his statement. for example, he talked of the complainant having “walked off with … brook and troy” and of seeing troy and the complainant “having sex”. these descriptions contrasted sharplywith his statement to the police that the men had been standing around the complainant kissing her and that he “knew something was wrong” from the screams that he heard. [35] whether a witness exhibits an intention to be unhelpful is very much an evaluation for the trial judge. although the judge’s ruling did not contain any r v mould [2015] nzhc 2841 at [8]. comment about nathan mould’s demeanour, it is implicit in his conclusion that the manner in which nathan mould gave his evidence had impressed the judge as appearing to exhibit an intention to be unhelpful to the crown. such a conclusion is consistent with the transcript, which strongly suggests that nathan mould was finding the whole process of giving evidence against his brother very difficult. we are satisfied that the judge’s assessment of the situation and decision to declare nathan mould hostile were correct. this ground of appeal therefore fails. third ground of appeal: refusing permission to adduce evidence of a previous rape complaint mr howells’ evidence [36] counsel for mr mciver called as a witness jac howells, who knew all the defendants either as a friend or an acquaintance. he also knew the complainant. he gave evidence that the complainant initially told him that the sexual activity had been rape but a few days later retracted that and said that she had just been disgusted by having had sex with the men. [37] during cross-examination the prosecutor sought to undermine mr howell’s veracity. she suggested to him that if the complainant were to retract her allegation she would be more likely to do so to her friends b and s, to whom she was closer, than to him. she also suggested that if his account of the complainant retracting the allegation of rape were true, he would have gone to the police with what he knew in order to assist his friends. [38] mr greig cross-examined mr howells on the question of how close a relationship he had with the complainant, eliciting evidence that he had previously had sex with her: q: in fact you went out with [the complainant] didn’t you? a: no. i’ve never been in a relationship with her. q: you weren’t in a relationship with her? a: no i’ve just, i had slept with her you know. application for permission under s 44 to question the witness regarding a previous rape allegation [39] on the basisof mr howells’evidence that hehad slept withthe complainant mr greig sought permission to ask the witness whether the complainant had ever accused him of rape. mr greig was aware that a private investigator had obtained a statement from mr howells that included the following: q: at some stage, hasn’t [the complainant] suggested that you had raped her too? a: yes. she only said it to me, not to others to my knowledge. she’s just a psycho. on the times she has said that to me, she seems to have meant it. we did have a sexual relationship. [40] the questions that mr greig wanted to put to mr howells were: did you ever have a sexual relationship with [the complainant]? was it consensual? did she ever suggest it was otherwise? were you ever worried that she might allege to the police that you had raped her? [41] recognising that such a line of questioning would infringe s 44 of the evidence act, mr greig sought permission from the judge to question mr howells for the purpose of responding to the prosecutor’s suggestion that if the complainant had retracted the rape allegation against the defendants mr howells would have gone to the police; if the complainant had previously accused mr howells of rape he would have a verygood reason for not doing so. [42] section 44 provides that: (1) in a sexual case, no evidence can be given and no question can be put to a witness relating directly or indirectly to the sexual experience of the complainant with any person other than the defendant, except with the permission ofthejudge. (2) in a sexual case, no evidence can be given and no question can be put to a witness that relates directly or indirectly to the reputation of the complainantin sexualmatters. (3) in an application for permission under subsection (1) the judge must not grant permission unless satisfied that the evidence or question is of such direct relevance to facts in issue in the proceeding, or the issue of the appropriate sentence, that it would be contrary to the interests ofjusticeto exclude it. [43] before determining the application the judge proposed a voir dire in which he would put to the witness a single question prefaced by the instruction that he (the witness) could answer fully and honestly regardless of any instructions he had received before giving evidence. thequestion was to be “whydid you not go to the police?” depending on the answer the judge would then confer further with counsel as to the next step. mr greig did not agree with the proposed course. mr hembrow, who was trial counsel for mr mciver and had actually called the witness, did not express a view. [44] a voir dire was conducted. the judge explained to mr howells that, notwithstanding the instructions he had been given not to mention his previous sexual relationship with the complainant, he was free to answer the question the judge was about to put to him. there was the following exchange: q: … why did you not go to the police when as you’ve given evidence already [the complainant] said to you that she had not been raped on that night of, i think it’s the 23rd of may 2014? a: i’m not sure. q: i’m going to ask a supplementary question and it is this; did your decision not to go to the police have a connection with your previous sexual relationship with [the complainant]? a: no. q: i’ll just repeat my first question again and you need to answer this as fully and as truthfully as you can, why did you not go to the police? a: i’m not sure, i never thought about it, i didn’t really see it as a big thing at the time but obviously it is. [45] at the conclusion of the voir dire mr greig renewed his request that he be allowed to question mr howells. the prosecutor opposed the request on the basis that the voir dire had not produced any evidence of a connection between the alleged complaint of rape by the complainant in the context of a relationship with mrhowells and the issue the jurywas considering. [46] the judge refused permission: given the answers to my questions which have come from mr howells i am of the view in this case that given that what i have suggested was really a prelude as i see it to legitimately considering whether getting into issues of [the complainant’s] sexual experience and reputation were appropriate matters here and as i have said given the response from mr howells i am satisfied that issues regarding their sexual relationship are not relevant to the real issue which is at stake here so my ruling is that in terms of s 44 of the evidence act there is to be no questioning of this witness relating to his alleged sexual relationshipwith [the complainant]. appeal [47] mrgreigsubmitted that, given the fact that mr howells had been instructed not to mention the sexual relationship between him and the complainant, the judge’s refusal to allow counsel to cross-examine him was unfair. we do not accept that submission. the judge put an open-ended question to mr howells, having gone to some trouble to ensure that he knew he was not constrained by previous instructions not to mention the sexual relationship between him and the complainant. he repeated the question so as to make absolutely sure the witness understood what he was being asked. [48] in our view, once mr howells answered the judge’s question in the way he did, whether the complainant had previously accused him of rape ceased to have any relevance for the purpose then being advanced, namely to answer the prosecutor’s criticism of his failing to go to the police with information of the complainant’s retraction. [49] before us, however, mr greig proposed a different purpose for the evidence. he submitted that it was relevant to the complainant’s veracity because it showed a previous instance of her regretting consensual sex and later lying about it being consensual. the judge was not asked to consider allowing the evidence to be adduced for this reason. even if consideration had been given to this use of the evidence at the time, however, we are satisfied that permission should not and would not have been given to adduce it. [50] the supreme court recently considered the admissibility of allegedly false prior complaints relied on to challenge a complainant’s veracity in best v r.4 it confirmed that where the defence proposes to call evidence that the complainant has 4 best v r [2016] nzsc 122. previously made a false complaint of a sexual nature both ss 37 and 44 are engaged so that the substantially helpful test under s 37 must be met and permission obtained under s 44 before the allegedly false complaint can be canvassed before the jury.5 [51] the court noted that the potentially relevant factors in the s 37 inquiry may include any remoteness in time, similarity (or lack therefore) between the allegations, the number of allegedly false prior complaints, the reason a complaint did not proceed or was withdrawn, whether the complaint was taken to a person of authorityand whether the prior complaint was fraudulent or malicious.6 on the issue of determining the falsity of the allegation, the court said: [74] in line with the policy behind s 37 (including that behind the old collateral evidence rule), the substantial helpfulness of a previous allegedly false complaint will also depend on how clear it is that the previous complaint is false, how much evidence would need to be canvassed to decide whether the complaint is false and the likely outcome of the assessment of that evidence. the more evidence that would need to be called on the unrelated prior allegation and thus the extent of any ‘trial within a trial’ and the more uncertain the outcome of the deliberations on that evidence, the less likely the evidence is to be substantially helpfulin terms of s 37. [52] thesupreme court then summarised the approach to be taken: [75] aruling on whether evidence ofa prior allegedlyfalse complaintis substantially helpful under s 37 will usually be required before it can be raised in evidence. [76] where s 44 is potentially engaged, the judge’s permission will always be required and there must be some evidential foundation that the prior complaint was in fact false before it can even be raised before the judge. if there is such an evidential foundation, the complainant should be asked (in the absence of the jury) to confirm whether or not the prior complaint was false. there would be no further examination and no cross-examination unless and until the judge has made a ruling on ss 37 and 44. [77] the judge will need to consider whether the evidence of the prior allegedly false complaint is substantially helpful under s 37 in the particular circumstances of the case. this will include consideration of all relevant factors, including the policy behind the old collateral evidence rule. the more evidence that would need to be called on the unrelated prior allegation and the more uncertain the outcome of the deliberations on that evidence, the less likely the evidence is to be substantially helpful to assessing a person’s veracity. 5 best v r, above n4, at [71]. 6 at [73]. [78] if the substantially helpfulness test under s 37 is met, there will need to be a separate assessment of whether it would be contrary to the interests of justice to exclude the evidence. even if that test is met s 44 (if it applies) may well limit the way the evidence is led so that the concentration is on the falsehood ofthe complaint and not the prior sexual experience. (footnotes omitted) [53] in the present case mrhowells’assertion of previousfalse complaints bythe complainant clearly engaged both ss 37 and 44. but even if the complainant were to admit making some or all of the allegedly false complaints (in his statement to the private investigator mr howells used the plural but did not specify how many) the circumstances mr howells described were so different from the charges being considered that the evidence would not have been substantially helpful. mr howells described complaints made only to him in the context of sexual activity only between him and the complainant, who were both 16 at the time. the circumstances were entirely different from the assertion of non-consensual sex between the complaint and a group of older men (the appellants were both 19 at the time) that resulted in complaints being made to the complainant’s friends and family and to the police. alternatively, if the complainant denied making the complaints at all or denied that it they were false, the need for the jury to first determine those questions would significantly detract from any assistance to be had from the evidence. [54] this ground of appeal fails. fourth ground of appeal: evidence that isaac mould wore an ankle bracelet [55] when the complainant’s mother gave evidence she was asked about whether she knew mr mould. in answering, she referred to the fact that he had been wearing an ankle bracelet. the evidence was this: q: and just going back to the mould boys who lived down the road, how long had you known nathan mould as at the beginning of last year? a: probably since the beginning of 2013. q: and what abouthis older brother isaac? a: umi didn’t know him well, he was wearing an ankle bracelet. [56] the words “he was wearing an ankle bracelet” do not, however, appear in the transcript. at mr greig’s suggestion and with the agreement of all counsel and the judge they were removed in the hope that the jury would not have understood the significance of the evidence and would not find it in the transcript in the event that they reread the passage. [57] mr greig submitted that the evidence nevertheless prejudiced mr mould because it conveyed that mr mould was either serving an electronically-monitored sentence or was on electronically-monitored bail. he argued that it is not open to counsel to consent to his or her client being prejudiced. mr greig added that, given the judge’s refusal to declare a mistrial following the complainant’s evidence about mr mould having raped b, there was little prospect of a mistrial being granted as a result of this evidence and no point in making an application. [58] in edmonds v r this court referred to the well settled legal principles that apply where there has been inadvertent disclosure of prejudicial information about an accused during the trial; the trial judge has a discretion to discharge the jury but whether it is proper to do so depends on the facts of the particular case.7 the court went on to note that inadvertent disclosure of the imprisonment of a defendant is not of itself sufficient reason to conclude that there might have been a miscarriage of justice.8 [59] in this case we are satisfied that the evidence did not cause any or unfair prejudice. the evidence was fleeting, was not referred to again by any counsel, and was deleted from the record. these steps, coupled with the usual direction during summing up regarding unfair prejudice would have been an effective counter to any risk of the jury drawing an adverse inference as to mr mould’s background. 7 edmonds v r [2015] nzca152 at [23], citing r v mclean (colin) [2001] 3 nzlr 794 (ca) at [14]. 8 edmonds v r at [24]. result [60] none of the grounds of appeal have merit. both appeals against conviction are dismissed. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent

[4] in my judgment of 7 july 2016, i said ms lister would need to take up, separately, any issue of the second respondent receiving rental income for her father’s property during his lifetime.2 but argument over costs in this case is not the time or place to do that. i suggest the respondents respond to ms lister’s concerns to her directly.

[2] the issue is do i give you community detention? i understand (and i could have this totally wrong though) that you intend to leave otago, which has this drinking culture, and do your studies in either auckland or waikato. that is a decision for you but that causes difficulties about community detention and having any ability to control or have input into how you are going with treatment programmes and plan. somewhat against what i would normally do in the circumstances that confront me here, i am going to deal with you by the imposition of community work. it will be a large amount of community work but i temper that also with making a large emotional harm reparation payment to ms kane (policewoman kane) because i consider that you can spend your summer working to get the emotional harm reparation together so that she has some refund of the emotional trauma and the rocky road she has been through over the past 18 months. [3] on the charge of assault with intent to obstruct, you are sentenced to 300 hours’ community work. you will pay emotional harm reparation of $5000. you will pay that by 31 december this year. [4] on the charge of assaulting mr ogilvie, mr ogilvie is a very honest man. he said in his victim impact statement that he had not suffered emotional trauma. i cannot award him emotional harm reparation. you are sentenced to 100 hours’ community work to be done concurrently. [5] on the intentional damage, you have paid the reparation i am told. you are sentenced to 60 hours’ community work; to be dealt with concurrently. [6] on the resisting constable early, you are sentenced to 60 hours’ community work; to be served concurrently. k j phillips district court judge

[2] the companies are in the hands of the liquidator at the moment and a plea of not guilty was initially entered. the liquidators are not wishing to have pleas of guilty formally entered. this then is set down as a formal proof and the liquidators are represented by mrs ford, the informant by ms blythe. [3] i have read the memorandum regarding the issues for trial. as i have indicated, the companies face multiple charges under the customs and excise act and the representatives of the company, ms joblin and mr clegg, have also been charged personally, pleaded guilty and have been fined for their role in the offending. the prosecutor relies on the formal written statements of witnesses, pursuant to s 18 evidence act 2006 and i accept the written statements accordingly. [4] the evidence relied upon is attached at tab 4 of the submissions, relating to erroneous entries in relation to clothing imported from china by the defendant companies and another company by the name of minti design limited between december 2010 and february 2014. ms joblin and mr clegg, to whom i have already referred, were directors of all four companies. [5] an analysis of the individual charges and the maximum penalties attaching to each have been referred to under tab 4, together with the draft summary of facts. it is a lengthy document and i do not intend to read it in its entirety other than to note that, as a result of the investigation, customs have identified 114 erroneous import entries submitted and two imports that had no entries lodged as the invoices were undervalued. the imports were undervalued by $2,830,394.59 and as a result the total revenue evasion by the companies is $680,120.48. [6] i have read mr thompson’s formal statement which forms the basis of the evidence upon which the informant relies and i accept his statement and analysis as being correct and reliable. [7] in all the circumstances then and having regard to the other statements lodged, i am satisfied that the charges have been made out by way of formal proof and the companies are convicted accordingly. [8] now this will need to be adjourned for sentencing on the basis that there are still outstanding issues concerning possible forfeiture applications and other matters to be tidied up. it seems to me that that could be done by any judge, given that liability has been established and the only issue now outstanding is one of penalty. however, that remains to be seen. c j field district court judge

[2] counsel for the council has filed a memorandum to confirm that costs on a 2b basis amount to $12,822.50 but that the council’s lawyers charge-out rate applied to the estimated time spent preparing for the appeal of 40 hours results in sum of $7,080.00. that is the sum the council seeks byway of costs award. [3] high court rule 14.2(f) provides: an award of costs should not exceed the costs incurred by the party claiming costs. [4] the fact the council was represented by in-house counsel does not prevent it from recovering its costs. in henderson borough council v auckland regional authority cook j noted:2 [t]he fact that an employed practitioner has acted for the successful party is not a sufficient reason for denying that party an award of party and party costs: after all, the time of a salaried employee has been occupied. [5] while that case was decided before the new costs regime, cases decided under the part 14 of the high court rules apply the same principle.3 [6] the sum of costs sought by the council of $7,080.00 is approved. the registrar may seal the costs order in that sum. venning j 1 bright v auckland council [2016] nzhc 1560. 2 henderson borough council v auckland regional authority [1984] 1 nzlr 16 (ca) at 23. 3 inland revenue v harbour city tow and salvage (2003) limited hc wellington civ-2006-485­ 2002,12 february2007; and grant v pandey [2013] nzhc 3323.

[2] on 28 june, i heard the application and declined to grant the stay. she then applied for leave to appeal the stay decision to the court of appeal. i heard the application on 24 august. an interlocutory decision made by the high court on appeal from a district court decision is an original decision, and accordingly, is appealable as of right. 1 accordingly, the high court's leave is not required, and must be declined accordingly. [3] one other point to note is that in my earlier judgment, i found that the merits of the substantive appeal were slim because no question of law was disclosed. siemer v heron [201 l] nzsc 133, [2012] nzlr 309 at [31] and [34]. franicevic v kgh trust [2016] nzhc 2075 [2 september 2016] incorrectly stated that there is no right of cross-examination in the tenancy tribunal. as it transpires, s 93 of the residential tenancies act 1993 does provide such a right. however, ms franicevic did not ask to cross-examine in the tribunal. accordingly, this does not change my earlier analysis that the merits of the appeal are slim, and that, accordingly, the merits of the stay application are not strong. and none of the other grounds raises a question of law. _ji lvi_---.(_ williams j

[5] the liquidators have now filed a very prompt report confirming that the plaintiff has been placed in liquidation and that they have disclaimed the plaintiff’s claim in the proceeding as onerous property under s 269 of the companies act 1993. the liquidators also advised that the defendant has filed a creditors’ claim in the liquidation and that claim would be considered and assessed in due course. [6] in the circumstances described by the liquidators, it is clear that the proceeding will not be amended, nor will it proceed to trial. [7] i consider the only appropriate course is to dismiss the proceeding and order accordingly.

[4] in terms of amenity effects, this still compares favourably with the trading hours originally proposed, of 6.30am to 6.00pm. [5] when this error was drawn to our attention, the members of the court conferred and agreed that the longer hours actually proposed in mr bartlett's memorandum do not change our views on the consentability of the proposal and we would be content to grant consent on that basis, particularly given that the outdoor seating part of the proposal, which seemed to be of particular concern, was no longer sought.

[2] the decision that mr marsh wants special leave to appeal is a decision of mander j in the high court at christchurch.1 in that decision mander j declined mrmarsh leave to bring a high court appeal against a substantive decision of judge barber in the wellington district court under s 162 of the accident compensation act 2001.2 1 marsh v accident compensation corporation [2015] nzhc 3208. 2 marsh v accident compensation corporation [2012] nzacc 115. marsh vaccidentcompensation corp[2016] nzca409[26august 2016] [3] it is well established that this court has no jurisdiction under s 163 of the accident compensation act to hear an appeal against a high court decision declining leave to appeal to that court.3 [4] this court having no jurisdiction, the registrar was correct to refuse to accept mr marsh’s application for filing. i therefore uphold the registrar’s decision. mccafferty v accident compensation corporation [2004] nzar 97 (ca) at [7]–[8]; howard v accident compensation corporation [2014] nzsc31, (2014) 21prnz815 at [7].
in the district court at napier cri-2014-041-002172 [2016] nzdc 16602 the queen v robert donald waikato hearing: 26 august 2016 appearances: j rielly for the crown s jefferson for the defendant judgment: 26 august 2016 notes of judge g a rea on sentencing [1] mr waikato, you are finally here for sentence today on nine burglaries and two driving charges. [2] the burglaries involved losses of over $50,000 and they come at a time when you as a mature man have ample previous convictions for the same thing. the reason why the matter has taken so long to get dealt with is because of your health issues. you have a disease that has caused major difficulties for you and the sentencing was originally put off for some months after your plea because of that. [3] however, the time has come where the court simply has to impose a sentence at this stage. it may well be that as a result of this sentence you are able to make application to the parole board under the parole act 2002 for compassionate release or for some other consideration but that will be a matter for you, mr jefferson and the parole board. [4] i do not consider it is necessary to go through all of the details of the charges. originally judge adeane gave a sentence indication of a starting point of six years’ imprisonment. the crown accept that because you have not been convicted of all of the charges included in that sentence indication a reduced starting point can be arrived at. [5] accordingly in relation to each of these charges when looked at in their entirety, i think the appropriate starting point is one of five years’ imprisonment. there does need to be an uplift to reflect the fact that you have multiple previous similar convictions and that is set at six months. i consider that that five year and six months as a starting point needs to be reduced down to four years to reflect your current health situation and the difficulty that serving any sentence would represent for you. [6] you are entitled to a discount of 15 percent in relation to your late pleas of guilty and therefore on the burglary charges you are sentenced to three years and three months’ imprisonment on each charge. the terms are concurrent, running together, making a total of three years and three months. [7] on the failing to stop you are convicted and discharged. on the driving while suspended you are sentenced to one months’ imprisonment. the terms of imprisonment are concurrent, running together, making a total of three years and three months. you are disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver’s licence for a period of one year and that starts today. [8] for completeness, so that anybody looking at this at a later time understands the basis upon which you were sentenced, i direct that the comprehensive summary of facts be annexed to these sentencing notes. it is not necessary in my view at this stage for me to go through them in any more detail. g a rea district court judge

[2] one charge is under the harmful digital communications act 2015. i was originally perplexed by the summary of facts in terms of the dates but it now seems clear that on 9 june or around 9 june this year you contacted a facebook group which is a site that posts anonymous facebook posts. you then requested that a harmful facebook post directed at the victim be published on the site. that happened. [3] themessages areattached to the summaryoffacts. ialso haveavictimimpact statement and,unsurprisingly, the victimwas pretty upset bywhat you did. iimagine that was the whole purpose behind your actions. [4] you have no previous convictions that are similar. [vijayjosh] [2017] nzdc 15206 [8 june 2017] [5] then on 15 july 2016, at a time when you were already on bail on the earlier charge, you breached a protection order by telephoning the same victim. [6] i have apre-sentence report that was prepared on an earlier occasion. it refers to the fact that you are due to commence a programme which arises because of the protection order. thereport identifies that you have issues with gamblingand alcohol use. [7] in the end i have decided to deal with your offending by way of sentences of community work. i would have imposed a sentence of reparation for the emotional harm that you undoubtedlycaused the victim but i think the fact that you alreadyowe over $14,000 in fines probably makes that inappropriate in the circumstances. [8] fines are something that you will need to deal with and you can deal with that on another occasion. i have not got to the bottom of precisely what hours of community work you might have done and in respect of what fines. i therefore put that to one side.

[2] the appeal itself is against a decision of gendall j in the high court declining to award mr mcguire costs in a judicial review proceeding mr mcguire mcguire v manawatu standards committee [2016] nzca364 [28 july2016] had brought against the respondents.1 mr mcguire was successful in the judicial review proceeding and intends to argue on appeal that costs should have followed the event. [3] mr mcguire submits that in declining to waive payment of the filing fee for the appeal, the registrar has effectively contradicted and/or reinterpreted gendall j’s decision. this is said to be because gendall j found the proceeding involved a matter of public interest whereas the registrar says it does not. [4] i do not accept that submission. justice gendall’s reference to the public interest was in the context of a finding that the respondents had acted in the public interest.2 that was one of the reasons the judge gave for declining to award costs against them. there is no inconsistency between the judge’s ruling and the undoubtedly correct finding by the registrar that mr mcguire’s appeal does not involve a matter of general public importance or genuine public interest. the principles relating to the awarding of costs against entities exercising statutory functions are well established. [5] mr mcguire does not advanceany otherground of review.

[2] on the first point, the grant of leave is in respect of the question whether the doctrines of issue estoppel and/or abuse of process operate to prevent dr muir from pursuing the sub-pt eh argument for the 1999 and subsequent tax years. in respect of issue estoppel, we ask that the parties address the general application of the doctrine in the tax context as well as its application in this particular case (assuming its general application). [3] we will hear the appeal on a date convenient to counsel in the week beginning 22 august 2016. one day should be sufficient. to facilitate a hearing in that week, dr muir is to file and serve his submissions by 5 pm on thursday 4 august 2016 and the respondent is to file and serve her submissions by 5pm on thursday 18 august 2016.

[2] the deceased died on 17 march 2016. he left a will dated 10 april 2010. this will appointed his wife as executor and trustee and left his entire estate to her. on or about 1 january 2013 the deceased and his wife separated. on or about 19 june 2014 the deceased and his wife entered into a separation agreement settling all matters relating to their property. on or about 26 june 2014 the deceased instructed his lawyer at the time to prepare a new will which would divide his estate equally to the deceased's three children.

[4] the deceased's wife says that she and the deceased had various conversations in the months prior to his death. he confirmed to her that he intended to divide his estate equally amongst his three children. despite enquiries, no signed will after 10 april 2010 has been found.

[6] i am satisfied on the evidence, in accordance withs 14 of the wills act 2007, that the draft will is a document which appears to be a will, it does not comply with the requirements of s 11 of the act, and it expresses the deceased's testamentary intentions at the time of the instructions and in the months preceding his death. accordingly i make an order validating the 2014 draft will of the deceased, a copy of which is annexed to the affidavit of diane mcdonald and marked with t letter "f". ~

[2] in the first decision chief judge colgan found that mr saad had constructively dismissed the respondent, mr mcivor, and ordered mr saad to pay saad v mcivor [2016] nzca 314 [7 july 2016] loss of remuneration, compensation and a penalty.1 in the second decision the judge awarded costs in favour of mr mcivor in relation to both the employment court proceeding and an earlier proceeding in the employment relations authority.2 [3] the applications for leave to appeal in respect of both decisions were filed out of time, requiring applications for an extension of time.3 [4] the period of delay in filing the respective applications for leave was not significant and we accept there was some confusion about the time limits. mr saad is self-represented. [5] however, the applications suffer from a more fundamental defect and that is that none of the proposed grounds of appeal satisfies the prerequisites for granting leave under s 214. none raises questions of law and none raises questions of general or public importance. all the proposed grounds are very much case-specific. they relate to factual findings and the chief judge’s analysis of the evidence. [6] it follows that, even if the applications for leave had been filed in time, they would not have any prospect of success. [7] the applications for an extension of time are accordingly declined. 1 mcivor v saad [2015] nzempc 145. 2 mcivor v saad [2015] nzempc 174. 3 court of appeal (civil) rules 2005, r 29a.

[2016) nzenvc 2.cs of ah appeal under section 358 of the resource management act 1991 (the act) sailors rest trust (env-2015-akl-000058) appellant thames -coromandel district council respondent court: environment judge m harland environment commissioner ace leijnen date of decision: 7 july 2016 final decision of the environment court a. the appeal is allowed in part as outlined in the courts interim decision of 23 may 2016. 8. sailors rest trust is required to pay costs and charges amounting to $26,615.15 to the thames -coromandel district council. there will be no order of costs on the appeal. 2 reasons for decision [1] on 23 may 2016 we issued an interim decision1 in respect of an appeal by sailors rest trust ("the trust'') against a decision by an independent commissioner dismissing the trusts objection to pay charges and costs amounting to $35,285.60 to the thames-coromandel district council ("the council"). we allowed the appeal in part and determined that the trust should pay $26,615.15 to the council. in our decision we recorded in paragraphs [56]-[58] that we had discovered certain discrepancies in the invoices charged by the council to the trust which we took into account in reaching the sum of $26, 615.15. because neither the council nor the trust had had an opportunity to address them, we allowed 10 working days for the council to respond to these matters, with a right of reply by the trust 5 working days thereafter. it is important to note that the extent of comment sought was limited to the discrepancies we had discovered. [2] we have since received a memorandum from the council dated 7 june 2016 and two emails from mr wern ham on behalf of the trust dated 10 and 13 june 2016. [3) the council has accepted that our understanding of the discrepancies is correct, with the result that there should be no adjustment to the sum of $26,615.15 outlined in the interim decision. unfortunately mr wernham's response dealt with matters beyond the scope of the courts enquiry and raised matters which have been already determined by us in our interim decision, but in making this comment we intend no criticism of mr wernham who was probably unaware that the trust's reply was limited in this way. [4] we thank the parties for their response and confirm our interim decision. signed at auckland this =,.~ day of ~l_j 2016 for the court: m harland environment judge

[3] on review, counsel for mr mcclintock submits the registrar erred in two key respects: first, failing to take into account the future costs of this litigation and its effect on mr mcclintock’s limited funds and, secondly, failing to appreciate the public interest in the case. [4] the appeal itself was an appeal against the decision of a high court judge striking out mr mcclintock’s statement of claim in the high court.1 the appeal was given an urgent hearing and determined in mr mcclintock’s favour.2 significantly for present purposes, however, this court declined to award mr mcclintock any costs because of what was described as his “disentitling conduct in the high court”.3 this related to “continual delays and unexplained breaches of orders”, which is what had prompted the high court judge to strike out the statement of claim in the first place.4 [5] in those circumstances, i agree with the registrar’s view that a distinction can properly be made between the substantive high court proceeding, which may involve public interest, and the appeal, which plainly did not. further, in my view, the registrar was not required to take into account future and as yet unascertained liabilities. [6] it follows that i consider the registrar’s decision was correct. the application for review is declined. the setting down fee of $2,700 must be paid immediately. solicitors: warren simpson, papakura for appellant crown law office, wellington for first respondent heaney & partners, auckland for second respondent 1 mcclintock v attorney-general hc auckland civ-2015-404-279, 19 april 2016. 2 mcclintock v attorney-general [2016] nzca 274. 3 at [19]. 4 at [12].

[3] on review, ms white and ms freeman do not dispute there has been a failure to comply with the requirements of r 43. however, they contend it is the court’s fault. they submit they would have filed their application for a suspension of adjudication in february 2016 had the court not advised them such an application should be filed in the high court. [4] however, that does not explain the reason for non-compliance with the requirements of r 43, which relate to preparation of the case on appeal and the obtaining of a fixture. [5] in any event, the rules are very clear. at the time ms white and ms freeman purported to file their suspension application, the appeal no longer existed for that purpose. it was abandoned. [6] the appropriate course of action is for ms white and ms freeman to revive the appeal by obtaining an extension of time under r 43(3). i note they have in fact filed an application for such an order, which has yet to be determined. issues relating to the reasons for the delay can properly be addressed in that context. [7] it follows i agree the registrar was correct to refuse to accept the document for filing and his decision is confirmed.

[2] mr lau does not suggest that he is personally affected by the order. he says he is acting as an agent for dongfeng lin, who has filed a caveat over a property said to beaffected bytheorder. theowner ofthatpropertyis liansen mao. mrlau did not explain the nature of this agency in the court ofappeal and has not done so 1 lau v umh group ltd [2016]nzca132 (stevens, cooper andwinkelmannjj) [umh (ca)]. 2 umh group ltd hcauckland civ-2015-404-1993,13 october 2015. augustine lau v umh grouplimited [2016] nzsc 82 [5 july2016] in this court either, despite the reservations expressed by the court of appeal about the unexplained nature of the agency.3 [3] the order made by gilbert j was made on 13 october 2015. there was no opposition from any of the affected parties who had been served notice of the application and provided with a timetable within which to file a notice of opposition. mrmao sought to oppose the order after it was made and mr lau unsuccessfully sought a recall of the order by gilbert j. some time later the order was served on mrmao. mrlau then applied forthe extension oftime to appeal to thecourt of appeal, arguing that the delay in serving the order on mr mao was the cause of his delay in appealing. as mentioned earlier, there was no explanation why mr lau was the proposed appellant, not mr mao or ms lin. [4] the court of appeal considered the intended appeal to that court could not succeed.4 in those circumstances an extension of time to appeal was not warranted. [5] the proposed appeal to this court does not give rise to any point of public importance. nor does it give any basis for concern that a miscarriage of justice may occur if leave is not given. the test for the grant of leave to appeal to this court is not met.5 [6] we therefore dismiss the application.

[2] counsel for the appellant does not challenge the quantum of the costs claimed, but submits that costs should not be settled at this point pending a decision of the supreme court on an application for leave to appeal a decision of miller j. millerj declined an application to review the registrar’s decision on the appellant’s application for dispensation from the requirement to pay security for costs. sax v simpson[2016] nzca303[4 july2016] [3] i do not regard the outstanding application for leave to appeal in the supreme court as a basis for not fixing costs at this stage. questions might arise as to whether any costs award should be stayed pending the outcome of the supreme court proceeding, if leave to appeal is granted. in the meantime, however, fixing costs will be in accordance with r 53a(g) of the rules that so far as possible, the determination of costs should be expeditious.

[3] counsel for the second respondents continues to seek an order removing the second respondents as a party. by direction of the high court made on 13 june 2016 this is to be determined on the papers. 1 [4] i am satisfied the second respondents (whether as named in the original statement of claim or the second amended statement of claim) should be removed as a named party to mr creser 's proceeding and i so order. this is because, insofar as the proceeding is concerned with reviewing the first respondent's decision, they are not a necessary party2 and, insofar as mr creser seeks to challenge the supreme court's actions in respect of the court record, the matter is not reviewable by this court.3 [5] the proceeding is to be listed in the judge's chambers list on 11 july 2016.

[3] i have by a slim margin granted bail today on the basis that there is an address available to mr josh in [suburb deleted]. that is some very considerable distance from [location deleted]. that will be on the condition that he lives at [address deleted] which is his aunty’s address. he is not to contact directly or indirectly in any fashion whatsoever, the named complainant unless in the family court, and he is not to travel north of the waimakariri river. [4] i am satisfied given the lack of violence in mr josh’s history along with the requirements contained in s 8 bail act 2000 that apply to him, that these terms of bail will contain any risk. i have also borne in mind the seriousness of the charge which has been laid. there is a maximum penalty associated with that of only two years’ imprisonment and the likely time before this matter would come to trial in the event that a not guilty plea would be entered. [5] so in the circumstances you will be granted bail - do not breach it - because as you can, tell this is by a fine margin. do you understand? [yes sir.

[2] on 11 november 2013 mr cronin contacted an officer of the public trust with whom he had past dealings. he requested the officer, mr alan timu, to visit him in christchurch hospital in order to take new will instructions. mr cronin indicated he was in hospital pending further assessment and a move to a rest home. [3] mr timu deposes that mr cronin was sitting up and alert. the new will instructions differed from the existing will because since that will his wife had died, and he had drifted out of contact with the other specific beneficiaries. he now wished to leave his estate to a friend. [4] mr timu took the instructions and returned to the public trust. he entered the instructions into the public trust's computer system by completing the electronic questionnaire. mr timu was not at work the next day, but returned the following estate of ip cronin [2016] nzhc 1321 [17 june 2016] day only to learn that mr cronin had passed away in the night following mr timu's visit.

[7] i am satisfied the will instructions entered by mr timu on 11 november 2013 and now appearing in the form of the public trust questionnaire for will represent the testamentary intentions of mr cronin, and i declare the questionnaire to be a valid will.

[2] before that date, counsel for the judgment creditor had filed a memorandum explaining a potential confusion in relation to the judgment debtor’s name. in the district court judgment on which the bankruptcy notice had been based, the debtor’s given names had been transposed, a feature which carried through into his name in the bankruptcy notice. by the time the adjudication application was issued, counsel for the commissioner had identified the transposition and in the documents filed from the application for adjudication order onwards, the debtor’s names appeared in the correct order. [3] accordingly, when the court adjudicated the judgment debtor bankrupt, it was pursuant to the application for adjudication and the formal order should correctly record the debtor as “andrew richard bate”. [4] technically, there remains a defect in the proceeding in that the bankruptcy notice rendered the debtor’s given names in the reverse order. [5] for the purpose of remedying the defect on the court file, i recall the judgment dated 31 may 2016. [6] i order that the defect in the bankruptcy notice whereby the judgment debtor (andrew richard bate) is identified as “richard andrew bate” is corrected so that the bankruptcy notice shall be treated as having read “andrew richard bate”. i dispense with amendment and re-service of the notice. [7] save to the extent of that order, the order made on 31 may 2016 stands as it was made, with the debtor’s adjudication timed at 10.20 am on 31 may 2016. associate judge smith solicitors: inland revenue department, legal and technical services, wellington

[4] the other medical centre provided the records at the disclosure hearing. having inspected the records we were satisfied that they did not contain any details of any mental health condition or disorder and therefore provided no elaboration of the disability or disorder described in an unrelated claim the complainant has brought against her employer in australia and which led to the disclosure application.3 we therefore advised counsel at the disclosure hearing that the application for disclosure is formally declined. these records were returned to the practice manager who attended the hearing. [5] counsel forthe appellant intends to makefurther enquiries in australia. itis envisaged that the appeal against conviction will only be pursued if those enquiries uncover materially relevant information. counsel for the appellant will file a memorandum setting out the steps he proposes to take and the timeframe for those steps so that a time for the appeal, if it is to proceed, can be scheduled. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent 1 the backgroundtothisapplicationisset out at: sv r ca539/2014, 5 february2016 (minute). 2 sv r ca539/2014, 15 march 2016 (minute). 3 thisclaimisdiscussedinfurtherdetail inthe 5februaryminute,above n1.

[2] by minute of o’regan j of 16 may 2016, the court said that it intended to treat the memorandum of 10 may 2016 as an application to recall the judgment. the respondent was given the opportunity to file submissions on the application and it was indicated that the court would deal with the matter on the papers. [3] the appellants interpret the words “from the date of settlement by the chicks of the purchase of the farm” as referring to the date the purchase would have been settled but for the high court proceedings: 30 april 2010. they submit that this conclusion follows from the context of the judgment as a whole and in particular [84]–[85] of the judgment. it also follows from the fact that they did not receive the judgment sum of $1m on 30 april 2010 as they would have done in the absence of the respondent’s negligence. [4] the respondent interprets the words “from the date of settlement” as referring to the date on which settlement of the transaction was formally completed. it is submitted on behalf of the respondent that paragraph [87] of the judgment is clear and unambiguous. there is therefore no reason to recall the judgment. [5] we accept therespondent’s submission. the wording of the judgment is clear and it has the meaning the respondent contends. we comment that the appellants retained ownership of the farm until the transaction was actually settled and that, as the respondent points out, no submissions on interest were made at the hearing of the appeal. [6] for the above reasons the application for recall is dismissed. costs of $1,000 are awarded to the respondent. solicitors: brent kelly &associates, te awamutu forappellants morrison kent, wellington for respondent

[2] he subsequently issued proceedings in which he claimed that the police officers involved in his arrest and subsequent detention had breached his rights under the new zealand bill of rights act 1990 in various respects, including what he alleged to be torture and cruel treatment, and he alleged the police were guilty of misfeasance in public office. following a trial at which the applicant and the police jesse waiariki temanavabutler vnorth shore police [2016] nzsc 63[13 june 2016] officers who had dealt with him gave evidence, asher j dismissed the applicant’s claims.1 [3] theapplicant’s noticeofappeal to the court ofappeal was filed out oftime.2 the reason for the delay was that he had, initially, mistakenly attempted to file an appeal in the high court at auckland. the respondent did not suggest that the resulting delay had caused it any prejudice. while recognising these considerations, the court of appeal refused to extend time for the appeal as it considered that the appeal was not arguable.3 [4] many of the arguments advanced by the applicant in his submissions in support of his leave application are at best only tangentially related to the events in issue and, to the limited extent to which he did focus on those events, he advanced nothing which would suggest that the court ofappeal’s appreciation of the merits of his proposed appeal was erroneous. we see no question of public or general importance in the appeal and no appearance of a miscarriage of justice. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent 1 butler v massey university albany [2015] nzhc 2287. 2 butler v north shore police [2016] nzca150 (harrison,wild and kós jj). 3 at [10]–[11].

[2] at 9.30am on 31 may 2016 i spoke with both counsel by telephone. ms brabant advised that the defendant company had provided additional material which indicated that it was not in a financial position to meet a fine. she asked for a short time to finally consider all of the material before a final decision was made. [3] on 1 june 2016 i received a memorandum from ms brabant confirming that the informant accepts that the defendant is not in a position to pay a fine given its current financial position. accordingly since it is accepted that the defendant cannot meet a fine in addition to the reparation already ordered it is not possible to impose a fine on it and therefore the matter will be dealt with solely by the reparation orders already made. [4] ms brabant has asked me to undertake an analysis and arrive at what the fine would have been in accordance with the principles in hanham & philp and make a declaration as to the starting point in terms of culpability and what the end fine would have been if the company was in a position to pay it. [5] the position, as confirmed by ms brabant, is that the defendant is not in a position where a fine can be imposed upon it in addition to reparation. while during the course of the teleconference on 31 may 2016 i indicated i was prepared to accede to ms brabant’s request and declare what the fine would have been if one could have been imposed i have reflected upon that and i do not believe that it is appropriate to do so. on the facts of this case it is accepted that the defendant cannot pay any fine at all. for me to arrive at a hypothetic figure totally unrelated to the facts of the case before me is not part of my function and in my view would not be appropriate. [6] to arrive at what an appropriate fine might have been there may well be issues other than the ability to pay that would be taken into account and although i have written submissions from counsel those submissions would have to be in the context of what the real position was and not in a situation such as this. in cases such as this there cannot really be any precedent value in a one-off district court decision as to penalty and that is certainly the case if the matter was only dealt with hypothetically. accordingly for the reasons i have given i am not prepared to state what the fine would have been in other circumstances and i therefore decline to deal with the matter in that way. g a rea district court judge

in the district court at gisborne cri-2014-082-000389 [2016] nzdc 9458 new zealand police prosecutor v heremia hakopa defendant hearing: 26 may 2016 appearances: sergeant c neustroski for the prosecutor a p dreifuss for the defendant judgment: 26 may 2016 notes of judge a j adeane on sentencing [1] mr hakopa has been convicted by a jury on one count of unlawful sexual connection with a child. the circumstances are that he, at 24 years of age, was in the position of trust and influence over a girl aged between five and six years. this offending took place back in the period 1996 to 1997. [2] on one occasion when the child was in the bedroom, the defendant lifted her up and placed his mouth on her vagina, thereby committing an act of sexual violation by unlawful sexual connection. [3] obviously the aggravating features are the position of trust and the age of the young victim. the child of course was completely vulnerable to this sort of behaviour and the defendant simply took advantage of that. [4] the case is made the more troubling because mr hakopa does not accept the verdict of the jury and continues to maintain simply that he is innocent of this offending. the jury verdict however is conclusive insofar as this court is concerned. [5] the guideline case is r v a m [2010] nzca 114; 2 nzlr 750 which sets out a series of categories of offending. in my view this matter is capable of being categorised in band 1 of sexual violation, but only just because of the age and vulnerability of the child. [6] the defendant’s personal circumstances are set out in the probation report. otherwise they are unexceptional; he is a contributing member of the community, but this conviction demonstrates a significant flaw in his character. [7] there is a submission that he should receive a youth discount for the fact that he was 24 years of age at the time of the offending. given the age difference between he and the victim, in my view, and the nature of the offending itself, a discount for youth in those circumstances would be quite inappropriate and i decline to make one. [8] i adopt a starting point of three years’ imprisonment. there is only one matter for which a discount might be entertained and that is the absence of previous convictions. that however, has to be seen in the context of an ongoing refusal to accept the jury’s verdict in this matter, or to acknowledge guilt. that of course is never an aggravating feature, but it may be a feature that bears on the appropriateness of discounts. [9] in the circumstances, in my view, a discount of 10 percent is quite adequate to recognise the previous absence of convictions and accordingly, mr hakopa is sentenced for this to 32 months’ imprisonment. a j adeane district court judge

[3] a document purporting to do that was filed by mr hill on 15 may 2016. from the terms of mr hill's memorandum it is very difficult to discern any relevant grounds for opposition to the costs sought. for instance, the first paragraph of his memorandum states: the appellant states that the comt has through neglect ruled that the estate it is purporting to charge against for costs incurred by new zealand law society member the maori trustee and agent ms c reuhman cannot be identified by registration or free and intelligent consent in the proceeding. [4] this is very clearly a proceeding in which the usual rule that costs should follow the event is appropriately applied. the maori trustee has calculated the scale costs on a 2b basis at $8,288. however, the memorandum filed on behalf of the maori trustee dated 24 april 2016 seeks increased costs on the basis that responding appropriately to mr hill's various initiatives in the proceeding required a more than usual level of resources. for instance, there were six case management conferences and an additional three memoranda filed in respect of them. [5] having reviewed the history of the proceedings, in light of the district comi judgment and my own, i am satisfied that materially more than a usual level of resources were appropriately required from the maori trustee to deal with steps that appear to have included diversionary and delaying tactics by mr hill. ultimately, many of the points he sought to raise were completely untenable. [6] the maori trustee has sought an uplift of 50 per cent. i consider that is justified. i accordingly order costs in favour of the maori trustee in the sum of $12,432. dobson j solicitors: maori trustee, wellington copy to: f pk hill

[2] i can understand dr finucane’s concern, because judge neave has apparently indicated that he would prefer the expert witnesses in the christchurch proceeding to be present at court when the lay witnesses give evidence. dr finucane is not, however, summonsed to attend the christchurch hearing, and i consider he can adequately discharge his responsibilities to the court by reading a transcript of the evidence given at that hearing on 23 may 2016. it is anticipated that dr finucane will be able to complete his evidence in auckland by early afternoon on 23 may, and will then be able to travel to christchurch to meet his obligations in respect of the christchurch hearing. [3] i consider that dr finucane’s obligation to attend the family court in auckland on 23 may 2016 has priority. for that reason i am not prepared to set the witness summons in respect of that hearing aside.

[3] the christchurch city council filed its evidence and an application for waiver on 9 may 2016, which is ten days out from the time limit imposed by the court. while a reason for the delay is not provided, the christchurch city council explains that it considers the evidence may be of assistance to the court and other parties given the withdrawal of mr hill's appeal and the receipt of evidence statements from the s 274 parties. [4] the other parties were asked to advise the court of their position on the application by 11 may 2016. there has been no opposition. consideration [5] in granting a waiver under s 281 of the resource management act 1991, the court must be satisfied that none of the parties to the proceeding will be unduly prejudiced.

in the high court of new zealand whanganui registry civ-2016-483-17 [2016] nzhc 1020 under the trustee act 1956 in the matter of the neil wilsher family trust between margaret helen reid plaintiff and may harriet wilsher defendant on the papers: counsel: m j bullock for plaintiff judgment: 18 may 2016 judgment of clifford j [1] the neil wilsher family trust (the trust) was established by mr wilsher in march 1992. mr wilsher is deceased. since establishment, the trustees of the trust have been the applicant, margaret reid, along with her mother, may harriet wilsher and her sister, barbara may wolfenden (now wilsher). [2] mrs may wilsher is no longer mentally competent. acting under s 43 of the trustee act 1956, margaret reid and barbara wilsher have recently appointed a new trustee in mrs may wilsher’s place. that new trustee is jrt trustees limited. [3] to enable the trust to continue to function, and for the trustees to deal with the property of the trust, mrs reid now seeks orders under s 52 of the trustee act 1956 vesting the trust’s property at 19a fergusson street, whanganui in the names of herself, her sister barbara wilsher and jrt trustees limited as the current trustees of the trust. at the same time, mrs reid also seeks an order removing her mother, mrs may wilsher, as a trustee. [4] as a preliminary matter, i note that at the same time as filing her statement of claim, mrs reid applied for an order that service on her mother be dispensed with and that the application be decided on the papers. having read the affidavit material, including the medical reports provided, i am satisfied that service on mrs wilsher would serve no purpose. i am also satisfied that mrs barbara wilsher and jrt trustees limited support mrs margaret reid’s application. i therefore order that service of the proceeding on mrs wilsher be dispensed with and that no other person need be served. i also determine that it is appropriate to decide this application, as requested, on the papers. [5] i am not persuaded that an order removing mrs may wilsher as trustee is called for. under s 43 of the trustee act, jrt trustees limited has been appointed a trustee in place of mrs may wilsher, because mrs may wilsher is unfit to act. that appointment, in my view, brings mrs may wilsher’s trusteeship to an end. adopting the words of s 43(1), jrt trustees has been appointed “in the place of” mrs may wilsher. her appointment is, therefore, at an end. [6] it is, however, appropriate to make the order vesting the trust property in the names of the three continuing trustees. section 52 of the trustee act provides for the making of such a vesting order in these circumstances. accordingly, there will be an order vesting the property at 19a fergusson street, whanganui, certificate of title wn40d/141 in the names of the plaintiff, margaret helen reid, her sister, barbara may wilsher and jrt trustees limited. “clifford j” solicitors: bullock and associates, whanganui for plaintiff

[3] their challenge to the decision of the deputy-registrar was evaluated by wild j in accordance with the principles laid down by this court in reekie.9 the judge’s reasons make convincing reading. the proposed appeal does not raise any issue of public or general importance and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice. [4] the second application is without merit. in reekie, this court held that there is no right to apply under s 61a(2) of the judicatureact in respect of a decision of a single judge dismissing an application to review a decision of a registrar declining to dispense with security.10 solicitors: sellar bone,auckland for respondents 3 spence v lynch [2013] nzhc 1478. 4 white v spence [2014] nzca 298. it appears that the appeal was ultimately abandoned by the official assignee. 5 at [28]. 6 white v lynch [2015] nzhc 1020. 7 at [86]–[87]. 8 white v lynch [2015] nzhc 3202. 9 reekie v attorney-general [2014] nzsc 63, [2014]1 nzlr 737. 10 reekie, above n 9, at [26].

[3] the will is held by graham takarangi, a solicitor in whanganui. he has been instructed by matiu to act in relation to the will. [4] relationships have broken down between the parties. ms bradbury says that matiu and mr takarangi have been excluding her from communications regarding the estate. she wants to progress the estate administration, but says that mr takarangi refuses to take instructions from her. rather, he has been instructed by matiu and diane, even though she is no longer an executor due to the dissolution of marnage. estate ofh h ratana [2016] nzhc 911 [5 may 2016] [5] ms bradbury's solicitors have repeatedly written to mr takarangi without any response, leading to a complaint to the law society. mr takarangi is now refusing to take any further action on the will, because he has not been paid. he also refuses to hand over the will to ms bradbury's solicitors, on the basis that matiu has instructed him not to. he says that he is not permitted to hand over the file without instructions from matiu. it also appears that mr takarangi has not heard from matiu for several months. [6] as such, there is an impasse where ms bradbury cannot apply for probate without a copy of the will, and mr takarangi cannot take further steps in the matter without instructions from mr ratana, who he has not heard from.

[2] at issue was a 2014 transaction in which the father transferred farm land in maraekakaho to the applicant’s brother. the allegation is the farm was sold at an undervalue to the brother because it did not take into account the potential of irrigation on the property. the father’s capacity at the time of the transaction is the central issue. [3] there is, in the context of this litigation, an application for non-party discovery. the non-parties are lawyers and accountants who advised the father in the transaction. [4] the present attorneys for the father have now waived privilege in respect of relevant documents held by the legal and accounting advisors and separate counsel for the father now also consents to the waiver of confidentiality. [5] the non-parties now officially abide the decision in light of these developments. [6] it is in order therefore for orders for discovery against the non-parties to be made on the papers and without further formality. [7] in light of the urgency of this matter balanced against the difficulties mr mason now faces due to a fire in his offices, i propose to allow 15 working days for discovery to be completed and then the matter will be set down for a judicial telephone conference to finalise timetabling to trial. ___________________________ williams j solicitors: g mason, barrister, palmerston north j p harding, solicitor, waipukurau g j c ferguson, gifford devine, hastings

[2] when the transfer application came before judge davidson on 6 april 2016, mr brown was to join the hearing by avl but failed to appear at the district court in dunedin. he said he was unaware of the arrangement. judge davidson rather doubted that that was so given the evidence he had seen of an email sent to the defendant about the hearing. [3] the substantive proceeding involves a charge of criminal trespass in relation to the grounds of parliament. [4] mr brown’s filings are voluminous, tendentious, and only occasionally relevant. but the essence of his case in terms of his application for leave is that judge davidson had formerly acted for mr brown when he was a practitioner and should have recused himself and that mr brown was not given a hearing. [5] he has now filed a memorandum asking that the application for leave to appeal also be heard by way of avl. the crown abides but notes, given the nature of mr brown’s communications with the court that control over the proceedings by avl may prove more difficult. [6] to complicate matters, mr brown indicates he has a mackenzie friend who he wishes to appear with him. whether that will be allowed, will of course be a matter for the judge who hears the application for leave. [7] i direct that the applicant be permitted to join the hearing of his leave application by avl. ___________________________ williams j solicitors: crown solicitor, wellington cc: m r brown

in the high court of new zealand wellington registry civ-2016-485-34 [2016] nzhc 867 between new style holdings limited applicant and revolution technologies limited respondent hearing: 3 may 2016 counsel: j d haig for the applicant no appearance for the respondent mr reid, a director of the respondent, in attendance judgment: 3 may2016 oral judgment of associate judge smith [1] the applicant applied on 27 january 2016 for an order setting aside a statutory demand issued by the respondent on 13 january 2016. [2] in response to the setting aside application, mr reid, a director of the respondent, filed a document described as a statement of counterclaim. he also filed an affirmation in support. [3] the application was called before associate judge osborne on 5 april 2016. at that hearing, mr dewar, who had previously acted for the respondent, was granted leave to withdraw. mr reid attended the hearing ( as he has this morning), and the associate judge gave leave to mr reid to be heard that day in opposition to the application. the associate judge concluded that mr reid had told him nothing indicating that the case was appropriate for the company to be granted leave to be represented by its director. the associate judge declined leave to the respondent to be represented by its director. new style holdings limited v revolution technologies limited [2016] nzhc 867 [3 may 2016] [4] the associate judge made certain directions on the basis that, if counsel were appointed to act for the respondent within 10 working days, a fixture would be allocated to hear the application on a defended basis. if there was no notification of the appointment of counsel within the 10 working day period, the associate judge reserved leave to the applicant to have the proceeding brought on in the next list before me to have the application granted on the papers. [5] the respondent has not appointed counsel, and the case has accordingly been listed today for hearing. [6] i have explained today to mr reid that he has no right of audience on behalf of the respondent. nor did he have any entitlement to file court documents on behalf of the respondent: the privileges of filing documents on behalf of a company and (subject to a very limited number of exceptions which do not apply here) appearing before the high court on behalf of a company, are reserved to barristers and solicitors. [7] i have considered the affidavit of mr boyko filed in support of the originating application, and on the face of it, it appears that there is a sufficient basis of dispute (primarily concerned with delays in getting the work done) that it is appropriate to make the order setting aside the statutory demand. i make an order accordingly. [8] i note in passing the reference in associate judge osborne's minute dated 5 april 2016 that mr reid apparently advised that the respondent is insolvent, and that that position would be worsened if the company were required to retain counsel. however that does not in my view justify the grant of audience rights to mr reid. i agree with the associate judge's decision in that regard.

[3] the applicants’ underlying challenge to deportation seems to be largely premised on the contention that prejudice to the child who is a new zealand citizen (in the sense that the deportation of her parents and siblings will not be in her best interests) is a trumping consideration. the immigration officer did not accept that it was. there is nothing particularly surprising about that or any other aspect of the decisions of the immigration officer. [4] section 177 has been recently amended and we accept there may be points about the interpretation and limits of the new section that would meet the general or public importance test. but we do not see the facts of this case or the arguments that the applicants want to advance as providing a suitable vehicle for addressing such points. we likewise do not see any risk that there will be a miscarriage of justice if leave is not given. solicitors: vallant hooker & partners,auckland forapplicants crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent

[2] the associate judge reserved for consideration by a judge of this court the question of whether orders in terms of the prayers for relief contained in prayers (a) and (b) of the statement of claim should be made. he quite rightly considered that he did not possess jurisdiction to deal with those matters. [3] the matter came before me in a duty judge list. but for one matter, and having regard to the evidence review by associate judge doogue and which i have also carefully considered, the prayers for relief contained in the statement of claim are, in fact, justified. there is now, as a result of the order for directions as to service, no person who can oppose the making of those orders. [4] the one concern i had related to a caveat that had been lodged against the property which is the subject of this proceeding. my concern, however, has been fully addressed because counsel advises me that as a result of settlement discussions the caveator has withdrawn the caveat. counsel has made available to me an historic search copy of the composite computer register which discloses the withdrawal of the caveat having been entered at 12:18 pm on 14april 2016. theresult is that there is no person who can oppose the making of the orders sought in the prayers for relief in the statement of claim. [5] i am satisfied that judgment in accordance with those prayers for relief should be entered. accordingly, i enter judgment as sought in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the plaintiffs’ statement of claim. ja faire j

[3] in short, on 4 december 2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle differences, the essence of which was that mr kelly would pay ms davidson the sum of $300,000 in accordance with an agreed schedule of payments. my first judgment related to a particular default which resulted in the court making a compliance order directing payment of the sum of $35,000 by 16 march 2016. [4] mr beresford has advised the court that a further payment of $20,000 was due to be paid by mr kelly to ms davidson on 31 march 2016, but had not been received. [5] in reply, mr locke says that mr kelly has been “energetically pursuing a business transaction that will enable him to rectify the regrettable defaults in payment”. reference is also made to a medical condition which is affecting him. although mr locke anticipates a transaction within the next 10 days, he says he can do no more at present and in those circumstances is unable to offer any basis as to why the court should not accede to the enforcement steps which the plaintiff now requests. [6] there is no reason why a compliance order should not now be made in terms of the parties’ agreement to that effect. [7] i make a compliance order directing that mr kelly pay ms davidson the sum of$20,000 by5.00 pm on 18april2016. if payment is not made, ms davidson will be at liberty to enforce payment of the debt. [8] i reserve any issues as to interest payable from the date of default to the date of payment, and as to costs in respect of ms davidson’s application for the above compliance order. ba corkill judge judgment signed at 2.45 pm on 15 april 2016

[2] under s 14 of the bailact 2000, the court must not admit an appellant to bail unless satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the interests of justice require it. [3] all i have before me are brief memoranda from the appellant's counsel, mrkidd, and a replyfrom the crown, which points out that mr marsters is serving a sentence of 10 years 6 months’ imprisonment for serious offending. marsters v r [2016] nzca125[13april 2016] [4] the memoranda from mr kidd assert that mr marsters has a strong case, but there is no supporting justification for that claim. mr marsters says a witness has recanted, but counsel advised that he himself has not read the transcript. it must be said that counsel's first memorandum conveys the clear impression that he had not then read s 14 either. [5] mr marsters also says that he wants bail on account of the health needs of his wife and a relative. there is no evidence of these matters, counsel having declined an invitation to file some.

[2] the document amends mr gates' earlier will dated 15 august 2013. that will was duly executed at the offices ofargyle welsh finnigan, a firm of solicitors in ashburton. under that will the beneficiaries of mr gates' estate were his two sons, colin and edward. they were also the executors of his estate, together with alister argyle, solicitor.

(b) the foot of the first page of the will is marked "p.t.o".

[5] an affidavit has also been filed by brendon soal. he was a patient in ashburton hospital and was placed in the same room as mr gates. he had known mr gates for 35 years. mr gates was anxious to have a new will completed. on 24 april 2014 mr gates produced the document and asked mr soal to sign it as one of the witnesses to his will. mr gates had already signed the will. mr soal was familiar with mr gates' signature and knew the signature on the document to be that of mr gates. mr soal signed the document on the first page but is unable to say whether the handwritten additions on the second page were present as he was not asked to sign that page. there was no other witness present at this time. [6] mr gates' two sons, colin and edward, have provided their consent to an order declaring the document to be valid.

[2] the crown have suggested a starting point of four to four and a half years, it being in the lower band 2 of r v fatu (2005) 22 crnz 524 (ca). that range is three to nine years. i agree with that but intend to take the lower end of that, of four years. i apply an uplift of six months due to recent serious relevant previous convictions which left me with four years six months. from that i give you allowance of six months for your restricted bail conditions and also your endeavour to partially complete or your partial completion of rehabilitation and, by way of encouragement, for you to continue along that path in future for which you have a determination. [3] that leaves me with an end starting point of four years’ imprisonment. for that i give you a credit of 20 percent for your guilty plea and acknowledgement of responsibility. that, in my view, once again applying a generous credit is 10 months, which brings me back to an end sentence of three years and two months on the charge of supplying methamphetamine. r g marshall district court judge
before the environment court decision no. [2016] nzenvc 0~-g in the matter ofan appeal under section 325 ofthe resource management act 1991 (the act) between ga vin leslie johnson (env-2015-akl-000117) appellant and auckland council respondent hearing at: auckland, 16 march 2016 court: environment judge ja smith appearances: mr v tamatea for the respondent council mr g johnson for himself date of determination: 16 march 2016 oral determination of the environment court a. the abatement notices dated 18 and 19 august 2015 are cancelled by consent. b. no costs were sought and there is no order for costs. the parties are encouraged to try and resolve the underlying issues by \ agreement. 2 reasons for decision introduction [1] this matter relates to two appeals from abatement notices issued by the council on 18 and 19 august 2015. they relate to a property at 2 couldrey street eden terrace, auckland and the abatement notices relate to certain alleged breaches of development controls for the permitted activities of residential units. progress [2] prior to hearing formal submissions from the parties mr tamatea and mr johnson held discussions. as a result the council has applied to cancel the abatement notices (it would also cancel these of its own volition). neither party has sought orders for costs. [3] on this basis it is not necessary for the court to address the particular abatement notices or the merits ofthe appeal in any particular degree. [4] i do point out that it is important when issuing abatement notices that the reasoning for the abatement notice and the outcome sought are transparent within the notice. given the complexity of the auckland plan it is necessary to set out all of the various provisions that make the ~ctivity require a consent, especially when it is a permitted activity in itself. also, it is important to ensure that the outcome sought in terms ofthe abatement notice reflect the breaches that are alleged. [5] the court need not comment any further, given that in the end it was not required to reach any decision as to whether these particular notices were appropriate for confirmation. final comment [6] as a result both abatement notices are cancelled by consent and neither party seeks costs and accordingly there is no order for costs. i encourage the parties to try and resolve the underlying issues without recourse back to the courts. signed at auckland this 1j1h day of march 2016 gavin johnson v auckland council (oral determination)

[2] this decision only relates to the counterclaim filed by mr stutt. mr stutt, the defendant, did not pay the setting down fee for the counterclaim. he did not file or provide any briefs of evidence in support of the counterclaim in terms of the directions made. he did not appear at the hearing on 8 march 2016. [3] the plaintiff seeks dismissal of the counterclaim. i consider that it is appropriate that the counterclaim be dismissed. the defendant, mr stutt, did not appear at the hearing. rule 15.2 allows for dismissal for want of prosecution of a counterclaim. [4] the other two matters raised may not of themselves lead to a dismissal. however they add to the failure of the defendant to prosecute his counterclaim. result [5] the counterclaim is dismissed. costs [6] if the plaintiff seeks costs on the dismissal of the counterclaim she is to file a memorandum within ten days of today’s date setting out the reasons why costs should be awarded, the plaintiff having succeeded in her substantial claim upon which i awarded costs, and the amount sought. d j mcdonald district court judge

[2] the applicants by their counsel initially suggested that a certificate under s 45(5) cannot be given unless the s 45(3) criteria for an award of costs have been satisfied.2 that, however, is not the scheme of the section, as counsel in effect acknowledged in a supplementary submission. in this submission, counsel argued that an order under s 45(5) requires the exercise of a discretion and that no adequate basis has been advanced for the discretion to be exercised in favour of the respondents. [3] if it were not for s 45(2), an order for costs in the sum of $2,500 would have been made against the applicants.3 that this is so provides a logical basis for the making of the order which is sought by the respondents and we see no reason why such an order should not be made. solicitors: ord legal,wellingtonforapplicants gallawaycookallan, dunedinfor second andthird respondents 2 there is authority for this view, see svi hc hamilton civ-2009-419-139, 21 august 2009. there is also authority going the other way, which we prefer, see xv y [2000] 2 nzlr 748 (hc); and nd v ggh fc queenstown fam-2007-002-138,4 december 2009 at [10]–[14]. 3 and indeed such an order was initially made, the court not being aware at time of the legal aid position.

[2] primarily in issue is the judgment of the court of 10 august 2009.5 a first recall application in respect of it was dismissed on 13 september 2011. a second recall application was dismissed by minute of 22 september 2011. a third recall application was dismissed in the minute of 6 november 2012 to which we have referred. this prompted further complaints from mr slavich which were addressed and rejected in a minute of 29 january 2013. [3] there are now six formal judgments of this court which are addressed, more or less directly, to whether mr slavich should be granted leave to appeal his conviction.6 this is in addition to the three minutes to which we have referred. associated satellite litigation has resulted in a further seven judgments.7 the recall applications of 8 april 2013 and 31 march 2014 are, by our count, the fourth and fifth, respectively, in relation to the 10 august 2009 judgment. theyare an abuse of process and are dismissed (as is, consequentially, the application of 2 march 2015). [4] mr slavich’s complaints about the judgment of 10 february 2016 do not engage with the reasons why the court concluded that it had no jurisdiction to hear the appeals proposed in his april2012 applications. accordingly, wedo not propose to recall this judgment. 4 slavich v r [2009] nzsc 87. 5 slavich v r [2009] nzsc 87. 6 slavich v r [2009] nzsc 87; slavich v r [2011] nzsc 103; slavich v r [2011] nzsc 131; slavich v r [2015] nzsc 174; slavich v r [2015] nzsc195; and slavich v r [2016] nzsc5. 7 slavich v r [2011] nzsc 139; slavich v attorney-general [2013] nzsc 130; slavich v attorney-general [2014] nzsc 22; slavich v attorney-general [2014] nzsc 46; slavich v judges of the supreme court [2015] nzsc 125; slavich v judges of the supreme court [2015] nzsc130; and slavich v judges of the supreme court [2015]nzsc 151.

[2] the application should not have been accepted for filing by the registrar. as cooke j noted in re g j mannix, “a company has no right to be represented in the conduct of a case in court except by a barrister”.1 the learned judge went on to note that “there is a cognate rule that, apart from statutory exceptions, a corporation has no right to bring or carry on proceedings in a court except by a solicitor. this refers to the filing of documents, writs, statements of defence, notices of appeal, etc….”2 [3] the application, then, was defective from the outset. 1 re g j mannix [1984] 1 nzlr 309 (ca) at 310. 2 at 311. cudby & meade limited v david stevens [2016] nzhc 446 [15 march 2016] [4] the application was also out of time. under s 290(2) of the companies act 1993 (the act), an application to set aside a statutory demand is required to be filed and served within ten working days of the date of service of the demand. in this case, there are issues over when the application to set aside was served, but i do not need to consider them further. the application itself was not filed in court until one day after the ten working day period allowed for filing had expired. [5] under s 290(3) of the act, the court has no power to extend the time for the filing and service of the setting aside application. [6] for the foregoing reasons, the purported application to set aside the statutory demand is dismissed. there will be an order for costs in mr stevens’favour on a 2b basis, plus disbursements as fixed by the registrar. associate judge smith solicitors: no appearance for the applicant thomas dewar sziranyi letts, lower hutt for the respondent

[3] it is accepted that in the normal course of events costs follow the event and normally the authority will use a daily tariff approach when addressing such a claim.3 the normal starting point is $3,500 per day and from there adjustment may be made depending on the circumstances. 1 [2016] nzera wellington 15 2 jason nathan v transfield services (new zealand) limited [2015] nzera wellington 120 3 refer pbo ltd (formerly rush security ltd) v da cruz [2005] ernz 808 [4] the investigation meeting took approximately half a day which would mean, applying the above approach, an award in the order of $1750. that is what broadspectrum seeks, along with reimbursement of its filing fee. the total sought is $1,821.56. [5] mr nathan’s response is just over two pages. that said all but three lines is devoted to assertions broadspectrum has failed to properly pay amounts awarded in the determination that ordered his reinstatement.4 he goes on to propose these payments be used to offset or contribute toward any costs that i owe regarding the second determination february 2016. [6] on behalf of broadspectrum mr upton responds with: … even if broadspectrum does owe him remuneration (which is denied) then that is an entirely separate issue to whatever costs mr nathan may owe to broadspectrum as a result of his unsuccessful proceedings. the former has no relevance to the latter. [7] mr upton is correct. if, as mr nathan alleges, broadspectrum has failed to adhere to the earlier orders that should be addressed via a compliance application. it cannot be integrated with this given it is a stand-alone proceeding. [8] i therefore choose to apply the normal tariff approach given that is what is sought and the absence of a valid argument as to why i should not do so. the filing fee is a given. [9] accordingly i order mr nathan pay broadspectrum (new zealand) limited the sum of $1,821.56 (one thousand, eight hundred twenty one dollars and fifty six cents) as a contribution toward the costs it incurred in pursuing its successful application. m b loftus member of the employment relations authority 4 n.2 above

[3] it is plain that all of the applications before the associate judge were interlocutory applications, and that in dealing with them the judge was exercising the powers of a high court judge sitting in chambers.2 [4] that being the case, any challenge to the judgment should have been by way of an application for review under s 26p(1) of the judicature act 1908, and not by appeal to this court. the appellant was offered an opportunity to make submissions to the contrary. his submission of 25 february 2016 did not respond to the jurisdictional issue but effectively expressed a preference that the matter be heard as an appeal in this court. it appears that some of the reasons for his preference may be based on a misapprehension that a review would be dealt with by associate judge christiansen. that of course is not the case; the review would be conducted by a judge of the high court. [5] any application for review would now need to be preceded by an application to extend the time for making the application having regard to the time limits in r 2.3(2) of the high court rules. [6] however, we are satisfied that this court does not have jurisdiction to deal with the purported appeal. on that basis, the appeal is dismissed.

[2] earlier this year, on 22 january 2016, you asked the court for an indication as to the likely sentence that would be imposed in the event that you were to accept responsibility for what had happened and to plead guilty. [3] his honour judge andrée wiltens heard argument put before him from your counsel and also counsel for the crown and he indicated to you that the starting point in terms of your offending would be a period of four-and-a-half years’ imprisonment. he indicated to you, though, that if you were prepared to plead guilty at this point, you would receive a discount of 25 percent on that sentence. [4] you subsequently accepted the indication given by judge andrée wiltens and it simply remains for me today to impose the ultimate sentence. [5] ms te whata, on your behalf, has filed brief submissions and it is accepted now that i should give you that discount, but unfortunately there is not much else that i can take into account. i was disturbed to read the pre-sentence report which indicated that, even at this late stage, you were not accepting responsibility for what had occurred. however, ms te whata assures me this morning that that must be a misinterpretation by the report-writer and that you are indeed accepting responsibility. [6] i have before me now, which was not before the court earlier, a victim impact statement and that simply confirms what the court invariably finds in this type of case and that is the long-felt emotional and psychological harm that victims of sexual abuse suffer from long after the actual events themselves. [7] in reality i have to carry out a mathematical exercise. from the starting point of four-and-a-half years’ imprisonment, which you have accepted, i give you the maximum discount of 25 percent, as indicated by judge andrée wiltens and fix the final sentence of one of three years and four months’ imprisonment. [8] you are sentenced to three years and four months’ imprisonment on this charge accordingly. c s blackie district court judge

[2] i therefore dete1mine: (a) that the plaintiff will pay costs of $5,908.00 to the first defendant in respect of the plaintiff's interlocutory application heard on 2 february 2016;and (b) that the plaintiff will pay costs of $5,167.50 to the second defendant. [3] high comi rule 14.8 is clear. costs on interlocutory applications must be fixed in accordance with the rules when the application is determined and become payable when they are fixed, in the absence of "special reasons to the contrary". no such special reasons have been advanced. the rule will therefore apply on its terms. i do not understand that the concepts of "costs in any event" and "costs in the proceedings" feature in this comi's rules. clifford j solicitors: langford law, wellington for plaintiff izard weston, wellington for first defendant preston russell law, invercargill for second defendant

[2] the offending occurred in two separate lots and i have detailed that in the comments i made to you on 21 january when i gave you the sentence indication. i have comprehensively set out there. the sentence indication which you accepted was an overall sentence of four years’ imprisonment including the deductions that you would get for the pleas of guilty that you have been entered. [3] since that time i have received a considerable amount of information from the probation officer. i have read the letter that you have written and i have read the submissions that the lawyers have made. it is to be hoped, mr teddy, that as you say approaching the age of 50 you might have decided that it is time to call this sort of a lifestyle quits. only you will know that. i accept that you are genuine in your remorse for what has happened and also for the difficulty that you find yourself in and that you have placed your friends and family in as a result of the sentencing exercise today. i have considered whether there should be a further discount but bearing in mind that there was no uplift for your prior multiple offending in the past i have decided to leave it where it is. [4] i have taken into account all of the provisions of the sentencing act 2002 and overall the sentence indication that i gave you will be the sentence imposed upon you. in relation to the offering to supply you will be sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. on the other three charges you will be sentenced to three years’ imprisonment on each. all terms are concurrent, running together, making a total of four years. the four years is made up out of totality rather than charge by charge and that is the way that i have attributed the sentence to each of the offences. [5] as i have already said, i can tell you are remorseful and hopefully a little more insightful. that cannot change the outcome but hopefully when you are released you continue on with the progress that you have made up until now and we see the last of you. [6] your sentence of community work is cancelled. g a rea district court judge

[5] however, i have indicated to counsel for mr and mrs taiamoni, ms kennedy, that a simple application and memorandum can be drawn to my attention within six months and put to me in chambers for me to make final orders. at that time i will note that the child’s name will be changed for the birth certificate purposes to billie moana taiamoni. a b lendrum family court judge

[2] agreement was reached at the conference that vw is a child in need of care and protection. the conference acknowledged that the overall goal was for vw to be in the care of her whanau and that there was no realistic possibility of vw returning to the full-time care of either parent. [3] the affidavit evidence provided confirms that there are ample grounds for the making of this declaration. vw’s mother, ms ah, has an extensive history with child, youth and family and an involvement with youth justice. there are also concerns in relation to ms ah’s mental health. both parents have criminal records and have been involved in a turbulent relationship involving instability and domestic violence. another child, p, was removed from their care in 2012. [4] i am satisfied that the grounds are made out for the making of a declaration and accordingly i make the following orders: (a) i make a declaration that vw is a child in need of care and protection pursuant to s 14(1)(a), (b) and (f) children, young persons, and their families act 1989.

[4] we are not satisfied that it necessary in the interests of justice that we hear and determine this appeal. the decision of the court of appeal on mr stockman’s recall application involves no issue of general or public importance, nor is there any appearance of a miscarriage of justice. the same is true of the court of appeal’s decision on costs which mr stockman sought to recall.

[3] this ground of appeal was not advanced to the court of appeal. in those circumstances we invited counsel for the crown to make inquiries. we were subsequentlyadvised that: (a) the detective has not worked at the school since 2006. (b) while at the school he had an association with one of the caretakers who was employed there but this person was not on the jury. (c) he recalls another person, whom he knew as “dave”, who worked at the school as a caretaker but cannot say whether he was the foreman as he would not now recognise him. on the basis of the submissions we received from the applicant in response to what wewere told bycounsel, wedoubt whether “dave” was on the jury. further, even if he was on the jury, we see no basis for concern that his prior limited association with the detective would have affected the jury's assessment of the case. accordingly, we see no appearance of a miscarriage of justice in relation to this issue. [4] the applicant in his most recent submissions has raised other points (one as to the evidence of doctors and dna and the other as to differences between his daughter’s original statement and her evidence). he did not develop any arguments as to these points. having considered the judgment of the court of appeal, we are not persuaded that theywarrant the grant of leave to appeal. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent

[3] there is clear authoritythat the court ofappeal has jurisdiction under r 29a to give an extension of time for the commencement of a new appeal even if the earlier appeal has been deemed to be abandoned under r 43 and an application for its revival has not been made within the three month period, meaning that the original appeal is not able to be revived.2 the applicant’s submission to the contrary is wrong. the existence of this jurisdiction was not disputed, nor was there any suggestion that the court of appeal had wrongly interpreted r 29a. accordingly, there was no error in the judgment of this court. [4] the applicant also says that the court was wrong to say that the applicant’s first appeal was deemed to be abandoned under r 43(1) because he did not file a case on appeal and applyfor ahearingdate within the timespecified in r 43. hesays that the real reason was that he was unable to paysecurityfor costs, which prevented him from filing the case on appeal and seeking a hearing. there was no inaccuracy in this court’s judgment. the statement that the applicant did not file a case on appeal and apply for a hearing within the time specified in r 43 was factuallycorrect. [5] the application for recall is therefore dismissed. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondents sexton v rice craig [2007] nzca200 at [31]; siemer v stiassny [2009] nzca624 at [25].
