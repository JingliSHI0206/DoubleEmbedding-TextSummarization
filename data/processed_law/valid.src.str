[2] ms mitchell has appealed to this court against her conviction and sentence. [3] ms mitchell has applied for bail pending determination of her appeal pursuant to s 70 of the bail act 2000, which i have considered pursuant to s 393(2)(d) of the crimesact 1961. [4] the bail act provides that bail is not to be granted unless the court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it would be in the best interests of justice in the particular case. ms mitchell has the onus of showing cause why bail should be granted. mitchellv r [2015] nzca634[21december 2015] [5] i note that ms mitchell’s notice of appeal recites that her counsel is christopher tennet. however, ms mitchell herself has filed the application for bail on 16 december 2015. the application does not provide any grounds in support. on 17 december a member of the registry communicated a message to ms mitchell that anyfurther submissions are to be filed in writing as soon as possible. [6] ms mitchell has advised the registry that she has been deprived of access to facilities which would enable her to prepare written submissions. i am unable to comment on that allegation. the attention of the prison authorities is drawn to their statutory obligation to cooperate and make facilities available to prison inmates whenever they are reasonably requested.

[2] nr says that he has instructed a lawyer to represent him on the cross-appeal. he explains the lawyer’s absence from the record bysaying that he is not prepared to spend money on a lawyer unless he is sure that he has security for costs. nr v districtcourtatauckland &anor [2015] nzca625[18 december 2015] [3] the decision was manifestly correct. only when a practising solicitor appears on the record for nr and takes responsibility for the appeal would it be appropriate to consider revisiting the registrar’s decision. costs are payable only in respect of steps taken bya lawyer in a proceeding.

[2] on 10 november 2015 the registrar requested cpl to provide further information in support ofthe feewaiverapplication by24 november 2015. cpldid not respond to the registrar’s request. on 4 december the registrar formally declined the fee waiver application. chesterfields preschools limited vthe commissioner of inland revenue [2015] nzca626 [17 december 2015] [3] on 15 december 2015 cpl applied to review the registrar’s decision. the grounds for cpl’s application, made in a memorandum filed by therese sisson, are difficult to follow. as best i can discern them, they are that ms sisson cannot pay the fee. however, ms sisson is not the appellant. her financial circumstances are irrelevant. [4] iadd that ms sisson does not appear to havea current practising certificate as a barrister and solicitor and thus has no apparent standing to represent cpl. [5] ms sisson also refers to a public interest ground to support waiver. however, on analysis the ground is no more than an assertion that the appeal has merit.

in the high court of new zealand wellington registry civ 2015-485-614729 [2015] nzhc 3283 in the matter of the estate oftamali'i tanuvasa pepe maua tupuola applicant on the papers judgment: 1 7 december 2015 judgment of mallon j [1] ms pepe tupuola (the applicant) applies for a grant of letters of administration. the grant is sought in respect of the estate of tamali'i tanuvasa, who was the applicant's sister. the application was declined by the registrar on the ground that it should have been made by the two daughters of the deceased. the applicant seeks review of that decision. the review has been referred to me for consideration. [2] the deceased died intestate. the deceased was survived by two children (mele tanuvasa and merita iopu) and six brothers and sisters (one of whom is the applicant). the gross value ofthe estate does not exceed $20,000. it is comprised of kiwisaver funds of slightly over $15,000 and the balance is held in a westpac current account. the provider of the kiwisaver funds requires letters of administration. [3] pursuant to s 77 of the administration act 1969 (the act), the children (ms tanuvasa and ms iopu) are the beneficiaries of the estate. they have each sworn affidavits. they are 41 and 42 years old respectively. they both reside in western samoa. they each understand that they are entitled to apply to be the estate oftamali'i tanuvasa [2015] nzhc 3283 [17 december 2015] administrator of their mother's estate. they do not wish to do so. they have each signed a formal consent for the applicant to be appointed. the five other siblings of the deceased have all been given notice of the applicant's intention to apply for the grant and none have objected. [4] the grant of administration is sought pursuant to s 6(2) of the act. that permits the court to grant administration to such person as it thinks expedient by reason of special circumstances, notwithstanding that some other person would by law be entitled to a grant of administration. 1 the special circumstances relied on are as follows: (a) the two persons beneficially interested in the estate reside out of new zealand, do not wish to apply for administration, and consent to the application made. (b) the applicant is the deceased 's sister. she is familiar with the deceased's affairs. the five other siblings of the deceased have not objected to the application. ( c) the estate is small. ( d) an alternative would be for the beneficiaries to appoint the applicant as attorney. this involves disproportionate cost, given the size of the estate, and the beneficiaries do not want to apply for letters of administration. [5] the application has been made on proper grounds. the applicant has made all the appropriate inquiries. the grounds are suppmied by the material presented to the comi. i am satisfied that there are special circumstances making it appropriate to grant the application under s 6(2) ofthe act.

[3] ihave read the judgments ofmoorej and ofthe court ofappeal. thecourt of appeal was of the view that the appeal against moore j’s judgment was not seriously arguable. i regard the reasons given by that court as convincing and i am not persuaded that there is sufficient merit in the appeal to that court or the proposed appeal to this court to warrant the making of a further order suppressing publication of the applicant’s name.

[2] mr hollister-jones submitted that it was appropriate to put the subsequent statement to mr waititi to complete the interview record. mr fairbrother objected that this was not a proper use of s 35(2) of the evidence act 2006 and that his challenge to mr waititi’s evidence went to credibility rather than veracity or accuracy. he said in short that the inconsistency between the first statement and the evidence in court revealed a contrived account and that by putting the first statement to him he has shown this to the jury. [3] section 35(2) states: (2) a previous statement of a witness that is consistent with the witness's evidence is admissible to the extent that the statement is necessary to respond to a challenge to the witness's veracity or accuracy, based on a previous inconsistent statement of the witness or on a claim of recent invention on the part of the witness. [4] tipping j relevantly set the frame for admission of prior consistent statements in this way:1 [37] while the veracity or accuracy of evidence given in court is not necessarily enhanced because of repetition, the policy of the subsection is that in qualifying circumstances, of which the judge is the gatekeeper, it is significant that a witness has said the same thing before. the trier of fact should be aware of that fact and assess its weight in the light of all the relevant circumstances [38] it is important however, to reiterate that a general attack on a witness’s veracity or accuracy is not enough to trigger the operation of subs (2). the attack must be based either on a previous inconsistent statement or on a claim of recent invention. conceptually the former is quite straightforward. hart v r [2010] nzsc 91; [2011] 1 nzlr 1. [5] mr fairbrother, quite properly in my view, conceded that the section literally applied in this case. i am also satisfied that the question about the second statement can be properly put to mr waititi to complete the record of his interviews and to respond to a challenge to the accuracy of his evidence. insofar as this touches upon his credibility, that might be so, but it was quite plain to me that mr waititi’s accuracy was also challenged by mr fairbrother in putting his first statement to him. [6] in those circumstances i considered that s 35(2) was properly in play and i directed that mr hollister-jones could put the question to mr waititi.

[2] it is generally the position that costs follow the event but, ultimately, the judge retains a discretion. this is one of those cases in which i consider that costs should be reserved rather than fixed now. there are two reasons for this. the first is that relied on by the applicants; they have been left in the position of being unable to deal with their property while the first respondent has done nothing to advance matters towards a proper resolution of the obvious dispute between them. even in the face of the application for an order to remove the caveat the first respondent did nothing to advance matters. secondly, the dispute will ultimately involve a significant credibility contest between the applicants and the third respondent. if the applicants prevail at trial any costs fixed now will need to be re-visited. in these circumstances i consider it preferable for both parties that costs be reserved and fixed when the outcome of the substantive dispute is known. p courtney j

[2] in my judgment of 9 october 2015, i concluded by saying i saw no reason why costs should not follow the event. [3] i remain of that view. the question that i think does need to be considered, however, is mr toebes' submission that, in the circumstances, payment of costs should await the outcome of the substantive proceeding. i recognise of course that the rules provide as mr matsis has con-ectly pointed out for costs on interlocutory applications normally to be dealt with at the time those applications are resolved. however, that is not a universal rule. [4] the defendant, dorchester apartments ltd, represents all the owners of apartments in the dorchester complex. it is not, itself, in that sense a separate business entity. this is essentially a dispute between owners. questions of the need to raise funds to meet the award could arise. a costs order against the company would, indirectly, also appear to involve the plaintiffs paying costs to themselves. [5] in these unusual circumstances, i think the award and payment of costs is best left until the resolution of the substantive proceeding.

[2] although mr cutter is the brother-in-law of the trustee, richard james davies, and therefore an uncle of the remaining trustee, richard’s son jonathan, mr cutter is now entirely alienated from richard davies. [3] mr cutter, who is a retired clergyman resident in england, is in poor health and other family members have raised concern that if any request in relation to richard davies was referred to him, his entrenched enmity is such that it would be likely to adversely affect his health. [4] these unusual circumstances were cited in an application to the court for directions as to service, the proposal being that the court could dispense with service on mr cutter, given the verification of the situation i have summarised above in affidavits from other family members. [5] a preliminary concern on considering the papers was the absence of confirmation of consent to the change in the registered owners of the property, from richard davies’ former wife (mrs helen morris) who was acknowledged as a contingent beneficiary as to income from the trust. before deciding on appropriate directions as to service, i sought clarification of her position. [6] the plaintiffs have now filed additional affidavits that confirm mrs morris’s consent to the transfer. in that event, i am satisfied that service can be dispensed with entirely. [7] having reflected on all the matters raised, i am also satisfied that the relief sought is justified. i accordingly make the order sought in the statement of claim to vest the land in certificate of title nl7c/394 in the joint names of the plaintiffs. [8] although the costs of the proceeding are sought, that is not appropriate in circumstances where the defendant’s view is not being sought, so there will be no order as to costs. dobson j solicitors: england law, nelson for plaintiffs

[3] in his memorandum of 21 october 2015, mr jessen for ppg has put forward a solution which, for the purposes of the higher level plan change provisions, deals with the issue. that is, he proposes that the structure plan should not identify a northern access to the site at all, and the reference to a possible whitehead road access be deleted. [4] that will leave the position of a northern access point to be resolved at the point of decisions about resource consents for future activities on the site -a situation which put the relevant material before the then decision-maker. that will almost certainly produce a more workable and satisfactory result than arguing about it in the abstract. we ask that the final documents be drafted on that basis, for approval. dated at wellington the 5th day ofnovember 2015 ~~­ c j thompson environment judge

[2] mr manual appeals against the imposition of those conditions on the basis that they cannot be justified as being relevant to the risks identified in s 8 of the bail act 2000. [3] counsel for the respondent has noted that there is no record available of the judge’s notes as the transcription failed in the district court on the relevant date. however, this may be approached as a de novo hearing in anyevent. counsel for the respondent has accepted that there must be a sufficient nexus between the imposition of the conditions and the risks identified. in terms of the present alleged offending the respondent accepts that the appellant does not appear to have consumed alcohol and alcohol does not seem to have been involved in the alleged offending. [4] in the circumstances the respondent concedes there is little to indicate the alcohol related conditions bear sufficient nexus to the risks in this case. for those reasons the respondent does not oppose the appeal. [5] i agree. the appeal is allowed. the existing conditions of bail are varied to delete the conditions referred to at [1] above. the other conditions of bail imposed by the district court on 8 october remain in full force and effect. venning j

[5] to the extent that the application for recall appears to be part of a continuing attempt by mr slavich to subvert the high court order declaring him a vexatious litigant, it is also an abuse of process.

[2] in this court’s judgment, wesaid that the court ofappeal applied settled law when deciding whether an extension should be granted in the particular factual circumstances and that the application raised no question of public or general importance.3 in addition, this court said there had been nothing put before it by 1 sax v simpson [2015] nzsc 144 (williamyoung, glazebrook and o’reganjj). 2 sax v simpson [2015] nzca362 (randerson,white andwinkelmann jj). 3 sax v simpson, above n1, at [11]. janine davinasax vluke andrewsimpson[2015] nzsc 152[22october 2015] ms sax that suggested that the court ofappeal decision was erroneous or that there was a risk of a miscarriage of justice.4 [3] the majority of ms sax’s recall application mirrors her earlier application for leave to appeal. however, it differs in one respect: ms sax submits that this court erred in relying on the factual summary of the court of appeal with regard to her communications with that court’s registry. discussion [4] to the extent that ms sax’s application merely repeats arguments already dealt with, it provides no grounds for a recall. in addition, a recall application is not the proper forum to raise new matters, such as disputing the accuracy of the court of appeal’s factual summary.5 in any event, this court explicitly recognised that the factual background concerning ms sax’s communications with the court of appeal registry was “[a]t most … peripherally relevant to [whether there should have been an extension of time] and it would have no bearing on whether her application for leave to appeal to this court should be granted”.6 result [5] the application for recall is therefore dismissed. 4 at [11]. 5 see siemer v o’brien [2015]nzsc 89 at [3]; and creser v creser [2015] nzsc 116 at [4]. 6 sax v simpson, above n1, at n 13.

[2] a case management conference was held before associate judge sargisson on 16 april 2015. the associate judge’s minute records that parties, through heaphy v heaphy [2015] nzhc 2522 [14 october 2015] counsel, had agreed the current trustees be removed, and that an independent trustee be appointed in their place. counsel were to discuss potential appointees. [3] however, on the next case management conference occasion, 15 may 2015, the associate judge recorded that the parties had been unable to reach agreement and the matter would have to be determined by the court. [4] the matter was therefore called before me on 7 august 2015. at that point common sense again prevailed. after an adjournment of about an hour in which counsel and the parties held discussions, it was agreed that the existing trustees be removed and that lewis grant, an auckland solicitor, be appointed independent trustee instead pursuant to s 51. [5] the consent order provided for the court to determine costs (if not agreed). disagreement has again broken out. [6] lengthy submissions have been filed, advancing charge and counter-charge. but the fact remains that the defended hearing in which these matters could be examined by the court did not take place. in a situation in which the rights and wrongs of the matter are misty, i am not prepared to determine them on the basis of irreconcilable affidavits and submissions. [7] where the court is in a position to form a clear view as to the merits on a contested s 51 application, a costs order may be appropriate. in any other case, and this is one, it is not. there will therefore be no order for costs by the court. but the parties are entitled to apply to the new trustee for payment of their reasonable legal costs (as determined by the trustee) from the trust’s estate. stephen k j solicitors: jackson russell, auckland for mr heaphy stace hammond, auckland for ms mercer

[3] to succeed on the appeal, the applicant would have to persuade the court that (a) the trial judge’s finding of fact was wrong; and (b) the court of appeal’s approach to s 32(3) was incorrect. [4] the crown submissions are that there was an adequate evidential foundation for the finding of fact and we would not normally grant leave to allow such a finding to be challenged. as well, what was required was an assessment of the applicant’s purpose in holding the money at the time of seizure rather than an accurate prediction of how the moneywould be used in the future. [5] against that background we are of the view that the proposed appeal does not raise any issue of public or general importance and we see no appearance of a miscarriage. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent at [16]–[17].

[2] ms brabender was sentenced to home detention for five months, 150 hours’ community work and $45,721.58 reparation by way of $20.50 per week instalments. the reparation amount was believed by the court to have been agreed prior to sentencing and was imposed without further consideration.1 it is that part of the sentence that is now appealed. [3] on appeal mr ross explained that the reparation total was not agreed, and he had submitted a lesser sum was appropriate, based on the amount able to be paid and the length of time for which such an order should ensue. 1 ministry of social development v brabender [2015] nzdc 13481. [4] mr georgiou accepted that the current order, which would last for 43 years, was not supportable on the authorities. he acknowledged a length of around five years was generally imposed but noted that in r v vallily, eight years had been accepted.2 [5] as noted, the reparation commitment as it presently stands will continue for 43 years. previous authority has indicated such orders are not desirable. the length is unrealistic and bond the offender for an inordinate period of time.3 an order lasting for between three to five years is commonly substituted. r v vallily was somewhat different as the offender was expected to have means, and had agreed to repay at the rate of $5,000 per year. even then, the court limited reparation from the initial order of $87,000 to one of $40,000. [6] it is important when reaching agreement and/or making submissions, that an informant has proper regard to these previous authorities. the appeal is allowed. the reparation order is quashed and in its place there will be an order for reparation of $4,570 to be repaid at a rate of $20.00 per week. 2 r v vallily ca251/04, 10 november 2004. 3 r v bailey ca306/03, 10 may 2004; leighton v police [2012] nzhc 1925. ___________________________ simon france j solicitors: public defence service, wellington luke cunningham & clere, crown solicitors, wellington

[3] in november 2012, mr mcmaster and three co-accused were sentenced on convictionsforsexual violation byrape. theyhad each been convicted of onecount as a principal, and three counts as a party to rape. [4] appeals by mr mcmaster and three co-accused were partially successful to the extent that their convictions for being a party to three counts of sexual violation by rape were quashed.1 [5] following the appeals against conviction, those three co-accused have all pursued successful sentence appeals. in the case of dylan john o’neill and corey clinton owens, this court substituted sentences of 12 years and nine months’ imprisonment with sentences of 11 years and 10 months in each case.2 a third co-accused, samuel owen weenink, then made separate application and, adopting the reasoning in its earlier decision, this court similarly reduced mrweenink’s sentence from 12 years and nine months to 11 years and 10 months’ imprisonment.3 [6] mrmcmaster’s culpabilitywas treatedbythe sentencingjudgeas marginally greater than the others, resulting in an end sentence that was three months longer than the others. the crown accepts that parity requires mr mcmaster’s sentence to be reduced by the same extent as that determined by this court for the co-accused. we agree. [7] accordingly, the application for an extension of time to appeal is granted, and the appeal is allowed. the sentence of 13 years’ imprisonment is quashed. a sentence of 12 years and one month’s imprisonment is substituted. the reduction of 11 months achieves parityof treatment with the co-accused. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent 1 morton v r [2013]nzca667. 2 o’neill v r [2014]nzca466. 3 weenink v r [2014] nzca559.

[2] the respondent now seeks costs. its solicitor, mr johnson accepts that the matters in issue were not complex and the appeal should be treated as a standard appeal. he then notes that the respondent and/or its lawyers have: (a) drafted and filed a notice in support of the appeal on othergrounds; queensland maintenance services (nz)ltd v queensland maintenance services (pty) ltd (in liquidation) [2015] nzca454[22september 2015] (b) at the appellant’s request reviewed the draft index of the case on appeal; (c) received and reviewed the final version of the case on appeal; and (d) been engaged in ongoing communications with the court as to the setting down of the appeal, the hearing date and pre-appeal directions. [3] counsel for the appellant notes that the steps for which costs are sought are not referred to in schedule 2 to the court of appeal (civil) rules 2005. mr heard submits that although r 53d(1)(b) contemplates costs for steps not so included, counsel for the respondent has adopted a “granular analysis”, claiming for minor attendances of an insignificant nature. mr heard also submits that the respondent should have provided details of the actual costs incurred. [4] it is not disputed that the respondent has taken the steps referred to and in doing so has incurred some costs. in my assessment, it would be appropriate to make an allowance reflecting half a day in respect of the attendances to which the respondent has referred. calculated as for a standard appeal that results in an award of $995. [5] the respondent is entitled to costs in the sum of $995 consequent on the withdrawal of the appeal. solicitors: lee salmon long,auckland forappellant martelli mckegg,auckland for respondent

[2] in relation to his proposed conviction appeal, mr makanesi indicated in his application for leave to appeal that he wished to raise the issue of the competence of his appellate counsel. however, he has subsequently indicated that he wishes to 1 r v makanesi dc auckland cri-2011-004-19490, 5 december 2013. 2 makanesi v r [2015] nzca 134. sione fehoko makanesi v r [2015] nzsc 137 [21 september 2015] raise additional issues, including severance, competence of trial counsel, admissibility of evidence led by the crown, fresh evidence and the conduct of the jury. mr makanesi has not provided any detail or background to these grounds. [3] in the court of appeal, counsel for mr makanesi filed a memorandum dated 10 november 2014 advising that he had become involved as counsel after the notice of appeal was filed and that he had considered the file and discussed the position with mr makanesi. however, he did not at that point have clear instructions. subsequently, on 17 march 2015, counsel filed a further memorandum advising that he now had clear instructions from mr makanesi, which were that he wished to abandon his conviction appeal and proceed only with the sentence appeal. this is what then happened. [4] because mr makanesi abandoned his conviction appeal, none of the matters which he wishes to raise on appeal to this court has been addressed by the court of appeal. if mr makanesi wishes to pursue an appeal against his convictions, the appropriate course is that he applies to the court of appeal for leave to withdraw his notice of abandonment and reinstate his appeal. we understand that mr makanesi made such an application on 27 august 2015. [5] in relation to the sentence appeal, it raises no point of principle, nor does there appear to be any risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. [6] for these reasons, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed. solicitors: crown law office, wellington for respondent

[2] the court has a broad discretion as to costs. 3 while broad, the discretion is to be exercised judicially and in accordance with principles. the primary principle is that costs follow the event. 4 the usual starting point in ordinary cases is two-thirds of actual and reasonable costs. from that starting point factors that justify either an increase or a decrease are assessed. 1 robinson v pacific seals new zealand ltd [2014] nzempc 99. 2 robinson v pacific seals new zealand ltd [2015] nzempc 84. 3 employment relations act 2000, sch 3, cl 19. 4 victoria university of wellington v alton-lee [2001] ernz 305 (ca) at [48]. alan robinson v pacific seals new zealand ltd nzempc wellington [2015] nzempc 162 [18 september 2015] [3] the application for costs stumbles at the first hurdle. that is because there is nothing before the court to indicate whether the defendant has actually incurred any costs in defending the challenge or the application for rehearing,5 despite this omission being squarely pointed out by ms kennedy, counsel for the plaintiff, in a memorandum on costs 6 and despite a reply to that memorandum being filed on behalf of the defendant. [4] i am not satisfied that it is appropriate to make any order as to costs in the circumstances. i am unable to determine whether the defendant has incurred any costs and, if so, what any such costs have been. that, in turn, makes it impossible to assess what a reasonable contribution to costs might be. [5] the defendant’s application for costs is accordingly dismissed. christina inglis judge judgment signed at 11.30 am on 18 september 2015 5 it is not the practice of the court to order costs in relation to the voluntary attendance of parties at a judicial settlement conference and no authority or basis for departing from such an approach was identified. 6 referring to the general approach to costs in this court and citing eastern bay independent industrial workers union inc v pedersen industries ltd ac11a/09 27 april 2009 in support of her submission that no costs ought to be ordered inthe defendant’s favour.

[2] there is no appearance today by mr dixon or by counsel instructed by him. ms fitzherbert has received no further communication from mr dixon nor has there been any communication by mr dixon to the court. in those circumstances ms fitzherbert requests that the court make the orders sought in the application dated 28 may 2015. [3] the application is supported by an affidavit of detective senior sergeant b a murray who is the manager of the central and southern asset recovery unit in the new zealand police and an affidavit of mr g r beattie, a financial investigator attached to the central asset recovery unit. [4] in short it is apparent from their evidence that mr dixon was involved in a “muling” operation involving the smuggling of cash. in a video interview with the police mr dixon admitted that he received money from a person he refused to name and that he was to take the money for a “run” to wellington. a copy of the transcript of the video interview was annexed to the affidavit of mr beattie. [5] detective sergeant murray expresses the view on the basis of the evidence that mr dixon was clearly acting as a cash smuggling “mule” for an unknown drug syndicate. [6] on the basis of the evidence adduced it is my view that the property specified in the application, namely cash to the value of $49,900, is tainted property and that mr dixon has unlawfully benefited from significant criminal activity. accordingly the grounds are established for the orders sought in the application dated 28 may 2015. [7] an order is made in terms of the draft order lodged by the applicant. _______________________ brown j solicitors: ben vanderkolk & associates, crown solicitors, palmerston north

[2] the reason for the request is stated as being: 1 high court rules, r 3.13. [foundation life (nz) limited] is dealing with matters in relation to [its] business in respect of which it would be helpful for them to understand in more detail the demutualisation (and we understand the relevant documents would have been filed with the court)[.] [3] it is also said that as tower corporation was the only party to the proceedings it is unlikely that any other person will be adversely affected by this application. [4] the file to which access is sought was transferred to archives new zealand sometime in 2003. it has a “restricted access” classification.2 archives new zealand has provided the file to this court to determine whether access may be granted. [5] the difficulties for the court are the very general nature of the request and the large size of the file to which access is sought.3 it will take some time for the court to review the file to determine whether there are confidentiality or other reasons why access should not be granted in whole or in part. that tower was the only party to the proceeding does not necessarily make it unlikely that any other person will be adversely affected. it is not clear what other avenues foundation life (nz) limited may have for obtaining the information it seeks and what steps it has taken to do so. [6] if foundation life (nz) limited wishes to pursue its application, it should provide further information setting out in more detail the reason for its request and what other avenues it has explored for obtaining the information. it should also make inquiries to determine whether the court file is likely to have information that, if disclosed, will adversely affect any other person. i note, for example, that the court received a report from kpmg as an independent expert. the court also received submissions from peter jenkin qc as amicus curiae. it may be that these parties could assist foundation life (nz) limited with that issue. [7] in the meantime the application for general access to the file is declined. the matter can be revisited if foundation life (nz) limited provides the further information sought. 2 public records act 2005, s 43. 3 see for example schenker ag v commerce commission [2013] nzca 114, (2013) 22 prnz 286. mallon j

[2] an application has been filed for permission to commence the proceeding by originating application upon the grounds that there is no defendant in the proceeding, the proceeding involves a matter of urgency and it is in the interests of justice to permit the proceeding to be commenced by originating application. i grant permission under hcr 19.5 for the proceeding to be brought by originating application. estate of james thomas kett [2015] nzhc 2071 [28 august 2015] [3] the property at 3 jubilee court, palmerston north (“the property”) is owned as to one half share by desiree mary kett and as to the other half share by the trustees of the james thomas kett estate, namely desiree mary kett, david jonathan kett and james kett. the property is the subject of an agreement for sale and purchase which as earlier noted has a date of settlement of 4 september 2015. [4] unfortunately desiree mary kett is incapable of executing the necessary documentation in connection with the sale of the property. her present mental incapacity is evidenced by a statement from her doctor dated 27 august 2015 annexed to the affidavit of david jonathan kett. [5] although desiree kett executed an enduring power of attorney on 9 april 2015, the power of attorney relates only to her personal property affairs and does not extend to her role as trustee. consequently, in order to effect the transfer of the property an order is sought vesting in david jonathan kett and james kett the one half share of the property presently registered in the names of all three trustees of the james thomas kett estate. [6] having considered the originating application dated 27 august 2015 and the affidavit of david jonathan kett also dated 27 august 2015 and the annexures thereto, i am satisfied that it is appropriate to make an order under s 52 of the trustee act 1956.

[3] at the time the bail application was filed, the appeal did not have a hearing date and it was assumed to be some considerable time away. however, the court has been able to provide an early hearing date of 2 september 2015. in my view, in those circumstances, the concerns raised by her counsel lose much of their force. further, while i am obviously not in a position to attempt any extensive analysis of the merits of the appeal, on the limited information before me i would not necessarily endorse mr gotlieb’s assessment of them as falling in the “very strong” category so as to justifybail.

[2] mrverschaffelt’s application contends that wemisapprehended his criticism of the way in which the crown case was presented at trial. his concern is that we 1 see r v smith [2003]3 nzlr 617(ca) at [36]. 2 verschaffelt v r [2015] nzca53. verschaffeltv rca568/2014[2015] nzca354 [5august 2015] focused on the prospect of prejudice arising from a change in that the crown opening was on the basis that mrverschaffelt was liable as a principal, whereas the crown closed on the basis that mrverschaffelt was a party to the manufacture of methamphetamine at his residential address. however, the concern was rather that a shift had occurred from an allegation that mrverschaffelt was either a principal in the manufacture together with his co-defendant, mr atkinson, or a party to the manufacture by mratkinson, to an allegation that both messrs verschaffelt and atkinson might be found liable as parties to manufacture by third persons who were not before the court. [3] however, mrcassidy’s submissions in support ofthe appeal acknowledged that the crown opened on the basis that the two accused were either involved in the manufacture of methamphetamine at the address themselves, or allowed and facilitated others to use the address for that purpose. there can be no suggestion that mrverschaffelt’s defence was taken bysurprise when the crown case was closed, consistently with that indication in opening. [4] nor is there any merit in mr cassidy’s complaint that a lack of clarity as to the basis or bases for the crown’s case led him into error in assessing the admissibilityoftext messages between theco-defendants and others. thatpoint was considered and rejected in our judgment.3 [5] accordingly, the application for recall of the judgment in [2015] nzca 53 issued on 10 march 2015 is declined. solicitors: public defence service, manukau forappellant crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent at [11]–[15].

[4] with respect to the second point, mr shaw says in substance that the maori appellate court made a sensible and obvious decision in the exercise of discretion. however, there is a question whether the maori land court had jurisdiction to make the original roadway order and, if not, whether the order could be sustained on appeal to the maori appellate court. it cannot be said that the appeal is hopeless.

[3] mr creser has filed yet another application for recall. to a large extent, this application is on the same grounds as the previous recall applications. as such it is an abuse of process. [4] mr creser also seeks to raise allegations of bias against members of the court and makes an application for joinder of brandons lawyers, a wellington-based law firm. no reason is given why these allegations were not raised at the time of the leave application or why the application for joinder of brandons lawyers was only made at this stage. it is not acceptable to raise on a third recall application matters that could have been raised earlier.3 [5] as to the allegations of bias, mr creser now says that o’regan j had a conflict of interest because his brother is a principal of brandons lawyers, the last solicitor on the record acting for the first respondent. the first respondent was, however, not represented before cooper j or before this court.4 [6] mr creser also alleges that all three of the members of the court are biased, apparently on the basis that the members of the court have decided cases against mrcreser in the past and also that mr creser’s arguments in his previous applications in this matter were not accepted. neither of these grounds constitute bias or an appearance of bias. result [7] the applicant’s third application for recall is dismissed.

[3] the court of appeal rejected an appeal against sentence and conviction.1 the applicant now seeks leave to appeal in this court against conviction. the proposed appeal relates to two particular aspects of the case: (a) the complainant had worked in a brothel as a prostitute between 2009 and the winter of 2010. at trial defence counsel was not permitted to cross-examine her as to this. (b) the crown called propensity evidence from a young woman whom the applicant had picked up three weeks earlier as she was walking home in the early hours of the morning. on her evidence, the applicant made sexual advances, offered to pay for sex and would not stop the car to let her out. she escaped by grabbing the gear lever, putting the car into park and running off. the applicant tried to grab her and then followed her in his car but she was able to evade him. [4] on the first issue, the court of appeal concluded2 that the case fell to be determined under s 44(1) and (3) of the evidenceact 2006 as relating to prior sexual experience; disagreeing on this point with the trial judge who had seen s 44(2) (dealing with sexual reputation) as primarily applicable.3 the court accepted that the complainant’s prior experience as a prostitute was relevant to the defence that the sexual activity which occurred was consensual and for money.4 but given the time which had elapsed since the complainant had worked as a prostitute and the differences between that work (which was in a brothel and thus a controlled 1 sahib v r [2015] nzca112 (stevens,asher andwilliams jj) [sahib (ca)] 2 at [22]. 3 r v sahib dchamiltoncri-2011-019-5616,11 february2014 (judge marshall) at [30]. 4 sahib (ca), above n1, at [24]. environment) and what was alleged by the applicant, it saw the relevance of the evidence as marginal and concluded that the s 44(3) test was not met.5 [5] a ruling in the district court that the propensity evidence was admissible was the subject of an unsuccessful challenge in the court ofappeal prior to the final disposition of the trial.6 in the post-trial appeal to which we have referred, the court ofappeal saw the propensity evidence as tending to show that the applicant had the tendency of taking advantage of young women by inviting them into his car at night and persisting with sexual activity despite evident lack of consent.7 [6] the applicant challenges the approach taken to s 44 and, as well, the court of appeal’s analysis of the propensity evidence and its relevance and maintains that in any event that the prosecutor at trial put too much weight on the propensity evidence and that the directions given by the judge to the jurywere inadequate. [7] the case raises no question of general principle. rather what is in issue is the way in which accepted principles were applied. [8] we see no appearance of a miscarriage of justice: (a) the approach of the court of appeal to s 44 was orthodox and unsurprising in the result arrived at. (b) on her evidence, the propensity witness was in effect kidnapped (in that the applicant would not let her out of the car) and pursued byhim when she managed to get away in a context in which the applicant was making unwelcome sexual advances to her. the circumstances were remarkably similar to those involving the offending against the complainant which occurred onlythreeweeks later. there arevarious ways in which the relevance of the propensity evidence could be explained and we are not persuaded that there is an apparent error in 5 at [25]–[30]. 6 sahib v r [2013] nzca231. 7 sahib (ca), above n1, at [39]. the wayin which it was analysed bythe court of appeal8 or advanced at trial by the prosecutor. (c) the directions of the judge were positioned sub-optimally as they were given in the part of the summing up which dealt with the crown case. but they dealt with the relevance of the propensity evidence appropriately. the defence contentions were put and an appropriate warning was given. solicitors: cookmorris quinn,auckland forapplicant crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent at [35]–[40]. it is true that the interactions between the applicant and the propensity witness did not get as far as actual sexual activity but given that the context involved unwelcome sexual overtures and was an effective kidnapping, we have no difficulty with the use by the court of appeal ofthe phrase “sexual activity”.
in the high court of new zealand wellington registry civ-2014-485-11276 [2015] nzhc 1659 under part 5 of the insolvency act 2009 in the matter of a proposal made by stephen john edward pack between stephen john edward pack insolvent and ultra projects limited (in liquidation) objector teleconference: 16 july 2015 counsel: m freeman for the insolvent j c d corry for the objector judgment: 16 july 2015 judgment (no. 2) of associate judge smith [1] on 30 june 2015 mr pack’s counsel filed a memorandum inviting me to revisit the order for costs made in the judgment which i gave on 6 may 2015, in which i declined a proposal which mr pack had put to his creditors. [2] in the memorandum, counsel drew to my attention additional evidence (in the form of a letter dated 23 june 2015 from a firm of solicitors who have acted for mr pack and/or the ss pack family trust) showing that a debt which i had taken to be owing by mr pack’s family trust to mr pack, which was not disclosed by him in the proposal put to his creditors, had in fact been forgiven by the trust. [3] having considered the solicitors’ letter of 23 june 2015, i accept that what appeared to have been an undisclosed asset of mr pack was not in fact an stephen john edward pack v ultra projects limited (in liquidation) [2015] nzhc 1659 [16 july 2015] undisclosed asset. the judgment was accordingly in error to the extent that it found that mr pack had wrongly failed to disclose to his creditors a substantial asset. [4] however the circumstances do not justify recalling the judgment, and mr pack and his counsel have not asked me to do so. any error in the judgment lay in my drawing an inference from the evidence which, as circumstances have now shown, was not justified. that would have been a matter for appeal, not recall of the judgment. [5] i add that if i had been informed that the advances from mr pack to the trust had been forgiven, the result of the application for approval of the proposal would have been the same. the issue relating to the net value of the debts (discussed at paras [82]-[87] of the judgment), and the reasons for my finding that it would have been inexpedient to approve the proposal (set out at paras [88]-[93] of the judgment), each provided a sufficient basis for the decision. [6] in his memorandum, counsel for mr pack invited the court to confirm its order declining to approve the proposal, but submitted that the court might (in light of the matters disclosed in the memorandum) consider that costs should not be awarded, or should be ordered in a reduced sum. [7] i do not see any basis for reducing the costs award. there was no increase in the amount of costs awarded against mr pack because of his apparent failure to disclose a significant asset – the costs were awarded on the normal 2b basis, and remain justified on the basis that the objector was successful with his objection. [8] in the result, the judgment issued on 6 may 2015 stands. there is no basis for recall, whether on the substantive merits or on the question of costs. associate judge smith
in the high court of new zealand wellington registry civ 2014-442-24 [2015] nzhc 1664 between nelson city council plaintiff and the yacht pounamu defendant hearing: on papers counsel: m j logan for plaintiff judgment: 16 july 2015 judgment (no 2) of brown j [1] in my judgment of 17 april 20151 i made an order in the terms sought that the yacht pounamu be appraised and sold by way of public tender or, if no satisfactory bids were received by way of tender, by private treaty. i reserved leave to the plaintiff to apply for further directions should that be required. [2] in a memorandum dated 16 july 2015 counsel for the plaintiff advises that the registrar has obtained quotations from two vessel brokers in nelson, both of whom will charge $3,000 to conduct the tender process. because the vessel has now been valued as having a market value between $12,000 and $15,000, the tender cost would be a substantial portion of the potential sale value. [3] however one of the brokers has indicated that he has a private client who may be interested in purchasing the vessel. a private treaty sale would have the advantage of avoiding the cost and delay associated with the tender process. accordingly the plaintiff seeks a further direction to permit the pounamu to be sold either by way of private treaty or public tender. 1 nelson city council v the yacht pounamu [2015] nzhc 752. [4] i agree that the circumstances are such that a more flexible order is appropriate allowing for sale by private treaty or public tender in the alternative. consequently the order at [19] of my earlier judgment is amended to read as follows: [19] the court makes an order that the defendant vessel, pounamu, be appraised and sold either by way of private treaty or public tender.

[2] in preparation for settlement of historical claims, the various iwi of ngati ranginui agreed a process for settling internal disputes. this was called the mana whenua agreement. it was contemplated the process would be used subsequent to settlement with the crown. as it happens, all relevant disputes were apparently determined prior to settlement. as the judgment records, the mana whenua agreement was not therefore included amongst the final settlement documentation. [3] paragraph [53] of the judgment records that the mana whenua agreement is no longer available. it is this observation the appellants seek to have recalled. they wish in subsequent litigation to argue the agreement is still operative. a footnote which precedes the paragraph in issue notes that the judgment proceeds on the basis of the position as it presently stands. it was recognised that there may be further litigation about the processes that were followed, and the observation was made that the present judgment is not intended to indicate a view on the merits of any future litigation. [4] we agree with the respondent that the criteria for recall as set out in horowhenua county v nash (no 2) are not met. 2 no special reason exists requiring recall. the judgment is plain that it records the present situation, and the statement in para [53] was acceptance of a specific argument advanced to the court by mr cooke qc on behalf of the respondent. recall is not the appropriate vehicle for any challenge to the statement.

[2] applications to recall are granted only on limited grounds, as this court confirmed in saxmere co ltd v wool board disestablishment co ltd (no 2).2 the only ground that might apply here is that “for some other very special reason justice requires that the judgment be recalled”. 1 deliu v new zealand law society [2015] nzsc 75. 2 saxmere co ltd v wool board disestablishment co ltd (no 2) [2009] nzsc 122, [2010] nzlr 76 at [2], citing horowhenua county v nash (no 2) [1968] nzlr 632 at 633. see also erwood v maxted [2010] nzca 93, (2010) 20 prnz 466, at [23]. francisc catalin deliu v the new zealand law society [2015] nzsc 100 [14 july 2015] [3] in his written submissions in support of his application for leave to appeal, mr deliu accepted that the court had a rationale for its decisions on costs, but noted that it had not always given reasons for differing awards of costs. mr deliu referred to this court’s decision in manukau golf club inc v shoye venture ltd,3 before concluding: so, if leave is to be denied me and costs are awarded against me there is nothing to indicate this is not arbitrary. i do not make this allegation, but rather submit the lack of any reasoning process when ordering (or not ordering) costs leaves parties completely uncertain and advocates unable to cogently advise their clients of litigation risks and as such is wrong. [4] as this extract indicates, mr deliu well understood that he was at risk of an award of costs if his application was unsuccessful. moreover, his reference to manukau golf club inc v shoye venture ltd indicates that he was aware of the general principle applying to awards of costs, namely that in the normal course, costs follow the event and, where they are within the normal range, no reasons are required. mr deliu’s case fell within that category and there was no suggestion that it did not. the fact that in other cases no awards are made, whether with or without reasons, does not affect this analysis. [5] mr deliu has raised nothing which causes us to reconsider what is said in our earlier judgment. accordingly, his application for recall is dismissed. solicitors: glaister ennor, auckland for respondent manukau golf club inc v shoye venture ltd [2012] nzsc 109, [2013] 1 nzlr 305.

[3] i hereby order specific performance of the agreement, subject to the following conditions: (a) the purchase price is to be reduced by any amount paid or still payable to the first defendant under the mortgage which was transferred pursuant to the earlier decision of duffy j; and (b) of any amount to be paid to the second defendant, the first $200,000 is to be placed in the trust account of the second defendant's solicitor, to be held on trust until the determination of the compensation claim. [4] i grant leave to any party to apply for any fmther orders necessary to give effect to this judgment. .
in the court of appeal of new zealand ca345/2015 [2015] nzca 291 between gavin john tuira applicant and the queen respondent counsel: applicant in person m wong for respondent judgment: 9 july 2015 at 11 am (on the papers) bail judgment of wild j the application for bail pending appeal is dismissed. reasons [1] mr tuira applies for bail pending the determination of an appeal against conviction and sentence which he filed on 18 june 2015. [2] mr tuira was sentenced to preventive detention by faire j in the high court at hamilton on 10 march 2015 after he pleaded guilty to charges of injuring with intent, aggravated burglary, assault with a weapon and indecent assault. [3] mr tuira’s notice of appeal indicates that he is not legally represented and does not intend to apply for legal aid. [4] in his somewhat immoderate handwritten application, mr tuira indicates he seeks bail so he “can seek advice how to go about charging the police the courts tuirav r ca345/2015[2015] nzca291 [9 july2015] and all who represented me after i dismissed them for cheating me off my freedom …”. [5] the application for bail pendingappeal is declined. briefly, my reasons are: (a) the appeal lacks merit. the grounds of appeal against conviction appear to be an allegation that the police, courts, his lawyers and the prosecution conspired to have him falsely charged. no grounds for the appeal against sentence are discernible: s 14(3)(a) bailact 2000. (b) no hearing date for the appeal has yet been fixed. but, given that mrtuira is serving a sentence of preventive detention, the likely delay to the hearing of the appeal will not render it nugatory: ss 14(3)(b) and (c). (c) as already mentioned, mr tuira wants bail so he can take advice about suing those he holds responsible for his incarceration. as to seeking advice, i note mr tuira chose to represent himself when he was sentenced. faire j’s sentencing remarks record mr tuira dispensing with the services of two successive counsel after he had entered his pleas of guilty, during what was obviously a rather protracted sentencing procedure. that is not a proper ground for the grant of bail. further, the two psychological assessment reports provided to faire j upon sentencing both assessed mr tuira as at high risk of sexual or violent reoffending if released into the community: s 14(3)(d). solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent
in the court of appeal of new zealand ca243/2014 [2015] nzca 296 between sos investments limited appellant and fm custodians limited respondent hearing: 8 july 2015 court: miller, lang and wylie jj counsel: r j katz qc forappellant r b stewart qc and n l penman-chambers for respondent judgment: 8 july 2015 at 11.11 am oral judgment of the court the court makes the unless order referred to in paragraph [5]. if it is not complied with, the appeal will be dismissed without further hearing. if it is complied with, the timetable directions in paragraph [6] apply. reasons of the court (given bymiller j) [1] this is an appeal against refusal of summary judgment. it was made clear before the hearing that the appellant company, which had filed its own submissions and whose solicitor was given leave to withdraw, must appear by counsel at the hearing. [2] at the hearing today mr katz qc appeared to seek an adjournment. he has only just been instructed and is in no position to argue the appeal on its merits. he anticipates that he will be briefed for the appeal by an instructing solicitor, but he does not presently have one. [3] the attitude of the respondent is that it wishes to proceed but would prefer a short adjournment to the alternative, which is likely to involve further procedural difficulties. a fixture is available on 29 july in wellington. [4] it must be said that this situation is profoundly unsatisfactory and to grant an adjournment is to extend a considerable indulgence to the appellant, which has failed to explain at all its default in briefing counsel. [5] under r 48 ofthe court of appeal rules this court on the hearingofan appeal has all the powers and duties of the high court concerning procedure. that includes the making of unless orders. having regard to the appellant’s conduct, we think it is appropriate to make such an order as a condition of an adjournment. we require that new zealand solicitors confirm to the registrar that they will become solicitors on the record and will instruct mr katz and will protect him for his fee on the hearing of the appeal. we require also that costs of $1500 be paid for today’s adjournment. unless both of those steps are undertaken by 5 pm on friday the appeal will be dismissed without further hearing. [6] assuming the unless order is complied with, mr katz must file his submissions by 17 july. mr stewart must file his submissions in response by 24 july. the hearing will be held on 29 july at wellington at a time to be fixed by the registrar. counsel may appear by video if it is not convenient to appear in wellington.
in the high court of new zealand hamilton registry civ-2014-419-0353 [2015] nzhc 1563 under the companies act 1993 between fairway resolution limited (formerly dispute resolution services limited) applicant and ian henson respondent hearing: 4 may 2015 (on papers submission from applicant) appearances: ms d bennington for theapplicant judgment: 7 july 2015 costs judgment of associate judge j p doogue this judgment was delivered by me on 07.07.15 at 4 pm, pursuant to rule 11.5 of the high court rules. registrar/deputy registrar date…………… fairwayresolution limited (formerlydispute resolution services limited) v henson [2015] nzhc 1563[7 july2015] [1] submissions have been filed by counsel for the applicant in support of an application for the court to fix costs in its favour following the hearing and issue of judgment dated 29april 2015. [2] the key issue is that the application to set aside the statutory demand related to a notice that was the same as one which mr henson had previously issued in 2013. mr henson withdrew that demand after being served with an application to set it aside. the fact that mr henson withdrew the very same statutory demand on an earlier occasion before re-issuing it indicates, at the very least, that he has taken an unmeritorious position. i agree with counsel for the applicant that he was in breach of r 14.6(3)(b)(ii). i also accept that it is at least arguable that he acted in such a way to attract an award of indemnity costs under r 14.6(4) for acting “vexatiously, frivolously, improperly or unnecessarily…”. [3] however, having regard to the fact that if an indemnity costs order were made mr henson would end up paying in excess of $32,000 i take the view that making such an order is not an attractive outcome. although i have no information concerning mr henson’s financial circumstances my judgment is based upon the material that was placed before the court by evidence on the hearing of the application that he is not a man of extensive means. overall i consider that fairness between the parties can be achieved by awarding scale 2b costs with an uplift of 50% for a total of $18,139.50. that figure includes disbursements. the order of the court is accordingly that mr henson is to pay the sum of $18,139.50 in costs. j.p. doogue associate judge

[2] the view i take is that a broad approach should be taken as to which part has failed which is a relevant matter to take into account pursuant to r 14.2. i do not consider that fine-grained analyses of the extent by which the party failed are called for under the rules. to take such an approach would derivate from the principle stated at r 14.2(g) that so far as possible the determination of costs should be predictable and expeditious. [3] if the court were to exceed to such an approach it would also be put in a position of having to make a decision supplementary to the main decision determining which debts were legitimately claimed for and which not. i do not consider that it is feasible for the court to resolve those sort of disputes when considering an application to set aside a statutorydemand. [4] the terms of s 290(4) of the company’s act 1993 direct the court to determine whether there is a substantial dispute whether or not the debt is owing or due. i do not consider that it also requires the court to go on and determine, in the event that the conclusion is that there is a substantial debt, how much of the debt claimed was due. [5] for those reasons i accept the submissions of the applicant and approve the 2b costs set out in the schedule annexed to ms cooper’s memorandum. j.p. doogue associate judge
in the high court of new zealand palmerston north registry cri-2015-054-617 [2015] nzhc 1567 the queen v scott gareth simmonds hearing: 6 july 2015 counsel: m m wilkinson-smith for the crown p l murray and a c whittaker for the defendant judgment: 6 july 2015 oral judgment of mackenzie j solicitors: crown solicitors, palmerston north r v simmonds [2015] nzhc 1567 [6 july 2015] [1] this is an application for variation of electronically monitored bail. bail was initially granted by me on 25 march 2015. the applicant is on a 24-hour curfew to the bail address which is in upper hutt. the application seeks a relaxation of the 24-hour curfew to permit absences from the bailed address for a period of two hours a day and the hours of 1 pm and 3 pm are suggested. [2] the crown opposes the variation on the grounds that it is concerned at the prospect of reoffending on bail. the crown case against the applicant involves the proposition that his involvement in the alleged offending was at the behest of others and the encouragement of others. the crown submits that there is a risk of association with those involved, or that he may be led into offending while on bail. [3] the trial is set down for may 2016, so it is still some distance away. there has been no breach of the bail which has now been in force for over three months. counsel advises that there have been approved absences, which have included travelling to palmerston north, without incident. [4] a 24-hour curfew is difficult and the court needs to be mindful of that difficulty when considering this application. the variation sought is quite modest and will enable the position to be monitored to ensure that there is no breach. consider that the period of two hours a day which is sought is appropriate. i would confine that in the first instance to week days, monday to friday of each week, to enable the matter to be assessed and perhaps reconsidered in the future. but that will be a matter for the future. [5] the application is allowed, to the extent that the permitted absences between 1pm and 3 pm are allowed, on monday to friday of each week. the conditions of bail are varied accordingly. “a d mackenzie j”
in the high court of new zealand wellington registry civ-2015-485-000513 [2015] nzhc 1569 in the matter of an appeal under s 42 of the financial service providers (registration and dispute resolution) act 2008 between vivier and company limited appellant and the financial markets authority respondent hearing: 6 july 2015 counsel: a n riches and v a nichols for appellant m t scholtens qc and a r lynes for respondent judgment: 6 july 2015 judgment of collins j [interim relief] [1] vivier and company ltd (vivier) is registered on the financial service providers register. [2] on 26 june 2015, the financial markets authority (fma) directed the registrar of financial service providers to deregister vivier from the financial service providers register. [3] vivier has filed a notice of appeal under s 42 of the financial service providers (registration and dispute resolution) act 2008 (the act). [4] vivier has sought a stay of the fma’s decision pending the hearing of its appeal. that application is made under s 43 of the act, which provides: vivier and co ltd v the financial markets authority [2015] nzhc 1569 [6 july 2015] unless the high court orders otherwise, a decision [or direction] appealed against under section 42 continues in effect. [5] ms scholtens qc had only received instructions earlier today and properly advised that the fma could neither consent or oppose vivier’s application. [6] i have arranged for the stay to be heard on 21 july 2015. in the meantime, i will issue a temporary stay in order to ensure vivier’s appeal is not rendered nugatory. 1 this is because the effect of the fma’s decision is that vivier is no longer registered and it is reasonably arguable vivier is likely to suffer serious harm if it is unable to be registered at least until its application for a stay can be fully heard and determined. [7] i accordingly issue a stay under s 43 of the act and direct the registrar of financial service providers to reinstate vivier on the financial service providers register until further order of this court. unless i make this order the stay is futile. [8] vivier’s substantial appeal will be heard on 24 august 2015. i am advising the parties of this hearing date so that if a timetable direction is required, the parties can submit memoranda to me this week for consideration. d b collins j solicitors: saunders & co lawyers, christchurch for appellant philip morris (new zealand) ltd v liggett [1977] 2 nzlr 41 (ca); duncan v osborne buildings ltd (1992) 6 prnz 85 (ca).

[2] the grant of leave does not extend to the point raised in para 4.11 of the submissions for the applicants relating to fees charged to the first applicant by the second applicant and passed on by the first applicant to debtors. we do not consider the statutory criteria are met in relation to that issue and the difficulties identified in the court of appeal arising from the point not being raised in the high court would also arise in this court if leave were granted. solicitors: dla piper, auckland for applicants meredith connell, wellington for respondent did the court of appeal err in finding that it had been established that the debtors had suffered loss or damage for the purposes of s 94 of the credit contracts and consumer finance act 2003.

[2] as well as applying for leave to appeal to this court, the applicant also appealedto the court ofappeal. he has,however, been required to pay securityfor costs. in support of the contention that we should grant leave to appeal direct to this court, he asserted in his leave application that the “oppressive security for costs regime” will prevent him appealing to the court of appeal.3 we assume therefore that he does not propose to provide security. [3] the application does not meet the criteria specified in s 14 of the supreme court act 2003. theproposed appeal does not involve amatterof general orpublic importance and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice. we are not satisfied that it is in the interests of justice for this court to hear and determine the proposed appeal. as well, there are no exceptional circumstances that would justify an appeal to this court. solicitors: meredithconnell,wellingtonfor first respondent 2 re judicial conduct commissioner [2014] nzhc 2712. 3 the argument that leave should be granted for direct appeal from the high court because of the requirement to pay security for costs in the court of appeal was rejected in siemer v brown [2015] nzsc 41 at [4]–[6].
in the high court of new zealand wellington registry civ-2015-485-345 [2015] nzhc 1502 under the trustee act 1956 in the matter of the estate of james mitchell brockie between deborah elsie heke plaintiff and glenda julie brockie defendant on papers judgment: 1 july 2015 judgment of dobson j [1] the statement of claim in this proceeding seeks an order under s 51 of the trustee act 1956 appointing the public trust as sole trustee in place of deborah elsie heke and glenda julie brockie, the trustees appointed under the will of the late james mitchell brockie. the statement of claim also seeks an order vesting in the public trust the remaining funds of the estate, and directing that the remaining funds be paid to the public trust for that purpose. [2] the court has previously directed that service be effected on ms brockie by email at her known email address, glenda.besttaxi@gmail.com, and also by service on solicitors, bruce young of wellington and maude & miller of porirua. there is now evidence of service by those means. [3] there has been no response from ms brockie, although an email reaction to a letter foreshadowing the present action was dispatched from her email address to mr young and mr langford, separate wellington solicitors who appear to have acted heke v brockie [2015] nzhc 1502 [1 july 2015] for her. that communication indicated opposition to the proposed retirement of the existing trustees and appointment of the public trust. it included: this attachment [the deed of retirement and appointment of trustees] will not be auctioned [sic] or even considered by myself until the other issues and estate bills are paid, one being the ird returns for dad’s estate. again i say get real people. step up and take responsibility for your actions and sort these issues out honestly. that’s my final word. [4] in the absence of a response to the proceedings, the court accepts the state of impasse as pleaded in the statement of claim. that renders the retirement of existing trustees and appointment of the public trust an appropriate step. subject to the conditions described below, that relief will be granted. [5] there remains a practical prospect that ms brockie is unaware of the consequences of not taking a step in the proceedings. accordingly, the retirement of the present trustees and appointment of the public trust as the replacement trustee is subject to solicitors for the plaintiff ensuring that all documents relevant to the estate and any difference between the plaintiff and ms brockie in relation to its administration are provided to the public trust, together with the records held by maude & miller in relation to their acting in the estate thus far. [6] the public trust is charged with seeking an indication of views from ms brockie before administering the balance of the estate, and to that extent leave is reserved for the public trust to apply for directions if that becomes appropriate. [7] there will be no order as to costs on these proceedings. dobson j solicitors: greg kelly law, wellington for plaintiff

[5] therespondent had sought to use the s 145aprovisions ofthe land transfer act 1952 as a way of enforcing advice as to the amount required to settle the mortgage from the applicant bank. the caveat approach adopted, clearly, is not the correct way to deal with that problem. [6] the applicant is successful in this case. i see no reason to depart from the normal position required by r 14.2(a), namely that the person who fails with respect to an application should paycosts to the party who succeeds.

[2] this application is an abuse of process. we make two points. first, as the court said in deliu v new zealand law society, costs normally follow the event.3 where that occurs, and the costs awarded are within the normal range, no reasons are 1 siemer v o’brien [2015] nzsc 13. this is mr siemer’s third application for recall of that judgment. 2 siemer v o’brien [2015] nzsc79. 3 deliu v new zealand law society [2015] nzsc 75. vincentross siemer vclare o'brien [2015] nzsc89 [23 june2015] required.4 of necessity, the attorney-general had to intervene in the present proceedings as the first respondent, who is the registrar of the court of appeal, abided the decisions of the courts, and a contradictor was required. counsel for the attorney-general filed written submissions opposing mr siemer’s application for leave to appeal. the court declined mr siemer’s application. in those circumstances, mr siemer was at risk of an award of costs against him, in accordance with the normal practice. given his extensive experience in this court, mr siemerought to have been well aware of that. [3] second, mr siemer has attempted to raise in a sequence of recall applications points that could and should have been raised in the first application. a party seeking recall of a judgment must raise all points in support of the application together: where the points raised could have been raised at the outset, serial attempts at recall of the same judgment are an abuse of process. [4] theapplication for recall is dismissed. there is no order for costs. [5] the registrar is directed not to accept any further applications for recall from mr siemer in relation to this matter. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellington for respondents at [7].

[2] his application for habeas corpus was dismissed by mander j1 and his subsequent appeal from that judgment was dismissed by the court of appeal.2 he now seeks leave to appeal from the latter decision. 1 genge v superintendent of christchurch men’s prison [2014] nzhc 705 [genge (hc)]. 2 genge v chief executive of the department of corrections [2015] nzca157 [genge (ca)]. richard lyallgenge v chief executive ofthe departmentof corrections[2015] nzsc 88 [22 june 2015] [3] in his application and other material provided by the applicant, he complained about the hearing he was accorded in the court of appeal. he also has indicated that he has some concerns as to parole. in a letter of 31 may however, he advised that he had obtained legal advice to the effect that in the context of the present application, this court is the “wrong forum” for the ventilation of his parole concerns. he asked that the proceedings “be changed from habeas corpus to a judicial review, to be heard in a lower court”. however, the applicant subsequently wrote a further letter (of 10 june) indicating a desire to pursue his application. [4] as the applicant was advised, the present proceedings do not provide an appropriate context for consideration of parole issues. [5] the judgments of the high court and court of appeal adequately explain why the applicant’s detention is still authorised by the 1995 warrant notwithstanding the repeal of thecriminal justiceact.3 ifthe applicant’s submissions in thecourt of appeal were curtailed as he claims, that is unsurprising given the obvious validity of his detention. the proposed appeal raises no question of law of public or general importance and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent genge (hc) at [14]–[16] and genge (ca) at [8]–[23].

[2] costs would ordinarily follow the event. in the usual course, mrs clayton would be entitled to costs on a 2b basis. mr clayton resists costs on the ground that since june 2014 he has paid a total of $309,019 by way of maintenance ($110,000), court costs ($129,019) and an interim distribution of relationship property ($70,000). in these circumstances he contends that a further award is inappropriate. [3] the provision for legal costs in the maintenance order was made in order to equip mrs clayton to resolve the complex relationship property litigation. the fact that she receives maintenance payments specificallyfor the purpose of meeting legal costs would be a factor to take into account in deciding whether there should be a departure from the rule of awarding costs to the successful party in the context of those proceedings. however, the current application concerns the maintenance proceedings. in these proceedings it is not appropriate to take into account the amount that mr clayton has paid by way of maintenance or by way of court costs in the relationship property proceedings. the litigation is to be treated on a normal stand-alone basis that attracts costs following the event. [4] there are to be costs in mrs clayton’s favour on a 2b basis. i do not, however, accept the reasons advanced for the higher costs claimed in ms hosking’s memoranda. thecostsareto beas per the relevant section ofschedule aattached to tompkins wake’s memorandum dated 12 may 2015. p courtney j clayton v clayton [2015] nzhc 550. other grounds of appeal were determined following a later hearing.

[2] the basis of the further application is that in the formal judgment of the court set out in the judgment band, mr siemer is ordered to pay the respondents 1 siemer v o’brien [2014] nzhc 2886. 2 siemer v o’brien [2015] nzsc 13. 3 siemer v o’brien [2015] nzsc 23. vincentross siemer vclare o'brien [2015] nzsc78 [5 june2015] (plural) costs of $2,500 plus reasonable disbursements, whereas in the body of the judgment the order is recorded as being that mr siemer paythe respondent (singular) costs of $2,500 plus reasonable disbursements. mr siemer submits that this makes the judgment “incomprehensible on the order of costs” and says that “there is no way of comprehending from reading the judgment as issued to whom costs were awarded in favour”. [3] obviously, there is a typographical error in the leave judgment, but it is one which is immaterial in the present case. as we recorded in the leave judgment, mrsiemer has issued judicial review proceedings in respect of certain decisions of the first respondent, whois the registrar ofthe court ofappeal. shehas not played an active part in the proceedings but, rather, has abided the courts’ decisions. accordingly, as commonly occurs in such situations, the attorney-general appeared before the high court to act as contradictor, and has maintained that role subsequently. given that the crown law office is the solicitor on the record for both respondents, mr siemer can meet his obligation to pay costs by paying the $2,500 plus reasonable disbursements to the office. [4] given that the error is immaterial, we see no reason to recall our judgment, but will re-issue it with the typographical error removed, by virtue of our implied power to correct such slips. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondents

[2] the application was supported by a comprehensive affidavit of mr stephen fisher, the current chairman of the spirit of adventure trust board. having read that affidavit and the supporting documents, i was satisfied that the order sought should be made. this was subject to two minor points, which are appropriately described as points of drafting. [3] the points of drafting have been clarified in a supplementary affidavit from mr fisher and a memorandum of counsel. [4] applying the provisions of s 64a of the trustee act and the principles developed in the cases i am satisfied that the application should now be granted. accordingly, there is an order approving the deed of variation and restatement of the terms of the spirit of adventure trust. the order is to be in the form filed on 29 may 2015. woodhouse j

[4] the parties have been able to agree on costs except on the issue of whether there should be an allowance for second counsel as claimed by the now successful respondent. [5] in our view, the claim for second counsel is not justified. this was a relatively simple appeal which turned essentially on its facts. it did not occupy significant hearing time.

[5] the defendant succeeded in defending the plaintiff's challenge. it has an interest in finality and a right to enjoy the fruits of its success. [6] i am not satisfied that it is appropriate for a stay to be granted and i decline to do so. [7] the defendant is entitled to costs on the application, the quantum of which is reserved.

[2] counsel for the parties have brought the court's attention to an error in that decision. at para [12], we said this: one needs to start with the relevant effects, if any, of existing activities ( or works/structures). possible adverse erosion effects on the teasdale land of the existing structures/work on the golf course are rated by both mr john philpott, the consulting engineer engaged by the golf club, and mr james flanagan, the council's engineer, as .. .no effect. mr hall ranks the risk as ... unlikely to be any measurable effect. [3] the last sentence is incorrect. mr hall, as recorded in the joint witness statement made by the three engineering witnesses, has the view that the existing works do have an effect on the teasdale land. [4] we very much regret, and apologise for, that error. we should make it clear however that the inadvertent misstatement of mr hall's position on the existing works does not alter our views on the ultimate outcome in respect of the proposed works, noting in particular mr hall's concession that the proposed works will be unlikely to cause an adverse effect, whether or not the existing works remain.

[2] under s 14 ofthe supreme court act 2003, the supreme court mustnot give leave to appeal directly to it against a decision made in a court other than the court of appeal unless (in addition to being satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of rabson v transparency international (new zealand) inc [2015] nzhc 334. malcom edward rabsonand richard john creser vtransparencyinternational (newzealand) incorporated [2015] nzsc 56[8may2015] justice for the court to hear and determine the proposed appeal) it is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances justifying taking the proposed appeal directly to this court. [3] the applicants argue that the underlying appeal is of significant public importance and that the exceptional circumstances for a direct appeal are reinforced by “an oppressive security for costs regime” which will prevent the applicants appealingagainst the judgment to the new zealand court ofappeal. [4] the fact an appeal may be of public importance is not an exceptional circumstance justifying a direct appeal to this court.2 as to security for costs, as this court stated in siemer v brown, it “is not appropriate to allow a leapfrog appeal to this court to circumvent the application of the rules applying to appeals to the court ofappeal, in particular, the requirement to pay securityfor costs”.3 [5] the application for leave to appeal is dismissed and costs of $2,500 are payable to the respondent. solicitors: chapmantripp,wellington for respondent 2 in any event, the respondent submits the underlying allegations that are the subject of the proceedings are trivial, moot and lack seriousness. 3 siemer v brown [2015] nzsc 41 at [6].

[2] i am satisfied that the application should be granted. i will state my reasons shortly. first, the appeal relates to proposals by the respondent to extend the bledisloe wharf into the waitemata harbour. in the broadest sense it can be described as genuine public interest litigation, relating to the stewardship and governance of public assets and the impact of the extension on the harbour and its users. [3] second, this is not a case in which the respondent needs the protection of security. it contends that the appellant has the means to pay costs. [4] third, it cannot be said that the appeal is without merit. i differ from the registrar on this point. the merits are difficult to assess. it is true that there appear to have been good practical reasons to deny interim relief, and the respondent has veryrecentlyoffered a compromise which its shareholder, the auckland council, has accepted. but it still proposes to proceed with part of the work (known as the b2 extension). it appears that work is under way. further, the substantive merits are relevant too, and the judgment under appeal does not engage them. it must be assumed, for present purposes, that the appeal has some merit. [5] for these reasons security for costs is waived. the appellant should not take this as an indication that she will escape costs, should the appeal fail. solicitors: cookmorris quinn,auckland forappellant russell mcveagh,auckland for respondent

[4] the proposed grounds of appeal are that (a) the court of appeal did not follow birchler v police4 and (b) that the court of appeal’s conclusion as to the lawfulness of the applicant’s detention was wrong. [5] the facts of the present case differ substantially from those of birchler (in which a required procedural step had not occurred at all). and in any event, on the findings of the court of appeal on the lawfulness of the detention, there was no deviation from the process required under the statute. the issue whether the delays rendered the detention of the applicant unlawful is very factual and does not raise a question of law of public or general importance. as well, there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent birchler v police [2010] nzsc 109, [2011] 1 nzlr 169.

[4] consequently under r 7.59 i appoint the official assignee as receiver to all the property owned by the respondent for the purpose of preserving the respondent’s assets pending the completion of the bankruptcy proceedings against mr groves. once the outcome of those proceedings are known the first applicant and the receiver are to bring the matter back before the court for further directions in the receivership.

[2] mr lyttelton has sought this order, saying that it is necessary for fair trial reasons that the judgment and any part of the proceedings be published in the news media or on the internet or on other publicly available database, so allowing fair news reporting of both the fact of the first trial and the fact of the retrial, as well as this court’s reasons. he says that it will allow him to openly discuss the appeal and the reasons for the retrial with members of the public with whom he will be dealing when preparing for the retrial. [3] the crown opposes the application, pointing out that the order does not preclude mr lyttelton talking to potential witnesses or friends or family and noting that his name is not suppressed.

[3] mrs howard submits that important constitutional issues in relation to access to justice are involved. among other things, she contends that in its decision in reekie v attorney-general,3 this court overlooked the implications of the magna carta. [4] in reekie, the court determined the principles applicable to securityfor costs. in doing so, it recognised (through the notion of the reasonable and solvent litigant) that impecuniosity should not stand in the way of an arguable appeal. in the present case, randerson j applied the approach set out in reekie, concluding that mrs howard’s appeal had little merit. mrs howard has not raised anything which satisfies us that randerson j’s conclusion is arguably wrong. [5] it follows that we are not satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice that we hear and determine mrs howard’s proposed appeal. no point of principle is involved and we see no risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. [6] the application for leave to appeal is dismissed. mrs howard must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent, plus reasonable disbursements. solicitors: mcbride davenport james,wellington for respondent 1 howard v accident compensation corporation [2014] nzhc 2431. the earlier review and appeal decisions in which mrs howard has been involved are summarised at [13]. 2 howard v accident compensation corporation [2014] nzca627. 3 reekie v attorney-general [2014] nzsc 63, [2014] nzlr 737.

[2] contrary to mr siemer’s assertions, the court did understand that his intended appeal sought to challenge the role of the attorney-general in the proceedings and addressed that point to the extent necessary. 1 siemer v o’brien [2015] nzsc 13. 2 siemer v o’brien [2015] nzhc 2886. vincentross siemer vclare o'brien [2015] nzsc23 [10 march 2015] [3] more fundamentally, as the court noted in its earlier judgment, where an applicant seeks to appeal directly to this court, by-passing the court of appeal, the applicant must, by virtue of s 14 of the supreme court act 2003, establish that there are exceptional circumstances justifying that course. the only explanation mrsiemer gave for his leave application was to avoid the “oppressive” security for costs regime in the court of appeal. obviously, that cannot qualify as an exceptional circumstance, so that his application for leave to appeal could not succeed in any event.

[3] the second application for leave was primarily addressed4 to the question whether the applicant had a right of review under s 61a(2) of the judicature act 1908 in respect of the judgment of french j, a proposition which was rejected in the 23 december judgment.5 that judgment did not expressly refer to judgment of french j as having been made under s 61a(3) but that this was the case was made clear byreference in the judgment to reekie v attorney-general.6 that french j was acting under s 61a(3) is apparent in the judgment she gave (which refers to r 7(2) of the court of appeal (civil) rules 20057 and is described as being a review of the deputy registrar’s decision).8 contrary to the contention of the applicant, the court was not mistaken as to the exercise carried out by french j (which is accurately described in the both the original leave judgment of 2 december and more succinctly in the first recall judgment of 23 december). and as explained in the 23 december judgment the reference to payment of security for costs was not in the nature of an order but rather an explanation of the position which resulted from the orders which french j had made. [4] accordingly the second application for recall is dismissed. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondents 4 there are other complaints: that the issue whether there was a s 61a(2) review was not before the court and that a separate file had not been created for the second application for leave. the first complaint is wrong as the applicant’s major concern was that the court of appeal was not according him what he mistakenly thought was his right to a s 61a(2) review. the second complaint is inconsequential. 5 23 december judgment, above n 3, at [3]. 6 reekie v attorney-general [2014] nzsc 63, [2014]1 nzlr 737 at [24]–[26]. 7 at [3]. 8 2 december judgment, above n 2, at [1].
