[2] now the question of costs falls to be determined. the commissioner seeks costs of $14,527, and disbursements of $1,207.26, based on scale 2b. there is no argument about the calculation. but the unsuccessful taxpayer says that costs should lie where they fall here. that is because this is an appeal from an authority which has a no costs rule, and the parties had mixed results before me (the appellant’s appeal on shortfall penalties having failed). 1 commissioner of inland revenue v john curtis developments ltd [2014] nzhc 3034, 28 november 2014. commissioner of inland revenue v john curtis developments limited [2015] nzhc 335 [3 march 2015] [3] in auckland gas co ltd v commissioner of inland revenue2 the court of appeal said:3 it is difficult to justify drawing on a no-costs rule, for what in most taxation review authority cases are relatively small-sum tax disputes, in determining the proper approach to costs in the dozen or so first instance cases heard in the high court each year where inevitably the stakes tend to be much higher. [4] although that case was not an appeal from the authority, i see no principled basis for extending the no costs regime in the authority to appeals in this court. no statutory or judicial authority in support of that approach was cited. neither necessary implication nor substantial procedural policy reasons command such variation from orthodoxy. had the commissioner failed before me, the taxpayer would have been the first to have sought costs. and it would then have deserved them. [5] in this case the appeal succeeded, and costs should follow the event in the ordinary way in this court. although the commissioner failed on the shortfall penalties argument, that was very much a secondary issue in the case. little time was spent on it. result [6] the commissioner will have costs of $14,527, together with disbursements of $1,207.26. stephen k j solicitors: crown law, wellington for appellant duncan cotterill, wellington for respondent 2 auckland gas co ltd v commissioner of inland revenue [1999] 2 nzlr 409 (ca). 3 at 416.

[2] when this matter was called ms thomas advised that, having given further consideration to the circumstances relating to the charge, she had a concern that the door of the prison cell should not have been capable of being broken in response to the kicks which the appellant had applied to it. in those circumstances she considered that, had the appellant been legally represented, greater attention would have been focused on the issue whether intention or recklessness could have been established in those circumstances. [3] consequently, and very responsibly, ms thomas indicated that the crown would not present opposition to the appeal. [4] in view of this development, mr parker’s appeal is allowed. his conviction on the charge of wilful damage is quashed and the fine, order for reparation and court costs, are all set aside. ________________________ brown j solicitors: preston russell law, invercargill

[2] on 29 september 2014 the appellant was sentenced to one and a half months imprisonment on the first and second charges and to six months imprisonment on the harassment charge, all sentences being cumulative. [3] he appeals against conviction on the charge of criminal harassment and against the total sentence of nine months imprisonment for all three charges. those appeals were to be heard today. [4] the ground of appeal in respect of his conviction on the charge of criminal harassment is that he received incompetent legal advice, that as a consequence he did not properly appreciate the nature of the charge or that he had a possible defence to the charge, and that a miscarriage of justice will occur if the conviction is not overturned. [5] affidavit evidence has been filed by the appellant and by two solicitors who represented him concerning the content of the legal advice which the appellant received. [6] in the light of that affidavit evidence counsel for the respondent filed a memorandum dated 2 march 2015 which states that given the multiplicity of alleged issues with representation, the gravity of the overall criminality, and the risk to the appearance of fair trial rights, it is appropriate that the appellant be able to advance his purported defence to the charge of criminal harassment. [7] in the crown’s submission the irregularity complained of has created a “real risk that the outcome of the [matter] was affected”1 and that the appropriate step is to quash the conviction and refer the matter back to the district court for a new trial. [8] in view of the crown’s submission i order that the conviction on the charge of criminal harassment is set aside pursuant to s 233(2) and a new trial be held pursuant to s 233(3)(b). [9] given that the sentence appeal relates to the total sentence for all three charges, that appeal is adjourned part heard pending the new trial on the charge of criminal harassment. ms cuthill agrees that that course is appropriate. 1 criminal procedure act 2011, s 232(4)(a). ___________________________ brown j solicitors: cruickshank pryde, invercargill preston russell law, invercargill

[3] the registrar was also correct formulating the test to be applied as follows: security for costs will only be dispensed with where i am of the view that it is right to require the respondent to defend the judgment under challenge without the usual protection as to costs provided by security. if a reasonable and solvent litigant would not proceed with the appeal having regard to the benefits of bringing the appeal weighed against the costs of bringing the appeal, then security for costs will not be dispensed with. [4] the registrar carefully reviewed all the relevant circumstances including the judgment under appeal before concluding that there were no exceptional circumstances justifying dispensation, and nor did the appeal carry any significant public interest. she correctly concluded that it would not be right to require the commissioner to defend the appeal without the usual protection for security for costs. [5] mr rafiq has not identified any error of principle or law by the registrar. moreover, she was correct to conclude also that the appeal was vexatious. it is also hopeless. andrews j was right to strike out mr rafiq’s proceeding as vexatious and an abuse of process of the court. [6] mr rafiq’s application to review the registrar’s decision is dismissed. accordingly he must pay the sum of $5,880.00 by way of security for costs on or before 23 february 2015. solicitors: meredithconnell,auckland for respondent

[2] counsel for the successful appellant has applied to recall the judgment under r 11.9. he seeks to havecosts in the district court addressed by this court. [3] the principles to apply to an application for recall are settled.2 in this case, the appellant submits there are very special reasons why justice requires the judgment be recalled. it is submitted that it is a case of the court overlooking the application for costs in the district court, which were sought in counsel’s submissions. [4] i decline the application for recall. the court dealt with the issue of costs on the appeal in this court and to the extent that any costs have been awarded in the district court (it seems costs were not settled in that court), set that costs order aside. it was always the intention of the court that costs in the district court would be dealt with in that court. i note counsel’s reference to s 76(1)(c) of the district courts act 1947, but in this case, the court applied that to the costs in this court. [5] for those reasons, the application to recall the judgment is dismissed. it should be clear to counsel that the issue of costs in the district court is to be dealt with in that court. venning j 1 idas group ltd v syntech nz ltd [2014] nzhc 3188. 2 horowhenua county v nash (no 2) 1986 nzlr 632.

[2] on 8 december 2014, the applicant filed a second application for leave to appeal against the same judgment of french j. the basis of the proposed appeal rests on the assumption that french j made an order requiring him to paysecurityfor 1 rabson v registrar of the supreme court [2014] nzsc 175. 2 rabson v registrar of the supreme court [2014] nzca481. malcolm edward rabson v registrar of the supreme court[2014] nzsc191[23 december 2014] costs and that her order (which directed that his appeal be accepted for filing) operated retrospectively. theapplicant also complains that the court ofappeal has not addressed his applications for a stay of the “order” and review of french j’s judgment under s 61a(2) of the judicatureact 1908. [3] leaving aside the fact that this is a second application, there is nothing of substance in it. (a) in her judgment, the judge said that she was extending time to pay security for costs to ensure that the applicant was not disadvantaged by the delay.3 she then said, “mr rabson must pay security for costs or apply to the registrar for dispensation of security within 20 working days …”.4 in the context, this was not an order that the applicant paysecurityfor costs but rather a description of the practical effect of the extension of time she granted. (b) there being no order, there was nothing to stay and there is, in this respect, nothing to challenge on appeal. (c) there is no jurisdiction under s 61a(2) to review the order of the judge.5 [4] the second application for leave to appeal is accordingly dismissed. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondents 3 at [9]. 4 at [9]. 5 see reekie v attorney-general [2014] nzsc 63, [2014]1 nzlr 737 at [24]–[26].

[3] both the high court and court of appeal held that the applicant’s resignations and his appointment of the other person as liquidator were not effective because notice of the appointment, as required by s 283(2) of the companies act, was not sent or delivered to the registrar of companies until 18 october 2012.6 the applicant disputes that conclusion. he says that when regard is had to the whole statutory scheme, including ss 241, 241a, 255, 280, 282 and 283 of the companies act, his resignation and the appointment of the other person was effective prior to his conviction in the afternoon of 16 october 2012. [4] this is a unique case with unusual facts. we are not persuaded that the proposed appeal raises any issue of public or general importance. as well, the applicant’s arguments, at least in the round, have been fully considered in the reasoned judgments of the high court and court of appeal and the interpretation adopted is in accordance with the language of s 283(2). more generally, there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice. solicitors: harmans lawyers, christchurchfor respondents 4 gemmell v norris [2012] nzhc 3339. 5 norris v gemmell [2014] nzca490. 6 norris v gemmell, above n5, at [27]; gemmell v norris, above n 4, at [21]–[22].

[3] the total claim to disbursements is now $20,136.33. this figure is less than the disbursements figureoriginally claimed by the defendant. [4] having considered the schedule and the invoices attached, the claim to disbursements is allowed except in one respect. in the schedule there are claims to disbursements in november 2011. these are disbursements relating to a settlement meeting in christchurch in october 2011. it appears that the defendant agreed to cover the expenses incurred by mr davis’s legal representatives in travelling to and from christchurchfor that meeting. i have been provided with no details of the basis upon which theseexpenses weremet bythedefendant orthe conditions attaching. it seems to me that if the defendant agreed to cover those expenses then they should not be claimed back from mr davis. accordingly, those items are disallowed. they amount in total to $1,393.40 and this figure is to be deducted from the total claim of $20,136.33 leavinga balance of $18,742.93.

[2] on 2 december 2014, ms kennedy, counsel for the defendant, filed a detailed application for costs in both the authority and this court in relation to the joinder application and she requested a timetabling order to enable submissions to be made in response and reply. ms kennedy advised that the investigation into the substantive matter in the authority is part heard and is rescheduled to continue on 27 march (presumably 2015). 1 sai systems ltd v bird [2014] nzempc 177. 2 bird v sai systems ltd [2014] nzera wellington 27. sai systems limited v graeme bird nzempc wellington [2014] nzempc 228 [12 december 2014] [3] ms buckett, counsel for the plaintiff, has submitted that the costs issues should be held-over pending final determination of the substantive matter before the authority. ms kennedy in response submitted that the issue of joinder was a discreet matter that had finally been determined by the court and, as such, the plaintiff was entitled to have costs fixed and paid at this stage. [4] although no authority was cited on the issue and this court has a discretion as to costs, the defendant’s application is consistent with rr 14.2(a) and 14.8(1) of the high court rules which collectively provide that unless there are special reasons to the contrary, a successful party to an interlocutory matter can expect to have costs fixed and thereupon they become payable by the losing party. [5] the timetabling order the plaintiff seeks would require all submissions to be filed prior to the christmas vacation but ms buckett has advised that she will be unavailable between 15 december 2014 and 20 january 2015. in the circumstances, i consider that the suggested timetable is too onerous on the defendant. i also consider that as the substantive matter is still before the authority, it is appropriate that any application for costs in relation to the authority’s determination on the interlocutory issue should be dealt with in that jurisdiction. [6] i, therefore, order that ms buckett is to file her submissions in response on or before friday, 23 january 2015 and ms kennedy is to file submissions in reply by 30 january 2015. i will then deal with the matter on the papers. a d ford judge judgment signed at 3.45 pm on 12 december 2014

[2] having succeeded in its application, accident compensation corporation (acc) now applies for scale 2b costs of $13,814.99 to be paid by mrs howard. [3] as the history of the matter, recorded at paragraph 13 of my judgment, shows, mrs howard – supported and represented by her husband mr howard, has pursued her complaint in an extended series of appeals and applications for special leave to appeal, including to each of this court, the court of appeal and the supreme court. howard v accident compensation corporation [2014] nzhc 3141 [10 december 2014] [4] i therefore have some sympathy with the corporation’s proposition that here costs should, in the normal event, follow the outcome of the application on a scale basis. the other relevant principle here is that, so far as possible, the determination of costs should be predictable and expeditious. those principles favour me ordering costs as sought by acc. [5] mrs howard opposes any award of costs. in her memorandum of 3 november 2014 she argues that the issues she raised were ones of public interest, she points to her limited personal means and repeats, by way of criticising my judgment (which of course she is perfectly entitled to do) the substance of her complaint. [6] mr and mrs howard have pursued a lengthy battle through the courts. they have had costs awarded against them on at least one occasion previously, in the court of appeal. at the same time, i accept their honesty and genuineness and that an award of the amount sought by acc is a significant sum of money for people in their position. [7] on that basis, and in terms of r 14.7(g) i have decided not to award costs as acc seeks. at the same time, however, i think some award of costs is appropriate, given the outcome. [8] i therefore order that mrs howard pays costs in the sum of $2,500 to acc. “clifford j” solicitors: mcbride davenport james, solicitors, wellington for respondent. copy to mr and mrs howard, ohura.

[2] i did so on the basis that, in dismissing the appellant’s appeal from the district court as abandoned, the high court must have been relying on s 338 of the criminal procedure act 2011. the crown accepts that the mandatory notice under s 338(2) was not given. this requires the court to give the appellant ten working days’ notice of its intention to dismiss the appeal under that section. while the criminal procedure act provides a formal process for an appellant to abandon an appeal under s 337, it does not provide for a judge to treat an appeal as abandoned. [3] in response to the minute of the court, the crown has now advised that it consents to the proposal contained therein. [4] accordingly, with the consent of the respondent: (a) leave to appeal is granted. (b) the appeal is allowed. (c) the matter is remitted to the high court for consideration of the appellant’s appeal to that court on the merits.

[2] the appellant appeals conviction but not sentence. the sentence is, he accepts, fair if he is guilty. [3] the appellant does not deny that he was driving his car on the night along the petone esplanade. he was apparently swerving along the road and admitted, when pulled over, that he had been drinking. he does not deny that a breath screening test was applied, nor does he dispute the result of the evidential breath test at 615 micrograms of alcohol per litre of breath. the appellant’s case is a procedural one. [4] the essence of the appellant’s case is that he is dyslexic and suffers from limited literacy. he said he did not understand “a lot of the information they provided me” about his rights on arrest. he said he did not receive any information in respect of his right to require an evidential blood test. he was, he said, not advised of these things orally. [5] the arresting constable gave evidence at trial that the appellant was verbally advised of his rights at the side of the road and that at each stage he was further advised verbally and in writing of his rights. the appellant said this was not true. [6] in a carefully reasoned and succinct judgment, the learned district court judge preferred the evidence of the arresting constable to that of the appellant. the constable was sober. the appellant was not. he had been observed weaving across the road and had admitted drinking. the appellant admitted in evidence he had been provided a summary of his rights verbally at the side of the road. the judge inferred from the fact that the appellant had signed the relevant form at each stage of the process that he had been given and read his rights. this is long-standing and standard procedure and the judge had no reason to doubt that the procedure had been followed in the appellant’s case. indeed the appellant admitted that when he had previously been arrested, he had in fact undertaken a blood test so was aware of this right.

[3] chrissie obtained resource consent for the subdivision of 10 acres. ross refused to transfer the land to her, maintaining she was only entitled to the camping ground land itself, an area of approximatelyfive acres. [4] the high court upheld chrissie’s claim to the 10 acres2and an appeal against that decision was dismissed in the court ofappeal, except that chrissie was held to be responsible for the costs of obtaining the subdivision’s resource consent.3 [5] the applicants apply for leave to appeal to this court. [6] this matter involves the interpretation of a one-off deed. as a result, no issues of general or commercial importance arise. the matter has been thoroughly examined by the high court and the court of appeal. nothing that has been put forward by the applicants suggests that the courts below erred in the approach to the interpretation of the deed in the context of the particular circumstances of this case.

[2] mr ellis represented himself before the district court and filed an appeal on his own behalf. the appeal was stated to be against sentence. [3] no submissions have been filed on behalf of mr ellis in support ofthe appeal and when the matter was called this afternoon there was no appearance by or on behalf ofmr ellis. [4] the notice ofthe date of the hearing of this appeal was sent to mr ellis at the address he recorded as his address on the notice of general appeal. [5] as there is no appearance in support of the appeal it could be dismissed for want of prosecution. however, in preparation for the appeal i reviewed the appeal file and i am satisfied that on its merits there is no substance to the appeal against sentence and indeed, for that matter, of any prospect of an appeal against conviction succeeding. [6] the judge in a carefully considered reserved decision correctly identified the elements of the offending, rehearsed and considered the evidence relating to those elements, and found each of the elements proved beyond reasonable doubt. in those circumstances a conviction was inevitable. [7] the sentence imposed, bearing in mind the maximum penalty available for offending of this nature, was towards the lower end of the scale and the period of disqualification is the minimum period prescribed by law. [8] in the circumstances the appeal is dismissed on its merits. venning j

[2] since the claim was issued, thompson park holdings ltd, has been put into liquidation. an order to that effect was made on 14 november 2014. section 284(1)(c) of the companies act 1993 prevents proceedings being continued against a company that has been put into liquidation without the consent of the liquidator or an order of the court. that means that the proceeding against thompson park holdings ltd is effectively stayed. [3] section 248(1)(d) also provides that no shares in the company can be transferred to another, unless the court otherwise orders.1 that may be the mode of rectification that is required should the point still be relevant once the available assets have been used for payment of any creditors. it is something that mr clode can liaise with the liquidator about. [4] the cause of action against mr jans seeks an order declaring that he has committed an offence against s 91 of the companies act 1993. i have explained to mr clode that this court exercising civil jurisdiction cannot make a declaration that a person has committed a criminal offence. that being the case, i have suggested that he make any complaint to the registrar of companies, so that it may be investigated if it has substance. [5] mr clode accepts that no useful purpose would be served by keeping this proceeding alive. in those circumstances, the claim is dismissed, with no order as to costs. p r heath j see the commentary on this provision in heath and whale on insolvency (lexisnexis, looseleaf) at paras 21.8 and 21.9.

[2] no grounds have been made out for anonymisation. mr bayley suggests that it is commonplace to anonymise the parties in proceedings involving maintenance and relationship property. he points out that the high court has done it in this very case. but s 11b of the family courts act 1980, which applies to relationship heazlewood v joie de vivre canterburyltd ca499/2014 [2014] nzca587[2 december 2014] property proceedings,1 provides that any person may publish a report of proceedings except in certain circumstances none of which is said to applyin this case. [3] nor are we prepared to have any details redacted from the judgment. no justification has been advanced for removing the reference to lane neave and the caveat number. the judgment should be released accordingly. [4] it is not necessary to direct that the court file not be searched without leave. rule 11(5) of the court of appeal (access to court documents) rules 2009, which corresponds to r 3.12(2) of the high court rules, provides that only with the court’s permission may a person access a document that relates to a proceeding brought under the property (relationships) act 1976, as this one was. that extends to the case on appeal, which contains the allegedly sensitive information. solicitors: godfreys law, christchurchforappellant rhodes & co, christchurch for respondent property(relationships)act 1976, s 35a.

[4] the effect of s 144 is that this court has no jurisdiction to consider mrmartin’s application. thecorrect course ofaction is formr martin to first seek leave from the high court to appeal to this court. if the high court declines leave, then he may apply to this court for special leave, but not otherwise. [5] mr martin was advised of the jurisdictional problem and given an opportunity to make submissions,3 but failed to do so. [6] this is an application for leave to appeal that should be dealt with on the papers and we so direct.4 [7] we dismiss the application for leave to appeal on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent 3 martin v r ca425/2014, 21november 2014 (minute offrench j). 4 crimesact 1961,s392a.

[2] the commissioner has filed a notice of appeal against my judgment. [3] on 3 november 2014, the commissioner filed an application seeking recall of my judgment, to amend the form of relief granted. in a memorandum in support of the application, mrs courtney noted that my attention had not been drawn to s 8(2) of the judicature amendment act 1972, and relevant consequential provisions in the crown proceedings act 1950. briefly summarised, mrs courtney submitted that the appropriate order to make against the commissioner was a declaration that the commissioner ought not to commence bankruptcy proceedings. she submitted that the court did not have jurisdiction to make an “interim order”. [4] i directed that the application be served on counsel for mr russell. on 24 november 2014, mr judd filed a memorandum opposing the application for recall. he submitted that it is by no means certain whether the appropriate form in which the commissioner is to be restrained from taking certain actions is by way of a declaration or an order. he referred to cases where an order had been made. [5] this issue was not argued before me at the hearing, i do not consider it appropriate to deal with it now. accordingly, i decline the application for recall. the judgment is to be sealed as delivered. [6] however, for the assistance of the parties, and any court considering the judgment subsequently, i record that, whether the relief was in the form of a declaration or an order, it would have been to the same effect. that is, the commissioner is restrained from commencing bankruptcy proceedings against mr russell, pending further order of the court. ________________________ andrews j

[2] the appellant has applied for a stay of the court of appeal’s judgment, pending the outcome of the appeal to this court. he also seeks a direction that the respondent provide him with copies of all documents filed by the respondent in both the high court and court ofappeal, and any judicial determinations made on them, since delivery of the court of appeal’s judgment. the respondent opposes both aspects of the application. [3] unless a stay is granted, the respondent will continue to take steps in anticipation of the formal proof hearing. the appellant’s contention is that there is a risk that, if he is successful in his appeal, steps taken by the respondent, and perhaps by the courts, which are based on the court of appeal’s judgment, will have to be undone at cost to the appellant and to the judicial system. court orders may also be made against him, in his absence, that may cause him prejudice. [4] this is not, however, a case in which the appeal will be made nugatory if a stay is refused. nor, in our view, will the appellant’s position be significantly prejudiced in those circumstances if this appeal succeeds. overall, the reasons given for taking steps to protect the appellant’s position, in case he is successful in the appeal, do not outweigh the respondent’s right to act in accordance with the judgment of the court ofappeal unless and until it is set aside. [5] nor do we see any reason in this case for us to intervene in the processes of the high court in relation to service of documents on the appellant. that is a matter for the high court.

in the high court of new zealand wanganui registry civ-2014-483-41 [2014] nzhc 2846 under the trustee act 1956 in the matter of the lance trust between dianne joan lance applicant and grahame hubert lance defendant hearing: on the papers counsel: g f kelly for the applicant judgment: 14 november 2014 judgment of mackenzie j i direct that the delivery time of this judgment is 4.30 pm on the 14th day of november 2014. solicitors: grey kelly law, wellington, applicant [1] in my judgment of 3 november 2014, i invited counsel for the applicant to submit a memorandum addressing the need for the application for the relief sought in paragraph (b) of the statement of claim, ordering that the powers of appointment, removal and replacement of trustees, presently contained in paragraph 10 of the trust deed, be vested in the trustees from time to time of the trust.1 i sought further elaboration from counsel about the need for such variation, having regard to the powers in s 43 of the trustee act 1956. [2] mr kelly for the applicant has filed a helpful memorandum. he explains that the application has been sought because it is considered that the powers in s 43 may not be adequate to address the long term administration of the trust. the long term disability of the settlor means that the powers in cl 10 are not likely to be available during his lifetime. the power in s 43 is more limited than the power in cl 10 of the trust deed. [3] with mr kelly’s explanation, i consider that it is appropriate to vary the power of appointment during the lifetime of the settlor, mr lance. however, as mr kelly’s memorandum rightly recognises, my reservations about granting the order related principally to the change which the proposed order would make to the power of appointment following mr lance’s death. that power, under cl 10, is vested in mr lance’s personal representative. mr kelly’s memorandum suggests that the practical implications of the change may not be significant. however, he suggests as an alternative that the court might limit the variation of the powers in cl 10 to the lifetime of the settlor only. [4] in the circumstances, i consider that is the better course. i make an order in terms of paragraph (b) of the prayer for relief, amended by adding, after the words “[o]rders that”, the words “during the lifetime of grahame hubert lance”. 1 lance v lance [2014] nzhc 2725. “a d mackenzie j”

[3] mr hokai appealed against the sentence imposed. it is agreed that the judge made a mathematical en-or in the computation of the sentences imposed. while, individually, there was no en-or, the correct end sentence ought to have been one of two years and one month's imprisonment. [4] as the appeal is designed only to correct the end sentence, the police do not oppose. i consider it is preferable that the end sentence be amended to avoid any risk that its current expression may disadvantage mr hokai inappropriately.

[2] although the defendant succeeded and the general principle is that the unsuccessful party pays costs, 2 i consider it is not appropriate to make any order in this case. i acknowledge that costs orders can be made against serving prisoners. however costs orders, like reparation orders, may impose unrealistic burdens on them which do nothing to assist their rehabilitation when they are released. consequently reparation orders are frequently not made if a person is to be sentenced to imprisonment. 1 forrest v chief executive of the department of corrections [2014] nzhc 1780. 2 high court rules, rr 14.2 and 14.8; forrest v the chief executive of the department of corrections [2014] nzhc 2703 [31 october 2014] [3] in this case mr forrest was bringing a claim under the new zealand bill of rights act 1990. it concerned the clothing prisoners are required to wear for prisoner visits. although the claim was struck out because it could not succeed, it cannot be said that it concerned a trifling matter. certainly there was nothing about mr forrest’s conduct that indicated he was anything other than genuinely concerned about the issue. he conducted his claim in a proper manner: his pleadings were carefully framed, he was responsibly cooperative in relation to the interlocutory steps, and his written and oral submissions were focussed on the issues.3 [4] in these circumstances, i consider that it is not appropriate to saddle him with the burden of a substantial costs order, which he will need to pay off over time when he is released, when his efforts should be focussed on rehabilitation and integration.4 the claim for costs is therefore declined. mallon j 3 high court rules, r 14.7(e). the same is true of his submissions on costs. 4 high court rules, r 14.7(g).

(b) if i am wrong in the conclusion expressed in (a), and the request was properlymade under r 6(1) of the rules, then i direct under r 6(3) that the information requested by the appellant not be made available to him or any lawyer he mayinstruct. i do that because theappellant has no legitimate interest in obtaining the information. it has no relevance to his ability to advance his appeal or defend the cross-appeal.

[2] the liability judgment was registered in the high court of new zealand under the reciprocal enforcement of judgments act 1934. the applicants applied to the high court to set aside the new south wales liability judgment. the high court refused that application and also gave mrs grabowski leave to register the costs judgment.1 the high court decision was upheld by the court of appeal.2 the applicants now wish to bring a further appeal to this court. [3] the present matter concerns the refusal of the acting registrar to waive fees on the filing of the application for leave to appeal. the applicants have sought a review by a judge of that decision under s 40 of the supreme court act 2003. [4] the only arguable ground under which the filing fee can be waived in this case is that under reg 5(3)(b)(iii) of the supreme court fees regulations 2003. the ground is that if the fee were not waived the applicant “would … suffer undue hardship if he or she paid the fee”. [5] the regulation requires not only that payment of the fee would cause financial hardship but that hardship would be “undue”, which means excessive. the applicants say their situation qualifies because their income is sporadic (coming from seasonal homestay board and their modest leech therapy business). they have credit card debt of $25,000. they say a statement by the acting registrar that they have income of $1,000 a week is wrong. [6] the applicants’ bank statements indicate that loan repayments are their biggest outgoings. there is no obvious pattern of substantial outgoings which are unexplained.

[2] the points raised by mr rafiq are not new, with one exception. the exception is that mr rafiq alleges that the court: 1 rafiq v chief executive of ministry of business, innovation and employment [2014] nzsc 72. … failed to consider that the review of the registrar’s decision not to dispense with security for costs was not presided by a panel of 3 judges including the president of the court of appeal. this has prejudiced the outcome of the court of appeal’s decision. [3] however, there is clear statutory authority for a single judge of the court of appeal to review a decision of the registrar as to security for costs: see s 61a(3) of the judicature act 1908 and rule 7(2) of the court of appeal (civil) rules 2005.

[3] on the four primary issues in the case, the applicant was unsuccessful in both the high court and court of appeal. in relation to the first two, this was substantially on the facts.3 in respect of the third, both courts applied the well-established rule that in general legal costs incurred in relation to disputes are not able to be recovered as damages. the fourth claim required an interpretation of the lease and settlement agreement. both courts resolved that issue against the applicant. [4] the case arises out of very particular contractual arrangements. there is no point of public or general commercial importance involved. as well, the applicant’s arguments have received thorough consideration in both the high court and court of appeal and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice. solicitors: chatwin legal limited, hamiltonfor respondent 1 boswell v millar [2013]nzhc 703, [2014] 3 nzlr 332. 2 boswell v millar [2014]nzca314, [2014] 3 nzlr332. 3 we accept that the factual issue in respect of the first issue fell to be determined in the context of anassessment of what was required under the co-operationagreement.

[3] it is common ground between the applicant and respondent that as a condition of granting bail the district comi judge required the respondent to provide a surety of $25,000 when the district comi has no jurisdiction to impose such a surety.1 the high court has inherent jurisdiction to impose a condition of bail that the respondent provide a surety.2 [4] i observe that the limitation ofjurisdiction was not pointed out to the district court judge.

[3] mr ma now applies for a further relaxation of his curfew. he wishes to be permitted to leave the bail address from 7.00 am until 8.00 pm daily. this will serve two purposes. the first is to better enable him to perform paternal functions. the second is to enable him to look for work. [4] the crown does not oppose the relaxation of the curfew. ms pollett has made inquiries with the officer in charge of the case who has confirmed that there have been no breaches of bail by mr ma. ms pollett tells me that the officer in charge “is relaxed” at the prospect of the bail variation. [5] for my part i take into account that mr ma is a new zealand citizen and i understand from the material before me why the opportunity to earn an extra income for the family is necessary. his history of complying with very restrictive bail conditions from december of last year, gives me some confidence that the risk of flight is attenuated. [6] accordingly, i grant the application for variation of bail. the curfew is now relaxed so that mr ma may be absent from the bail address between 7.00 am and 8.00 pm daily. this global condition replaces the previous relaxation which applied only to sundays. brewer j

[2] with the consent of the parties, we may have been prepared to address the question whether ss 13 and 16 of the interpretation act 1999 permit reconsideration of the kind proposed by mr rainey. it is a discrete legal issue, the determination of which is not affected by the facts of particular cases. that consent, however, has not been forthcoming. and in the absence of such consent it would not be appropriate, even if it were jurisdictionally possible, for this court to address, for the benefit of parties other than the appellants, decisions which were not in issue in the high court and court of appeal and in fact post-date our principal judgment. solicitors: rainey law, auckland for appellants heaney & partners, auckland for first respondent crown law office, wellington for second respondent and intervener

[3] the crown case against mr hoy and his co-offenders was based primarily upon evidence of text messages intercepted during a covert investigation into the methamphetamine dealing activities of a syndicate headed by mr hoy’s co-offenders. mr hoy was identified through his own intercepted communications (about 1,000) with other syndicate members. judge treston had the distinct advantage of having heard all the evidence at trial. the judge was satisfied that mrhoy was a significant participant in the syndicate’s commercial activities; and that he had actually been supplied about two grams of methamphetamine by the syndicate head during the relevant period. on this factual basis, and after taking account of the relevant sentencing principles, the judge fixed a startingpoint of three years. [4] mr lafferty properly conceded before us that mr hoy’s offending fell within the sentencing band of a starting point of two to four years imprisonment fixed in r v fatu for methamphetamine offending on this scale.2 he was unable to identify any error by the judge in adopting a starting point in the middle range of that band. we are independently satisfied that a starting point of three years imprisonment was open to the judge; and we are not satisfied, having regard to the sentences imposed on his co-offenders, that the judge erred in imposing an end sentence of three years imprisonment on mrhoy.

[2] the first is an application that i recuse myself from dealing further with this case. mr greer asserts that i am disqualified by having demonstrated bias against him, first in a bail appeal which i heard on an unrelated matter in 2010, which he asserts has led me to conduct his trial in a manner adverse to him. [3] as the trial judge, i should sentence mr greer unless there are good grounds to recuse myself. i am satisfied that none of the many matters raised by him justify recusal. the way i conducted the trial can potentially be raised on an appeal against conviction. i advised mr greer of that in a minute on 16 may 2014, and nothing in his further papers filed causes me to alter my view that no grounds for recusal are made out. [4] the application for recusal is accordingly dismissed. [5] mr greer has also made a renewed application for bail. bail is out of the question. that application is dismissed. [6] mr greer has also renewed an application for discharge. because the trial proceeded to jury verdicts, i have no power to discharge, or to declare a mistrial as mr greer requests. as i have said, any issues as to the conduct of the trial are a matter for appeal, not for this court. [7] mr greer has also made requests for documents from the court file. i addressed that request in my minute of 10 july 2014. i am not prepared to make any further order at this stage. [8] mr greer has also made application for an adjournment. this sentencing has already been delayed. there is no basis for any further delay. that application is refused.

[2] clause 3(b) of mrs johnstone’s will provides for the residue of her estate to go to her husband, john johnstone. however mr johnstone died on 10 march 2012.

[2] two memoranda have been filed, dated 25 and 28 august 2014. although counsel for the plaintiff had indicated at the hearing that indemnity costs would be sought against the second defendant, that is not now pursued. the plaintiff seeks costs on a 2b scale in the sum of $36,914.50, together with disbursements totalling $16,378.51. [3] while r 14.1 of the high court rules provides that all matters as to costs are at the discretion of the court, one of the general principles applicable to the determination of costs is that, pursuant to r 14.2(a), the party who fails in a proceeding should pay costs to the party who succeeds. i am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to an award of costs. [4] i have reviewed the plaintiff’s claim for costs. with two exceptions, i am satisfied that the claim is properlymadein accordancewith the scaleofcosts. those exceptions are in relation to preparation for hearing. at step 31, 2.5 days are allowed for “preparation of issues, authorities, and common bundle”. at step 33, 3 days is allowed for “preparation for hearing”. in the present case, where it was anticipated that there would be no appearance by or on behalf of the defendants, and the hearing itself occupied less than one-quarter of a day, i have concluded that the plaintiff should not be able to claim for the full amounts sought under those two headings. a proper allowance for step 31 is 1 day ($1,990) and 1.5 days ($2,985) for step 33. [5] by my calculation, that reduces the scale costs to $30,944.50. [6] iam satisfied that disbursements of $16,378.51 are properlyclaimed. andrews j kyle v huapai enterprises ltd [2014] nzhc 1981.

[2] i have pointed out to mr wichman-evans this morning after discussion with counsel for the commission of inland revenue and the official assignee that because that point has not yet been reached (and probably will never be able to be) there is no basis for ending the liquidation. the procedures that directors/shareholders of the company would have to negotiate to get to the point where a reconsideration of the liquidation could be undertaken by the official assignee are complex and will cost money. the inland revenue is not prepared to re-visit the assessments that underlie the cir’s debt without financial contribution from a third party (whether mr wichman-evans or someone else). so long as the official assignee who is the correct party to take such matters up with the ird is concerned is not prepared to do so there is little hope, i’m afraid, that the point will ever be reached where the assessments are overturned. that being so it seems almost certain that the existing debt of approximately $200,000 will remain unpaid and that being so there will be no possible basis for a termination of the liquidation of the company. therefore the application which duane leslie wichman-evans filed 5 august 2014 is struck-out. [3] the commission of inland revenue has sought costs on the application. i consider that given the position of the applicant is that he brought proceedings in good faith, albeit mistakenly, that this is a case where exceptionally the discretion of the court to award costs in favour of the successful party should not be followed. there will be no order for costs. j.p. doogue associate judge

[2] the first respondent seeks indemnity costs contending: (a) the appeal had no merit; (b) the notice of appeal did not particularise the points on appeal so that these had to be distilled from the written submissions, increasing the preparation time required; and (c) the appellant took a “scattergun” approach to the appeal rather than focusing on alleged errors in the judgment. [3] alternatively, if the court is not prepared to award indemnity costs, the first respondent seeks costs calculated on a 2b basis. [4] the appellant disputes the first respondent’s contentions regarding the wayhe conducted the appeal. he submits that indemnity costs are not appropriate in this case. however, the appellant does not oppose an award of 2b costs and he agrees with the first respondent’s calculation of these. [5] in my, there is nothing about this case that would warrant a departure from scale costs. although i accept that the points raised by the appellant in support of his appeal were wide-ranging and somewhat unfocused, i do not consider that the way he conducted his appeal would justify an award of indemnity costs. such awards are reserved for exceptional cases. [6] accordingly, the first respondent is entitled to costs on the appeal calculated on a 2b basis in accordance with mr brittain’s memorandum. m a gilbert j

[3] the document the subject of this application is a draft will prepared sometime in 2014 by the same hastings solicitors who prepared the valid will. have identified above the executors under that document. the document provides for bequests -$20,000 to a friend, karen shailer, and a mini motor vehicle to the co­executor peter johns. the remainder is to be vested in a trust to be distributed on 30 june 2016-with one-third to each of his three daughters: lorna caroline stanley, estate of michael de charmes beauchamp [2014] nzhc 2006 [22 august 2014] joanne cherie beauchamp, and ellen beth beauchamp. the allocation to ellen beth beauchamp is to be held on further trust until she reaches 30 years. the trustees of that second trust are however empowered to release funds to the beneficiary before that date in order for her to purchase a home or for other special purposes, provided her mother (the co-executor) wendy beauchamp consents. [4] all parties i have mentioned here consent to the validation of this document as the deceased's will. the document is not a valid will in terms of s 11 of the act, because it has not been executed or attested. it clearly purports to be a will and was intended to be such. the deceased simply did not get around to signing it. i have no doubt that it represents the deceased's testamentary intentions and so the requirements of s 14 are satisfied. [5] in light of the consent of all affected parties, it is in order for me to validate the document as the will of the deceased. i jt/~-i ---------------, wi~sj
in the court ofappealofnew zealand [2014] nzca 406 between miles roger wislang intended appellant and thenorth shore family court intended respondent judgment: 20 august 2014 at 12.00 pm judgment ofwhite j (review of deputy registrar’s decision) the application for review of the deputy registrar’s decision declining to accept a notice of appeal filedby the intended appellant is dismissed. reasons [1] this is an application for review of a decision of a deputy registrar of this court to refuse to accept for filing a purported notice of appeal. [2] the application is made under r 7(2) of the court of appeal (civil) rules 2005. i intend to address the substance of the application, but do not express a view on the scope of r 7(2) or its applicability to decisions of this nature. [3] mr wislang has sought to file in this court an appeal against “the decision of cooper j, given in the high court at auckland on 16th july 2014, to refuse to timeously hear an urgent interlocutory application, dated 4th july 2014, for interim orders in proceedings of judicial review, reference civ-2014-404-1670”. [4] the deputy registrar of this court did not accept the purported notice of appeal because he considered that the decision to which it related was not an appealable decision. [5] the background to the decision to which the purported notice of appeal relates is that mr wislang has filed an application for judicial review in the high court at auckland in relation to an interim restraining order made by the north shore family court. [6] by minute dated 16 july 2014 cooper j in the high court at auckland directed that the circumstances were not such as to warrant the matter being called prior to the respondents, the north shore family court and the minister of social development, taking any steps in response.1 cooper j vacated the mention of the case scheduled for thursday 16 july 2014. [7] mr wislang has advised that the judicial review proceeding is now to be called in the high court at auckland on 21august 2014. [8] cooper j’s minute of 16 july 2014 does not contain a judgment, decree or order to which s66 ofthe judicatureact 1908 relates. thedecision recorded in the minute does not prevent the judicial review proceeding from being heard. it dealt with a preliminary matter of case management which could not be the subject of an appeal to this court. [9] thedecision ofthe deputyregistrar ofthis courtnot toaccept mrwislang’s purported notice of appeal for filing was therefore correct. [10] the application for reviewof the registrar’s decision is dismissed. solicitors: crownlawoffice,wellington for respondent wislang v the family court at north shore hcauckland civ-2014-404-1670,16july2014.

[1] the above question is intended to cover the commission’s arguments as to whether the high court should have made declarations, given the alleged deficiencies in the factual foundation before the court, as well as the issue of the correct interpretation of s 48 of the fire service act 1975. newzealand fire service commissionvinsurance brokersassociation of new zealand incorporated [2014] nzsc 113[18august 2014] [2] the respondents have asked that this appeal be heard this year before mrsimpson retires. they consider that morethan onehearingdaywillbe needed. the registrar should therefore endeavour (if possible) to set the appeal down for a dayand a half before the end of the year. solicitors: dlaphillips fox,wellington forapplicant bell gully,auckland for the first and second respondents

[2] the parties agreed at a case management hearing that the appropriate category was 2b. the respondent seeks increased costs because the respondent had herself incurred increased costs because she had appointed new counsel who was then unable to complete the hearing (he was appointed a judge) and current counsel had to appear and get fully up to date on a complex and detailed history that the case involved. cms trustees ltd v c e v r [2014] nzhc 1905 [13 august 2014] [3] secondly, solicitor/client costs are in the region of $15,000, considerably more than costs on a 2b basis. [4] in my view neither ground is a basis for increased costs. while i appreciate the difficulties current counsel had in coming up to speed with this case at the last moment that is not a basis for increased costs against cms trustees limited. [5] secondly, 2b cost appears to work out at $10,029.60. i do not know what the actual costs are – it is said to “exceed $15,000”, but it is not known by how much. costs of $10,000 would be two thirds of the $15,000 mentioned in the respondent’s submissions which is the desired reimbursement level. [6] i therefore refuse the application for increased costs. i set costs on a 2b basis as per the respondent’s memorandum at $10,029.60, including disbursements. [7] cms trustees limited is now in liquidation. counsel for the respondent included an application in its costs memorandum for a costs order to be made against the directors of cms trustees limited. without accepting responsibility the directors of cms trustees limited have agreed to pay the 2b costs awarded. in those circumstances i do not need to consider the respondent’s application. ronald young j solicitors: d g dewar, wellington m l greenhough, wellington
in the high court of new zealand rotorua registry civ-2012-463-000275 [2014] nzhc 1872 in the matter of the estate of unity ann eterna (also known as unity ann ellmers) of turangi, retired, radiographer, deceased in the matter of rule 27.6 et seq of the high court rules between ian donald farquhar plaintiff and malcolm ross ellmers defendant hearing: on the papers counsel: j n briscoe for plaintiff g r webb for defendant judgment: 8 august 2014 judgment of williams j (consent orders and decision as to costs) [1] this matter has been referred to me by associate judge christiansen. it is unnecessary for me to refer to the lengthy background. the parties are agreed that the application for probate in solemn form in relation to the deceased’s will dated 16 april 2008 be declined and that probate be granted instead in relation to the will of 1 july 2002. i make those orders accordingly by consent. [2] the only remaining issue is as to costs. the defendant asks that his costs be met by the plaintiff/executor personally and that the plaintiff/executor be required to carry his own costs as well. [3] the arguments are essentially that costs should follow the event and the defendant was successful, and secondly that this is one of the rare cases where the executor should not be entitled to have his costs met by the estate. this, says the defendant, is because of the unreasonable and obdurate stance the executor took in relation to these proceedings. [4] according to the laws of new zealand, administration of estates, an executor who approves a will normally in solemn form will be entitled to costs from the estate.1 but executors may be refused costs or required to pay costs to a successful party if it is proved that he or she must have known that the will could not be supported. unreasonable and obdurate conduct by the executor may disentitle access to estate funds and render the executor liable for costs for him or herself. [5] the question in this case is whether the executor here crossed that line. i do not think he did. on the contrary the executor appeared to adopt a position more closely akin to that of the defendant once a medical opinion was to hand, tending to suggest that the deceased lacked testamentary capacity. although the executor could have been more careful and thoughtful in seeking to propound the deceased’s 2008 will, in light of her known psychiatric difficulties, i accept that his stance could not be described as unreasonable. [6] the defendant will be entitled to costs of a category 2b basis. the costs of the plaintiff may be met by the estate. 1 laws of new zealand administration of estates at [122]-[127]. ___________________________ williams j solicitors: davys burton, rotorua for plaintiff nolans, gisborne for defendant

[2] mr rabson submits the decision should be recalled on threebasis: (a) that glazebrook j should not have participated in the review decision; rabson v chapman [2014] nzsc 90. malcolm edward rabson vwayne seymour chapman [2014] nzsc 103 [6august 2014] (b) if that is not accepted, that the review decision should have been made by five judges; and (c) that the decision was in contravention of mr rabson’s “statutory right of appeal”. [3] the first two points were dealt with explicitly in our review decision. as explained at n 3 of that decision, the court assumed that s 28(3) of the supreme court act 2003 applies to leave applications. ifthat is the case, the court comprises the judges set down to hear that application. section 28(3) requires the participation of the judge whose decision is the subject of the review. [4] mr rabson’s third ground is a repeat of his argument on his review application. we point out that there is no statutory right of appeal. there is only a right to apply for leave to appeal. mr rabson’s application for leave to appeal is adjourned only and so remains live until granted or dismissed. [5] the application for recall is therefore dismissed. the way forward [6] it appears from his submissions that mr rabson does not wish to apply for recall of the court of appeal’s decision. if mr rabson does intend to make an application for recall, then he should inform the registrar of this court on or before 5pm, 14 august 2014. if no communication to the registrar is made by that date, this court will make a decision on his leave application. solicitors: buddle findlay,wellington for the respondent

[3] in the present application for recall of the judgment, mr rafiq raises no grounds which would justify recall of the judgment. he asserts, without further reasons, that the decision of the court was in error and says that the “allegations that are subject matter of this proceeding are presently being shared with other departments and agencies and this action needs to end”. no substantiation for the assertion that the court ofappeal erred is provided by way of elaboration.

[3] the banks seek leave to appeal to this court against these directions, in particular the directions in (b) and (d). there is a question as to whether they filed their application in time, but as any delay was minimal, we will address the application on its merits. [4] procedural orders of the sort made by stevens j are made under s 61a(1) of the judicatureact 1908. under s 61a(2)such directions maybe varied orset aside byapanel ofcourt ofappeal judges. that is themechanismbywhich challenges to this type of procedural order should be brought pre-hearing. [5] if the directions of the single judge are upheld on review, the unsuccessful party may seek leave to appeal to this court, although the court is most unlikely to grant leave in respect of an interlocutory application of that type. the appropriate course is for the unsuccessful party to wait until the substantive appeal has been determined and, if unsuccessful, to seek leave to appeal to this court against that substantive decision, raising the alleged procedural error(s) as a ground of appeal, along with any other grounds. [6] this is not to say, of course, that this court would necessarily grant leave in such circumstances. the application for leave to appeal would have to meet the grounds set out in s 13 of the supreme court act 2003. [7] in the result, we are not satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice that we hear and determine this appeal. accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed. solicitors: simpson grierson,wellington for respondent

[2] this is the first time that mr liu has advanced an application based on electronically monitored bail. [3] the earlier decisions of this court (see liu v r [2014] nzhc 1422 and liu vr hc auckland cri-2014-044-1376, 9 may 2014) reveal a concern that mrliu poses a flight risk. electronically monitored bail may obviate that risk. [4] as matters stand, i would not have been prepared to grant mr liu bail, for the same reasons as the other judges had refused bail. but i do consider that the prospect of electronically monitored bail should be fully explored. if that can remove the flight risk, then it seems to me that in terms of the other factors in the bailact 2000 and the presumption of innocence, mr liu should be granted bail. [5] i understand from mr liu’s counsel that he will now be making an application for electronically monitored bail. rather than dismiss the present application, i will adjourn it to a date to be fixed by the registry, once the report on the suitability of mr liu for electronically monitored bail has become available. [6] i understand from his counsel that mr liu’s employer is likely to re-employ him, should bail conditions permit him to attend work while on em bail. [7] consequently, i direct that the em bail assessors are to explore the suitability of mr liu’s proposed residence for a term of em bail, and mr liu’s suitability for being employed whilst on em bail. it is for mr liu to provide the assessors with the necessary information regarding his residence and prospective employer. duffy j

[2] mr clarke filed a notice of appeal. essentially, the notice of appeal says that the condition of bail relating to the emergency services is difficult to obey because of its uncertain reach. [3] i agree the condition of bail imposed is uncertain as to its meaning. presumably the emergency services are the fire service, the ambulance and the police. the bail condition would prevent mr clarke from calling these services other than in emergencies. obviously citizens will have occasions when they need to call the emergency services but there is no emergency. the judge could not have intended to prevent mr clarke from contacting the emergency services where he had a genuine enquiry but which was not an emergency. [4] the bail condition is, therefore, quashed. no alternative phrasing was suggested by the police which was functional. given a malicious phone call can be an offence (telecommunications act 2001, s 112(2)(a)) no substitute bail condition is required. ____________________________ ronald young j solicitors: luke cunningham & clere, crown solicitors, wellington

[3] although mr mitchell filed detailed submissions in support of his appeal, he was represented by ms green at the appeal hearing. ms green conceded that there is a fundamental jurisdictional bar to mr mitchell’s appeal. this arises from s 69e(1)(e) of the sentencing act 2002 which provides: 69e conditions of community detention during sentence term (1) an offender sentenced to community detention is subject to the following conditions during the sentence term: … (e) the offender must, when required to do so by a probation officer, submit to the electronic monitoring of compliance with the conditions of his or her sentence, which may require the offender to be connected to electronic monitoring equipment throughout the sentence term and not just throughout the curfew period; [4] thus, it is not the district court that imposes the condition as to electronic monitoring; the probation officer may require an offender to submit to electronic monitoring. [5] this court has no jurisdiction to revisit the probation officer’s requirement that mr mitchell submit to electronic monitoring. it has no appellate jurisdiction in respect of the probation officer’s decision. [6] accordingly, mr mitchell’s appeal against sentence is dismissed. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent

[2] mr holmes deposed that he is unable to meet the judgment sum personally. however, he also asserted that his appeal is genuine and if a stay was not granted he could be bankrupted, rendering his appeal rights nugatory. mr holmes had proposed either an undertaking or a guarantee by holmes ventures ltd (hvl) to meet the judgment in the event of the appeal failing. he said that hvl has net assets worth more than $10 million. however, hvl willnot give kiriwai access to its accounts forcommercial reasons. [3] kiriwai will not accept either an undertaking or guarantee from hvl. it is not satisfied that hvl is sufficiently secure and does not wish to rely on hvl to meet the judgment. there was evidence at trial that the second defendants, mr holmes and mr russell, as trustees of mr holmes’ family trust, received the substantial purchase price for the hvl shareholding that gave rise to this litigation. kiriwai considers that the trustees should be offering security. mr holmes has not given any explanation as to why they have done so. [4] hvl’s unwillingness to allow kiriwai access to its accounts is understandable. so, too, too, is kiriwai’s unwillingness to accept mr holmes’ assurances regarding hvl. there is a long and unsatisfactory history between these parties. however, in the usual course kiriwai would be entitled to enforce its judgment and i saw no reason why the usual course should not be followed. [5] following my decision to refuse the application mr dale undertook that no steps would be taken to enforce the judgment for 14 days, during which time mr gray would see if satisfactory security could be provided by the trustees. the matter was left on that basis, with leave reserved to come back to me ifnecessary. p courtneyj

[2] we see none of the arguments advanced as warranting recall of the judgment. [3] the allegations of torture were not ignored as the conduct said to amount to torture was referred to, as were the associated findings of fact made in the high court. the court noted the apparent inconsistency between the practice which obtained before the court of appeal (civil) rules 2005 and the approach taken in siemer v heron.2 there was no inconsistency between the conclusion that the wrongful detention claim was arguable and the conclusion that mr reekie had suffered no detriment because if all issues had been appropriately addressed, he would have remained in custody for the relevant period. [4] the more general challenges (to the difficulties identified by the court as to the role of the registrar, the general principles set out in the judgment and the engagement by the court with the merits of the appeals to the court of appeal) raise nothing new. solicitors: crown law office, wellington for respondents 1 reekie v attorney-general [2014] nzsc 63. 2 siemer v heron [2012] nzsc 91.

[2] mr king then issued proceedings against asb seeking to have the loan agreements reopened or to obtain other relief, on the basis that asb breached the credit contracts and consumer finance act 2003 and the fair trading act 1986. as the proceeds of the sale were insufficient to meet mr king’s full indebtedness, asb issued a counterclaim seeking to recover the balance. asb sought summary bruce james king v asb bank limited [2014] nzsc 97 [28 july 2014] judgment both on its counterclaim and as a defendant in respect of mr king’s claims against it. katz j granted both applications.1 [3] mr king then filed an appeal in the court of appeal. he applied for a waiver of the requirement to pay security for costs. when the registrar dismissed his application, mr king sought a review of her decision by a single judge of the court of appeal. ellen france j dismissed his application and ordered him to pay security in the amount of $5,880 by 28 april 2014.2 mr king now seeks leave to appeal against that decision. [4] in addition, mr king has filed an application for a stay of the determination of his leave application. he did so because a friend has agreed to lend him sufficient funds to cover the security fixed by the court of appeal and he wishes to see whether the court of appeal will permit him to revive his appeal by paying security for costs after the date fixed by ellen france j. [5] whatever the outcome of mr king’s further application to the court of appeal, we see no reason to delay dealing with his application for leave to appeal to this court against ellen france j’s decision. accordingly, we dismiss his application for a stay of our determination. [6] we are not satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice that we hear and determine this appeal. as the principles concerning security for costs were recently addressed by this court in reekie v attorney-general,3 the proposed appeal does not raise any issue of general or public importance. moreover, there is nothing in the material before us to indicate that there is any risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. [7] accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed. the applicant must pay the respondent costs of $2,500. solicitors: simpson grierson, auckland for respondent 1 king v asb bank ltd [2013] nzhc 2914. 2 king v asb bank ltd [2014] nzca 102. 3 reekie v attorney-general [2014] nzsc 63.

[2] the decision of the court of appeal dismissing g’s appeal is dated 12 june 2013. g’s application is dated 30 may 2014 and is, accordingly, well out of time. 1 rv g dcwellington cri-2011-035-1816,27 september 2012. 2 g(ca663/2012) v r [2013]nzca222. g(sc55/2014) v r [2014] nzsc95 [22 july2014] however, because g is self-represented, we will consider the application on its merits. [3] while it is not entirely clear from the material filed, g’s principal ground appears to be that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable as there was insufficient evidence to support it. he also expresses concern about the way both his trial counsel and his counsel on his appeal conducted his case. [4] thecourt ofappeal accepted thattherewere some issues withaspects ofthe complainant’s evidence, but considered nevertheless that she was consistent in relation to the essential allegation against g. the court concluded that there was a rational and legitimate basis for the jury’s guilty verdict. as this court has stated previously, it is not the role of a final appellate court to embark on a review of the strength of evidence at trial in a case where, as here, the court of appeal has delivered a fully reasoned judgment addressing the concerns that are the basis of the application to this court.3 [5] moreover, the concerns raised about counsel do not suggest that g suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of not having a fair trial or because the guilty verdict may be unsafe.4 g’s concerns about trial counsel were not raised in his appeal to the court of appeal and his concerns about appellate counsel are no more than general. [6] we are not satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice that we hear and determine this appeal. it does not raise any issue of general or public importance and nothing has been raised to indicate that a substantial miscarriage of justice may have occurred. accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent 3 see, for example, burgess v r [2008] nzsc 79 at [4]. 4 see r v sungsuwan [2005] nzsc 57, [2006]1 nzlr 730.

[3] thecrown case was primarilybased on visual recognition ofthe applicant as the person who answered the door when a police officer knocked, and who sold the officer a tinnie. the officer gave detailed evidence of the appearance of the seller blair v r [2014] nzca101. paulanthonyblair v r [2014] nzsc 92[21 july2014] and identified the applicant from a photo montage. the officer also gave evidence that the seller he spoke with had a distinctive baritone voice and was the same person who had earlier called out “hold on” before answering the door. the applicant admitted being on the premises at the time and that he was the person who called out when the police officer knocked. his defence was that there was another person in the house, of similar appearance to the applicant, who answered the door, spoke with the officer and made the sale. [4] the voice identification evidence had been admitted without objection at trial. the court of appeal decided that, on the balance of probabilities, it was reliable and therefore admissible under s 46 of the evidence act. the voice was distinctive, there was no background distorting noise and there had been a very short period of time between the two voices that were heard.2 we see no arguable error of approach nor any flaw in this reasoning that is indicative of a miscarriage of justice. we see it as relevant to our conclusion that this is a case where two voices were heard ‘side byside’in circumstances where the opinion of the officer was based on a comparison that, on the evidence, he was in a position to make. it is not a case of an identification based on the familiarity of the witness with the accused’s voice. [5] in relation to whetherawarning should have been givento the jury,a detailed direction on the visual identification evidence was given by the judge, concerning which therewasno complaint. thecourt ofappeal decided that the crown casedid not depend “wholly or substantially on the voice identification” in terms of s 126 of the evidence act. it turned on the visual identification.3 we see this analysis as correct beyond argument, so that no direction was required under s 126. [6] overall, the applicant raises no matter of general or public importance. nor is there any indication a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred. [7] leave to appeal against conviction is refused. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor respondent 2 at [11] and [13]. 3 at [21] and [26].

[2] the matter was then allocated a directions conference because the judge directed that and also directed a hearing. however, the current position is that ms small is not advancing a request to relocate the children. she feels aggrieved that mr eccleston has obtained this order. she would like to have a conversation with him, but i have an impression that he is not really available for that conversation. [3] ms meates asked me to refer the matter to family disputes resolution so that they can have that conversation. i do not perceive there is a legal issue that would support my making such a reference, nor that it would be proper for me to do so. that is because, although mr eccleston has obtained an order, ms small is not seeking to relocate the children out of auckland at the present time, and, accordingly, there is no issue between the parties currently within the parameters of mr eccleston’s application. [4] it strikes me that unless a party makes an application for orders generally regarding the day-to-day care of the children, or ms small makes an application to relocate or to set aside the order that has been obtained, the matter is effectively closed. [5] even if ms small applied to set aside the order i would not regard it as appropriate to refer it to fdr. it would be a more appropriate course to simply set that down for hearing.

[4] mr rabson applies for a review of glazebrook j’s adjournment decision under s 28(3) of the supreme court act.3 [5] the course suggested to mr rabson in glazebrook j’s minute was the sensible course and likelyto be the most expeditious. [6] the application for review is declined. solicitors: buddle findlay,wellington for the respondent we are assuming that s 28(3) applies to an application for leave to appeal. the court conducting the review is the court which was set down to decide the leave application. as we note in siemer v stiassny [2014] nzsc 80 at [4] and [6], section 28(3) requires the participation of glazebrook j inthe court deciding the review.

[1] i refer to my judgment of 2 july 2014.1 when i issued that judgment i understood that there were two requests from television new zealand in relation to the psychologist’s report. the tvnz request had sought only the report of a psychologist ms tolond. i refused the tvnz application. i now appreciate that in fact there were two different requests, one from tvnz news and one from the new zealand herald. the crown opposed both applications. [2] i now deal specifically with the new zealand herald request. the new zealand herald request seeks copies of all documents on the present court file without limitation. [3] for the same reasons that i have set out in my earlier judgment, applying my discretion under r 6 of the criminal procedure rules 2012, i refuse access at this point in the proceeding. in addition to ms tolond’s report, there is a good deal of confidential material on the file. it is personal to mr robertson and if he is not convicted he would wish to keep it confidential. [4] the reason put forward for accessing the court file is “… to access the information as soon as possible to prepare reports for publication at the conclusion of the new proceedings faced by mr robertson.” this reason is not persuasive. there is no need for any particular media organisation to have access in advance of and in anticipation of suppression being lifted. the file is of moderate dimensions, and could be read and understood by an experienced journalist within a relatively short timeframe. all journalists are likely to have an equal opportunity to apply to see the material if suppression is lifted. they can review their position then. [5] for the time being, a balancing of the r 6.10(2) factors leads to a conclusion in favour of privacy.

[2] i deal first with the question of which party should pay costs. [3] i consider that in the light of r 14.2(a) hcr costs should be paid by the applicant as the party who has failed to the respondent who is the party who has succeeded. [4] the costs and disbursements which are set out in the memorandum which mr bogiatto has filed appear to be reasonable. i therefore make an order that costs on a 2b basis are to be paid by the applicant in the sum of $5,970 together with disbursements of $110.00. j.p. doogue associate judge

[2] mr higgins is a young, first offender. there was evidence that his offending may have been contributed to when he failed to continue taking prescription medication for a diagnosed condition of adhd. no permanent damage was caused by the tagging, and no reparation was sought. [3] in a very brief decision recording the outcome only, the judge convicted mr higgins following his guilty plea and fined him $750 together with court costs of $130 in the following terms: [1] mr higgins, on the one charge to which you earlier entered a guilty plea, convicted and fined $750, court costs of $130. [4] mr higgins had originally appealed his conviction, but that appeal has been abandoned. the question before me today is simply whether the fine of $750 is, as mr crowley has submitted, out of line with general sentencing practice in the district court and hence manifestly excessive. his submission was that such practice would typically involve fines for this type of offending of between $100 and $200. [5] for the crown ms whittaker was not able to throw any light on sentencing practice in the district court. ms whittaker acknowledged she had no basis on which to challenge that submission. [6] on that basis, i consider i should accept mr crowley’s submission. i certainly have no reason not to do so. nor, and this is no criticism of the judge’s decision in what was a very straightforward matter, am i assisted as to any written reasons why the particular level of fine was imposed. a sentence will be manifestly excessive where it is significantly out of line with accepted sentences for like offending. on the basis of the materials before me, i am satisfied that that is the case with the $750 fine imposed on mr higgins. [7] i therefore allow the appeal and substitute a fine of $150 in place of the court ordered fine in the district court of $750. the order for court costs will remain. “clifford j” solicitors: b cowley, barrister, wellington for the appellant. crown solicitor, wellington for the respondent.

[4] at the hearing before woodhouse j the stepdaughters opposed leave being granted to commence proceedings by originating application. that was effectively resolved againstthem bythe grant ofleavethe judgemade. counsel fortheplaintiff was ready to argue the matter substantively before woodhouse j. it was adjourned by the judge as a matter of fairness because the stepdaughters were not in a position to argue the matter that day. the costs associated with that hearing should be allowed as against the stepdaughters. [5] further, following that grant of leave the substantive relief sought by the plaintiff was effectively conceded with the appointment of the public trust as trustee. [6] in the circumstances there will be costs to the plaintiff on a 2b basis calculated in accordance with the scheduled attached to mr fuscic’s memorandum, save for a reduction for the hearing time to a quarter day, namely $1,892 to be paid out ofthe estategenerally; $6,291.70 to bepaidout ofthe stepdaughters’sharefrom the estate. venning j

[2] the first issue for me is to consider whether the application can properly be dealt with without notice, under r 7.46(2) of the high court rules. i am satisfied that there are no other persons who are affected by the application or the order sought who should be given an opportunity to be heard on the present application. i accordingly am satisfied, under r 7.46(3), that the interests of justice require the application to be determined without notice. [3] the circumstances giving rise to the error in the drafting of the will appear from the affidavit of the solicitor who prepared the will, mr deacon. mr deacon’s firm prepared mirror wills for the deceased and his late wife. the will of the wife was prepared first and was used as a template for preparing the will of the husband. that method of drafting meant that the word “him” had to be changed to “her” and the word “husband” had to be changed to “wife”. the necessary changes were overlooked, in two places. [4] i am satisfied, in terms of s 31(1) of the wills act 2007, that the corrections sought are necessary to correct a clerical error in the will, to carry out the deceased’s testamentary intentions. [5] there will be an order correcting the will of the deceased dated 6 november 2008, a copy of which is annexed to the affidavit of mark barry deacon sworn on 13 may 2014 as follows: (a) changing the word “him” where it appears in cl 2 of the will to “her”; (b) changing the word “husband” where it appears in cl 3 to “wife”. “a d mackenzie j”

[3] mr siemer’s recall application is on the basis that glazebrook and arnold jj should not have been on the court for the s 28(3) review. this is because glazebrook j conducted the review under s 28(2) and arnold j had been involved siemer v stiassny [2014] nzsc70. vincentross siemer vmichaelpeter stiassny&anor [2014] nzsc80[25 june 2014] with the matter at an earlier stage. mr siemer also says that he should have been given the opportunity to make submissions on the composition of the court. [4] thereason glazebrook and arnold jj wereon the court was explained in the judgment,2 byreference to this court’s decision in howard v accident compensation corporation.3 that case involved an application for review of a decision by mcgrath junder s28(2)ofthe supreme court act. mcgrathj was part ofthe court deciding the s28(3) review. in that case the court said:4 adecision under s 28(3) is to be made by the “judges of the supreme court who together have jurisdiction to hear and determine a proceeding”. the subsection has obvious application to decisions made by a single judge under s 28(1) or (2) being reviewed at the subsequent hearing of the substantive appeal. in such circumstances, the judge who made the decision would probably be involved in the exercise (which is why mcgrath j has participated in this decision). we are addressing the applicant’s application on the assumption, but without deciding, that s 28(3) is available in the present, and rather different, circumstances. [5] mr siemer was apparently unaware of this court’s decision in howard v accident compensation corporation and so did not make submissions on the composition of the court in his s 28(3) application. he has, however, now had the opportunity to make submissions on this point in this recall application. [6] the court has considered mr siemer’s submissions but is not persuaded that its interpretation of s 28(3), as set out in howard v accident compensation corporation, is wrong. the participation of glazebrook and arnold jj on the court was required by s 28(3),5 despite their earlier involvement in the matter.

[3] nothing in what the applicant has put to us raises matters that could give the court jurisdiction to reconsider the judgment it has delivered. the court is also satisfied that the form of its judgment, which addressed applications in respect of three judgments of the court of appeal and high court, was appropriate in the circumstances.

[2] the applicant’s first ground for seeking reconsideration is that the court did not address in its judgment the validityof the warrant for imprisonment under which he is detained. this is incorrect. in paragraph [8], the court found that the warrant had been properly issued, in respect of an amended sentence imposed by the court of appeal, thus upholding its validity. the second ground is that the sentence imposed by the court of appeal was for a term of imprisonment that had expired. that ground, and the remainder of the applicant’s submissions, are no more than a van wakeren v the chief executive of the department of corrections [2014] nzsc65. van wakeren vthe chief executive of the departmentof corrections [2014] nzsc 79 [24 june2014] continuation of the arguments he put to the court which were rejected in its judgment.

[2] first, he seeks leave to appeal against a judgment of venning j in the high court which upheld a judgment of an associate judge striking out as an abuse of process a claim by mr prasad seeking to re-litigate issues already determined by the rajendraprasad vindianapublications (nz) limited [2014] nzsc 78 courts.1 venning j also directed the registrar not to accept for filing any further purported proceedings from the applicant relating to the issues of breach of copyright or costs that had led to the applicant’s bankruptcy. [3] mr prasad also applies for leave to appeal against two decisions of wild j in the court of appeal directing the registrar not to accept documents that the applicant had endeavoured to file. in both decisions, wild j ordered that the registrar not accept any further papers from the applicant without prior leave of a judge. [4] the background to these matters is the applicant’s desire to challenge a district court judgment in copyright litigation which was adverse to him, the propriety of subsequent costs orders in that proceeding, and the appellate courts’ eventual refusal to entertain the applicant’s attempts to re-litigate final judgments on these matters. he also seeks to challenge earlier decisions of this court refusing leave to appeal against the original judgments entered against him.2 [5] none of the applications raises a question of general or public importance or other ground making it necessary in the interests of justice to hear and determine the proposed appeal. in particular, although the outcome of the copyright and bankruptcy proceedings has been frustrating and burdensome for the applicant, there is no indication that a substantial miscarriage of justice will occur if the appeal is not heard. [6] as well, in relation to the application against the judgment of venning j, there are no exceptional circumstances that would justify a direct appeal to the supreme court. [7] accordingly each of theapplications for leave to appeal is dismissed. 1 prasad v attorney-general [2013] nzhc 2721. 2 prasad v indiana publications (nz) ltd [2010] nzsc 60; and prasad v indiana publications (nz) ltd [2012] nzsc 43.

[3] on 13 june 2014 the parties were advised by minute that a judgment of the full court, which was to issue that day, would likely be determinative of mr austin’s challenge, even if the court were to grant leave for that to be made out of time. the 1 austin v yoobee limited [2013] nzeraauckland 504. benjamin john austin vyoobee limited nzempc auckland [2014] nzempc 105 [20 june 2014] full court judgment referred to is h v a limited.2 the registry supplied copies of this judgment to the parties. having considered his position as he was invited to by the court’s minute of 13 june 2014, mr austin has nevertheless advised the registry that he wishes to proceed with his application. [4] mr austin’s application for leave to challenge outoftime is dismissed. that is because s 179(5) of the employment relations act 2000 (the act), as interpreted by the full court in h v a limited, precludes statutorily a litigant from challenging a determination of the authority about its procedure. determining that proposed evidence is inadmissible is amatterof the authority’s procedure. the scheme ofthe act is for the authority to get on and determine the proceeding on its merits. if mr austin is dissatisfied with the authority’s substantive determination of his grievance, hewillhavea right ofchallengebyhearingdenovo. in thecourseofthis,hewillbe entitled to re-argue the question of the admissibility of the evidence which the authority has refused to consider. thus, the authority’s determination on the inadmissibility of the evidence does not create an irrevocable injustice for mr austin. [5] for the foregoing reasons, the application for leave to challenge out of time is refused. yoobee limited may be entitled to an order for costs on this application. it may, however, be significant, in determining such an application, that the law was, until a week ago, uncertain on the question of whether parties are entitled to challenge preliminaryauthoritydeterminations on admissibility of evidence.

[3] mrmoroneyadvances two grounds in support ofthe application. thefirst is based upon what he says is the strength of mr mcquillan’s appeal. as has been said frequentlybyjudges of this court, it is neither necessarynor appropriate to carryout a detailed analysis of the merits of an appeal when determining a bail application. it is sufficient to observe that mr mcquillan must show that his prospects of success are strong. he relies heavily upon the fresh evidence of two witnesses, mswilliamson and ms o’brien. having reviewed the brief affidavits filed byboth witnesses, i am not satisfied that they show, at this preliminary stage, that the merits of mr mcquillan’s appeal are strong. [4] second, mr moroney emphasises that there is a suitable address and family support available should mr mcquillan be granted bail. this factor does not of itself carryanyweight.

[3] under thecourt ofappeal (civil) rules 2005, there is noprescribed method for the delivery of interlocutory orders which can be, and often are, noted in handwritingon the file. theapplicant relies on the publicrecords act 2005 but this merely requires that full and accurate records are maintained. moreover, where an application in a case raises an issue that is identical to the issue raised in a previous case, a judge is entitled to refer to the reasoning in the earlier case as the basis for his or her decision in the present case rather than setting out again the full reasoning. we therefore see no point of law of public orgeneral importance. as well there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice. solicitors: crown lawoffice,wellingtonfor second respondent

[3] the principles relating to the discretion to dispense with security for costs have been reformulated in the judgment of this court in reekie v attorney-general.3 the proposed appeal thus does not raise any question of public or general importance. in his judgment, stevens j accepted, at least by implication, that the applicant was impecunious. as it turns out, however, the applicant could have provided security as he received an acc payment of $8,001 early this year. in those circumstances, we can see no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.

[3] the three questions posed by the authority were: (1) did the authority err in law when holding s 10 of the act as directed towards determining residence requirements in s 8(b) and (c) of the act? greenfield v the chief executive of the ministry of social development [2014] nzhc 1199 [30 may 2014] (2) did the authority err in law by holding that a missionary must show that her settled life is in new zealand and absences from new zealand are temporary, in order to be considered “ordinarily resident” in new zealand? (3) did the authority err in law in its application of the meaning of “ordinarily resident in new zealand” to mrs greenfield’s situation? [4] i answered all three questions “yes”. [5] i am satisfied that the issues raised by the questions i answered meet the criteria for leave to appeal to the court of appeal.

[2] mr butler has now purported to file an application for leave to appeal to the court of appeal. given the fact that i have not made any substantive decision, there are no grounds for leave to be granted. mr butler will, of course, have a direct right of appeal to the court of appeal once any substantive decision on his application is given.

[2] having convicted him, judge macdonald sentenced him to 40 hours community work and six months’ disqualification from driving. [3] it appears that the only point raised on the conviction appeal arose out of the fact that the judge dealt with the matter in the absence of a witness whom mryeates wished to call. the witness was unavailable when the matter was dealt with on 19 march, although on the previous day when the matter was mentioned mryeates had indicated that he would be ready to proceed on 19 march. [4] the judge dealt with that eventuality on the basis that he heard the prosecution evidence and then adjourned the case for resumption on 31 march, a date when he understood mryeates’ witness would be present. [5] on 31 march, however, mryeates advised the judge that the witness could not attend due to an appointment with a doctor and referred to a letter dated 5 march confirming that was the case. [6] the question that would have arisen on the appeal is whether in the circumstances there had been a breach of mryeates’rights pursuant to s 25(f) of the new zealandbill ofrights act 1990 to callwitnesses in his defence. however, the case has been called today and mryeates has not appeared nor has he provided submissions in support of his appeal or given anyexplanation for his absence today. [7] in the circumstances ms sheridan has suggested that i should treat the appeal as abandoned, but i think the proper course to follow is to dismiss it for want of prosecution and it is dismissed accordingly.

[2] the charge arises following an extensive police operation relating to alleged methamphetamine manufacture and associated drug offending. the other accused face particular charges relating to the manufacture, possession and supply of drugs, but there is no specific count alleging any offending by mr lavea. [3] in his submissions in support of the application, mr morison indicated that he has approached the police and crown counsel on a number of occasions in order to establish precisely what role the applicant is said to have played in the alleged criminal group and, in particular, what evidence the crown relies upon as proof. at the time he filed his submissions on 12 may 2014, mr morison had received no relevant information. [4] ms pollett for the crown says that the application and what the crown considers “relevant evidence” have been reviewed and the application for a discharge is no longer opposed. i know no more than i have just explained about why mr lavea was named in the indictment in the first place, but it is plain that the crown does not offer any evidence in support of the one charge he faces. [5] accordingly, i order that mr lavea be discharged forthwith under s 347 of the crimes act 1961. orders under that section are required to be made in open court. this matter is to be called in the callover on wednesday, 4 june 2014 for that purpose. mr lavea’s attendance is excused. ……………………………… toogood j

[2] pursuant to that authorisation the plaintiff applies for an order putting the trust board into liquidation and that the official assignee be appointed as liquidator. the reason for the application is the financial position of the trust board. in 2013 it became apparent to the board that it had a deficiency in income relative to expenditure. after full consideration and taking professional advice it reached the wood v prisoners aid and rehabilitation trust [2014] nzhc 1077 [21 may 2014] view that that most appropriate course was to cease to operate. the trust board discussed that position with the department of corrections, its primary stakeholder. as a result of that discussion the trust board did not cease to operate immediately, so as to ensure that services it provided to prisoners would continue in the short term and alternative arrangements could be considered by the department. the trust board and the department agreed that the trust board’s services would continue until 31 january 2014. the present position, as set out in a balance sheet dated 30 november 2013, is that there is a small surplus of assets over liabilities. however this is not a final balance sheet and there may be further creditors who are yet to submit invoices. [3] the application has been advertised. no party has filed any defence or opposition or appeared in opposition to the application at the hearing. the evidence is that liquidation has been carefully considered as the appropriate course in light of the financial position. i am satisfied that it is just and equitable that the trust board be put into liquidation.1 [4] accordingly the defendant trust board is put into liquidation as at 10.17 am on 20 may 2014 and the official assignee is appointed to act as liquidator. the official assignee should note that, although the registered office of the defendant is in wellington, the records of the defendant are principally maintained in christchurch. mallon j charitable trusts act 1957, s 25.

[4] hehas sincedoneso. accordingto the statutorydeclaration, the trust has no fixed assets and no cash. its only asset is the disputed debt at issue in the litigation. [5] the trust’s financial position was plainly relevant and the deputy registrar was correct to decline waiver in the absence of any information about it. had the information been made available at the outset, the decision would have been different.

[2] on 27 january 2014, mr kemp was found not guilty of a charge of refusing to give a blood specimen.1 he was found guilty of careless of a motor vehicle.2 at the conclusion of the hearing mr kemp applied for costs in relation to the charge of refusing to give a specimen of blood.

[6] accordingly, i believe i must allow mr kemp’s appeal and remit his application for costs back to judge mackintosh for her to reconsider. i make this order pursuant to s 274(d) of the criminal procedure act 2011. 3 may v may (1982) 1 nzflr 165 (ca); b v r [2011] nzca 331 at [9]; lawrence v r [2011] nzca 272 at [11]. ____________________ d b collins j solicitors: crown solicitor, napier for respondent
