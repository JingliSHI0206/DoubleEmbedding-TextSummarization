IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2015-485-556 [2016] NZHC 91  BETWEEN ANZ BANK NEW ZEALAND LIMITED Plaintiff  AND VINCENT CHARLES BLACKBURN Defendant  Hearing: 15 December 2015  Counsel: S U Gunawardana for the Plaintiff No appearance for the Defendant  Judgment: 5 February 2016  JUDGMENT OF ASSOCIATE JUDGE SMITH  [1] The plaintiff’s summary judgment application was heard on 15 December 2015. No affidavit of service had been filed by the time of the hearing, but Ms Gunawardana did have a copy of an affidavit showing that service had been effected on 15 October 2015. In those circumstances I proceeded with the hearing on the basis that the original affidavit of service was to be filed promptly, and I would then give judgment on the papers.  [2] The original affidavit of service is now to hand, and I am satisfied that the plaintiff has shown that Mr Blackburn has no defence to its claim, and that summary judgment should be entered.  [3] Accordingly, I enter summary judgment for the plaintiff as follows:  (a) The sum of $100,811.46; and  ANZ BANK NEW ZEALAND LIMITED v VINCENT CHARLES BLACKBURN [2016] NZHC 91 [5 February 2016]  (b)  interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum under s 87 of the Judicature Act 1908, calculated from 6 May 2014 to the date of this judgment, in the sum of $8,009.79; and   (c)  Costs in the sum of $6,882, plus disbursements as fixed by the registrar.

The applicants and the father of Tanya and Suzana Maich, Ivan Maich, are the registered proprietors of the land contained in Certificate of Title 230488 with the trustees holding the land on trust for the familyTrust.  [2] Ivan Maich became affected by Alzheimer’s type dementia in 2008 and retired as a trustee of the Trust but lacks the capacity to execute the necessary documentation to transfer his registered interest in the land to the current trustees.  [3] The trustees wish to sell the land but due to the requirements of Land Information New Zealand, the applicants are unable to transfer the land without first vesting the land in the current trustees to the exclusion of the respondent.  [4] I am satisfied on the evidence that the respondent is so incapacitated as to be unable to take any part in the necessary transactions and further that the transfer into the names of the current trustees is an appropriate step prior to the sale of the property.  [5] AccordinglyI make the following orders:  (a)  Leave is granted to the applicants to bring the application under Part 19 of the High Court Rules.   (b)  Furtherservice of theproceedings dispensed with.

[2] The sole shareholder and director of Rotokohu Investments is Mr Graeme Boddy, who is a United Kingdom resident. Mr Boddy applies for leave to issue this proceeding as an originating application and seeks orders restoring Rotokohu Investments to the Register of Companies on the basis that Mr Thomas Ryan, a New Zealand resident who is known to him, has consented to become a director of the company.  [3] The application is not opposed by the Registrar of Companies or the Treasury.  [4] I am satisfied on the papers that it is proper to grant leave to bring the application and to make the orders sought.  [5] Accordingly I order:  (a)  the plaintiff shall have leave to bring the proceeding by originating application under Part 19 of the High Court Rules;  and   (b)  there will be an order under s 329(1) of the Companies Act 1993 that Rotokohu Investments Limited be restored to the New Zealand Register of Companies.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Date……………  Solicitors: WebsterLaw,Auckland  [1] Jenny Margaret Paine applies to the Court, by way of originating application under s 52 of the Trustee Act 1956, for orders retiring her husband Cecil Richard Paine as a trustee of certain family trusts, appointing a new trustee, and vesting the titles to two properties in the name of the new trustees.  [2] The application is made because Mr Paine is mentally incapable and no longer competent to act as a trustee.  [3] I am satisfied on the papers that Mrs Paine and the two sons of her marriage are the only beneficiaries under the Trusts and that they consent to the appointment of a new trustee and that no other interested parties need to be served. I am also satisfied that Mr Paine can no longer continue in the role of trustee.  [4] Accordingly, I make the following orders under ss 51 and 52 of the Trustee Act 1956:  (a)  an order pursuant to the Court’s inherent jurisdiction removing Cecil Richard Paine as a trustee of The Ric & Jenny Trust, The Jenny Paine Trust and The Richard Paine Trust;   (b)  an order appointingPhilippa Jane DunphyofAuckland, Director, as a new trustee of the Trusts;   (c)  vesting in the names of Jenny Margaret Paine and Philippa Jane Dunphy –   (i)  the property at 30 Audrey Road, Milford, Auckland (CT NZ364/109) presently held byThe Ric & JennyTrust;  and   (ii)  Lot 34 DP 4961, Kawau Island, presently held by The Jenny Paine Trust as to a ½ share and The Richard Paine Trust as to a ½ share.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA675/2015 [2015] NZCA 634  BETWEEN KERRYN MITCHELL Appellant  AND THE QUEEN Respondent   Counsel: Appellant in person Crown Law Office for the Respondent  Judgment: 21 December 2015 (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF HARRISON J (Application for Bail)  [1] The appellant, Kerryn Mitchell, was convicted in the District Court at Wellington on charges of attempting to contravene a protection order, threatening to kill and contravening a protection order. Judge Kelly sentenced her to a term of two years and three months imprisonment.    [2] Ms Mitchell has appealed to this Court against her conviction and sentence.  [3] Ms Mitchell has applied for bail pending determination of her appeal pursuant to s 70 of the Bail Act 2000, which I have considered pursuant to s 393(2)(d) of the CrimesAct 1961.   [4] The Bail Act provides that bail is not to be granted unless the Court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it would be in the best interests of justice in the particular case. Ms Mitchell has the onus of showing cause why bail should be granted.   MITCHELLV R [2015] NZCA634[21December 2015]  [5] I note that Ms Mitchell’s notice of appeal recites that her counsel is Christopher Tennet. However, Ms Mitchell herself has filed the application for bail on 16 December 2015. The application does not provide any grounds in support.  On 17 December a member of the Registry communicated a message to Ms Mitchell that anyfurther submissions are to be filed in writing as soon as possible.  [6] Ms Mitchell has advised the Registry that she has been deprived of access to facilities which would enable her to prepare written submissions. I am unable to comment on that allegation. The attention of the prison authorities is drawn to their statutory obligation to cooperate and make facilities available to prison inmates whenever they are reasonably requested.  [7] For present purposes I record that Ms Mitchell has failed to satisfy her statutory onus and her application for bail pending determination of her appeal is dismissed.

NOTE:  HIGH COURT ORDER PROHIBITINGPUBLICATION OFNAMES AND ADDRESSES OFTHE PARTIES REMAINS IN FORCE.  IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  CA461/2014 [2015] NZCA 625  BETWEEN NR Applicant  AND DISTRICT COURTATAUCKLAND First Respondent  MR Second Respondent  Counsel: Applicant (in person) R J Hollyman and AJB Holmes for Second Respondent  Judgment: 18 December 2015 at 11.00 am (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OFMILLER J (Review of Registrar’s decision)  The application for review of the Registrar’s decision concerning security for costs is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] NR moves for a review of the Registrar’s decision to dispense with security for costs on MR’s cross-appeal. She reasoned that NR is unrepresented and therefore is not entitled to security for costs.   [2] NR says that he has instructed a lawyer to represent him on the cross-appeal.  He explains the lawyer’s absence from the record bysaying that he is not prepared to spend money on a lawyer unless he is sure that he has security for costs.  NR V DISTRICTCOURTATAUCKLAND &ANOR [2015] NZCA625[18 December 2015]  [3] The decision was manifestly correct. Only when a practising solicitor appears on the record for NR and takes responsibility for the appeal would it be appropriate to consider revisiting the Registrar’s decision. Costs are payable only in respect of steps taken bya lawyer in a proceeding.  [4] I reject as unfounded NR’s allegations that the Registrar is biased against him.  Her decision was entirely appropriate.  [5] The application for review of the Registrar’s decision concerning security for costs is dismissed.

PUBLICATION IN LAW REPORT OR LAW DIGEST PERMITTED.  IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 131/2015 [2015] NZSC 199   BETWEEN  THE QUEEN Applicant   AND  VERDUN ASHLEY PERRY Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, Glazebrook and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  P D Marshall forApplicant S G Bailey and E Huda for Respondent   Judgment:  18 December 2015    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is granted [Perry v R [2015] NZCA 530].  B The approved question is whether the Court of Appeal was right to find that:  (a)  the statements made by Mr Perry in his video interview after the interview re-commenced at 4 pm on 4 June 2014; and   (b)  evidence of the walk-through of the scene and the further statements made by Mr Perry to police on 6 June 2014    are inadmissible against Mr Perry at trial.  R vVERDUNASHLEYPERRY[2015] NZSC 199[18 December 2015]  REASONS  [1] This is a pre-trial appeal. It raises some important issues of principle. It is the type of case which we would generally expect to be argued by senior counsel. We invite counsel to consider whether the appointment of senior counsel for the appeal is appropriate.  [2] We understand that Mr Perry’s trial is due to begin in Christchurch in the week beginning 7 March 2016. Since the Court is unlikely to be able to deal with the appeal before March, steps should be taken to defer the trial.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,WellingtonforApplicant 
IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  CA633/2015 [2015] NZCA 626   BETWEEN CHESTERFIELDS PRESCHOOLS LIMITED Applicant  AND THE COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE Respondent  Counsel: TA Sisson forApplicant S Kinsler for Respondent  Judgment: 17 December 2015 at 3.00 pm (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OFHARRISON J  The application for review of the Registrar’s decision declining an application for fee waiver is dismissed.   REASONS  [1] On 2 November 2015 Chesterfield Preschools Limited (CPL) appealed to this Court against a decision of the High Court at Christchurch on 6 October 2015. Its notice of appeal was accompanied byan application to waiver the filing fee.  [2] On 10 November 2015 the Registrar requested CPL to provide further information in support ofthe feewaiverapplication by24 November 2015. CPLdid not respond to the Registrar’s request. On 4 December the Registrar formally declined the fee waiver application.  CHESTERFIELDS PRESCHOOLS LIMITED VTHE COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE [2015] NZCA626 [17 December 2015]  [3] On 15 December 2015 CPL applied to review the Registrar’s decision. The grounds for CPL’s application, made in a memorandum filed by Therese Sisson, are difficult to follow. As best I can discern them, they are that Ms Sisson cannot pay the fee. However, Ms Sisson is not the appellant. Her financial circumstances are irrelevant.  [4] Iadd that Ms Sisson does not appear to havea current practising certificate as a barrister and solicitor and thus has no apparent standing to represent CPL.  [5] Ms Sisson also refers to a public interest ground to support waiver. However, on analysis the ground is no more than an assertion that the appeal has merit.  [6] CPL has failed to establish an error by the Registrar or any independent ground for a fee waiver. Its request to review her decision declining its application for a fee waiver is dismissed.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY   CIV 2015-485-614729   [2015] NZHC 3283   IN THE MATTER OF  the estate ofTAMALI'I TANUVASA   PEPE MAUA TUPUOLA   Applicant   On the papers    Judgment: 1 7 December 2015  JUDGMENT OF MALLON J   [1] Ms Pepe Tupuola (the applicant) applies for a grant of letters of administration. The grant is sought in respect of the estate of Tamali'i Tanuvasa, who was the applicant's sister. The application was declined by the Registrar on the ground that it should have been made by the two daughters of the deceased. The applicant seeks review of that decision. The review has been referred to me for consideration.  [2] The deceased died intestate. The deceased was survived by two children (Mele Tanuvasa and Merita Iopu) and six brothers and sisters (one of whom is the applicant). The gross value ofthe estate does not exceed $20,000. It is comprised of Kiwisaver funds of slightly over $15,000 and the balance is held in a Westpac current account. The provider of the Kiwisaver funds requires letters of administration.  [3] Pursuant to s 77 of the Administration Act 1969 (the Act), the children (Ms Tanuvasa and Ms Iopu) are the beneficiaries of the estate. They have each sworn affidavits. They are 41 and 42 years old respectively. They both reside in Western Samoa. They each understand that they are entitled to apply to be the  Estate ofTamali'i Tanuvasa [2015] NZHC 3283 [17 December 2015]  administrator of their mother's estate. They do not wish to do so. They have each signed a formal consent for the applicant to be appointed. The five other siblings of the deceased have all been given notice of the applicant's intention to apply for the grant and none have objected.  [4] The grant of administration is sought pursuant to s 6(2) of the Act. That permits the Court to grant administration to such person as it thinks expedient by reason of special circumstances, notwithstanding that some other person would by law be entitled to a grant of administration. 1 The special circumstances relied on are as follows:  (a)  The two persons beneficially interested in the estate reside out of New Zealand, do not wish to apply for administration, and consent to the application made.   (b)  The applicant is the deceased 's sister. She is familiar with the deceased's affairs. The five other siblings of the deceased have not objected to the application.   ( c) The estate is small.   ( d) An alternative would be for the beneficiaries to appoint the applicant as attorney. This involves disproportionate cost, given the size of the estate, and the beneficiaries do not want to apply for letters of administration.     [5] The application has been made on proper grounds. The applicant has made all the appropriate inquiries. The grounds are suppmied by the material presented to the Comi. I am satisfied that there are special circumstances making it appropriate to grant the application under s 6(2) ofthe Act.  [6] Accordingly the grant of letters of administration to the applicant }s made. /  . ii·.  0J~    . \. i \.  \~llonJ  See Re Jones [1973] 2 NZLR 402.   
IN THE SUPREME COURT OFNEWZEALAND  SC 137/2015  [2015] NZSC 193   BETWEEN  MATTHEW JOHN YOUNG   Applicant   AND  THE DISTRICT COURTAT HAMILTON   Respondent   Counsel:  Applicant in person   Judgment:  16 December 2015    JUDGMENT OFWILLIAMYOUNG J  The application for interim order suppressing publication of the applicant’s name is dismissed.   REASONS  [1] The applicant is facing dishonesty charges in the District Court on which he is to be tried in April next year. He was charged in February 2013 and initially obtained an interim order suppressing publication of his name. This order was discharged in October 2013.1 Since then he has continued to seek name suppression. There have been a number of appeals or applications for leave to appeal and as a result, associated interim orders for suppression have continued to this day; this despite no Court since October 2013 having been persuaded that such an order was appropriate pending trial.  [2] Presently in issue are (a) a third application for suppression which was filed in the District Court and dismissed on 6 October 2015 as an abuse of process2,  (b)associated judicial review proceedings which were dismissed by Moore J on  1 R v Young DCHamilton CRI-2013-019-946, 25 October 2013 (Judge Marshall). 2 R v Young [2015] NZDC 19709.  MATTHEWJOHNYOUNGvTHE DISTRICTCOURTATHAMILTON [2015] NZSC 193[16 December 2015]  30 October 20153 and (c) an appeal to the Court of Appeal from that judgment and the refusal by the Court of Appeal to continue to suppress publication of the applicant’s name pending determination of that appeal.4 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the last decision and a further interim order suppressing publication of his name pending determination of that appeal.  [3] Ihave read the judgments ofMooreJ and ofthe Court ofAppeal. TheCourt of Appeal was of the view that the appeal against Moore J’s judgment was not seriously arguable. I regard the reasons given by that Court as convincing and I am not persuaded that there is sufficient merit in the appeal to that Court or the proposed appeal to this Court to warrant the making of a further order suppressing publication of the applicant’s name.   [4] The application for such an order is accordingly declined.  3 Young v District Court [2015]NZHC 2677. 4 Young v District Court [2015]NZCA584 (Randerson, French and KòsJJ).

Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date.............. .  Solicitors: Jespersen & Associates, Auckland Auckland Family Law Ltd, Auckland  Lee v Torrey [2015] NZHC 3261 [16 December 2015]  [1] In my judgment of 13 November 2015 I reserved quantification of the amount of interest to be incorporated in the judgment. I set a time for submissions on same. That time has now passed. No opposition to the plaintiff's calculation has been lodged. I am satisfied that the plaintiff's calculation is correct.  [2] Quantification of interest due to 18 November 2015 has been calculated at $28,303.01. That figure increases at the rate of $8.20 per day until the day of entry of judgment. I am therefore satisfied that it is appropriate that judgment for interest to today's date should now be entered. That is calculated as follows:  Amount to 18 November 2015 $28,303.01  Plus 28 days at $8.20 per day 229.60  Total interest $28,532.61  [3] Accordingly, I enter judgment for interest in the sum of $28,532.61.  [4] Mr Locke has produced an amended schedule showing costs calculated on a 2B basis, plus disbursements. I adopt that calculation. Accordingly, judgment for costs in the sum of $49,506, plus disbursements of $5,249.53 is entered against the defendants.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND ROTORUA REGISTRY CRI-2014-070-4650 [2015] NZHC 3077  THE QUEEN  v  HIAKITA HORI ERUERA PAUL WILLIAM TAKI HYACIN ERUERA  Hearing: 30 November 2015  Appearances: G C Hollister-Jones and A J Pollett for Crown E R Fairbrother QC and M M Dorset for Hiakita Eruera R M Adams and N M Dutch for Taki A C Balme and T Bailey for Hyacin Eruera  Ruling: 7 December 2015  RULING (No.4) OF WHATA J [Evidence of Mr Waititi]  This judgment was delivered by Justice Whata on 7 December 2015 at 10.00 a.m, pursuant to r 11.5 of the High Court Rules  Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date:   Solicitors: Crown Solicitor, Tauranga E R Fairbrother QC, Napier Adams Law, Tauranga A C Balme, Tauranga  R v ERUERA, TAKI, ERUERA [2015] NZHC 3077 [7 December 2015]  [1] Mr Hollister-Jones in re-examination sought to put to Mr Waititi his second statement made to the police. Mr Waititi had been cross-examined on his first statement by Mr Fairbrother. In that cross-examination Mr Waititi accepted that he had said he was not “100 percent sure” that he saw Mr Eruera carrying a knife or that he saw the blade. This statement was inconsistent with the evidence given by Mr Waititi in Court in which he was categorical that he had seen a knife handle and blade.   [2] Mr Hollister-Jones submitted that it was appropriate to put the subsequent statement to Mr Waititi to complete the interview record. Mr Fairbrother objected that this was not a proper use of s 35(2) of the Evidence Act 2006 and that his  challenge to Mr Waititi’s evidence went to credibility rather than veracity or  accuracy. He said in short that the inconsistency between the first statement and the evidence in Court revealed a contrived account and that by putting the first statement to him he has shown this to the jury.  [3] Section 35(2) states:  (2) A previous statement of a witness that is consistent with the witness's evidence is admissible to the extent that the statement is necessary to respond to a challenge to the witness's veracity or accuracy, based on a previous inconsistent statement of the witness or on a claim of recent invention on the part of the witness.  [4] Tipping J relevantly set the frame for admission of prior consistent statements in this way:1  [37] While the veracity or accuracy of evidence given in court is not necessarily enhanced because of repetition, the policy of the subsection is that in qualifying circumstances, of which the Judge is the gatekeeper, it is significant that a witness has said the same thing before. The trier of fact should be aware of that fact and assess its weight in the light of all the relevant circumstances  [38] It is important however, to reiterate that a general attack on a witness’s  veracity or accuracy is not enough to trigger the operation of subs (2). The attack must be based either on a previous inconsistent statement or on a claim of recent invention. Conceptually the former is quite straightforward.  Hart v R [2010] NZSC 91; [2011] 1 NZLR 1.  [5] Mr Fairbrother, quite properly in my view, conceded that the section literally applied in this case. I am also satisfied that the question about the second statement can be properly put to Mr Waititi to complete the record of his interviews and to respond to a challenge to the accuracy of his evidence. Insofar as this touches upon  his credibility, that might be so, but it was quite plain to me that Mr Waititi’s  accuracy was also challenged by Mr Fairbrother in putting his first statement to him.  [6] In those circumstances I considered that s 35(2) was properly in play and I directed that Mr Hollister-Jones could put the question to Mr Waititi.

Mr Wu sought leave to file a reply to Mrs Moncur’s defences, under s 39 of the Defamation Act 1992, out oftime. Igranted the application. Both parties sought costs, which arethe subject of this judgment.  [2] Mr Wu was granted an indulgence by the Court and I consider that, in this context, he should not receive costs for having done so. Mrs Moncur’s opposition lacked substance and came in the context of her having previously received a significant indulgence from the Court in respect of which costs were awarded against her.  Mrs Moncur is self-represented so is not entitled to the award of costs.  [3] Accordingly, I order that costs lie where theyfall.  ..................................................................

The respondents now seek costs. The applicants resist, on the basis that, had steps been taken to apply for specific performance earlier they would not have been forced into the position of having to apply to remove the caveat.  [2] It is generally the position that costs follow the event but, ultimately, the Judge retains a discretion. This is one of those cases in which I consider that costs should be reserved rather than fixed now. There are two reasons for this. The first is that relied on by the applicants; they have been left in the position of being unable to deal with their property while the first respondent has done nothing to advance matters towards a proper resolution of the obvious dispute between them. Even in the face of the application for an order to remove the caveat the first respondent did nothing to advance matters. Secondly, the dispute will ultimately involve a significant credibility contest between the applicants and the third respondent. If the applicants prevail at trial any costs fixed now will need to be re-visited. In these circumstances I consider it preferable for both parties that costs be reserved and fixed when the outcome of the substantive dispute is known.  P Courtney J

NRTvRB [2015] NZHC 3053[2December 2015]  [1] I heard this appeal on 2 December 2015 and indicated that, given the time of year, it was likely that I would deliver my judgment with reasons to follow. This I now do.  [2] The appeal is allowed. The decision of Judge Pidwell of 12 May 2015 is set aside.  I will deliver written reasons as soon as possible.  [3] The result of allowing the appeal is that Ms T will have day-to-day care of the children in Dunedin. Clearly, however, further orders will be required to determine the date on which the new care arrangements will begin and to agree on arrangements for the childrens’ future contact with Mr B. I direct that there be a telephone conference with me for this purpose at 9 am on Wednesday, 9 December 2015. Counsel and Mr B should confer prior to that conference to see if agreement can be reached.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY   CIV-2014-485-11449   [2015] NZHC 3048   BETWEEN  MILTON RAYMOND FERNANDES   Appellant   AND  ALYLUZ PALACIO FERNANDES   Respondent   On the papers:    Counsel: K Lakshman for Appellant T W Davis for Respondent  Judgment: 3 December 2015  JUDGMENT OF WILLIAMS (COSTS)  [1] The respondent seeks costs. The appellant submits there is no jurisdiction to make the award, this Court being functus officio.  [2] Despite Fogarty J's decision in Wilson v Selwyn District Council 1, I am ofthe view that once the judgment is sealed this Court is functus officio and can make no further orders with respect to the proceeding. I did not reserve costs, nor was I asked to. Judgment was sealed on 18 June 2015. The authorities cited by Mr Lakshman2 correctly state the law in this respect.  [3] Even if that is wrong, I would have let costs lie where they fall as, I understand it, they had in the Family Court. Although the judgment reads as a comprehensive loss for the appellant, a number of the points raised were clearly arguable and the law in key areas in the appeal had not previously been dealt with in the High Court.

REASONS  [1] In a decision dated 28 October 2015, this Court dismissed Mr and Mrs Banks’ application for leave to appeal to this Court against a decision of the Court of Appeal.1  [2] On 2 November 2015, Mr and Mrs Banks filed a memorandum which was, in substance, an application for recall of this Court’s judgment. On 4 and 9 November 2015, Mr and Mrs Banks filed two supplementarymemoranda.  [3] By judgment dated 11 November 2015, this Court rejected the recall application on the basis that it mirrored their application for leave to appeal and attempted to re-argue the points dismissed in this Court’s leave judgment.2  Banks v Grey District Council [2015] NZSC 158.  DOUGLAS BANKS AND CHRISTINE SANDRABANKS v GREYDISTRICTCOUNCIL[2015] NZSC 183 [1 December 2015]  [4] By e-mail dated 23 November 2015, Mr and Mrs Banks contacted the Registry of this Court and asked if the Court would address the second and third memoranda that were filed with respect to the above recall application.  We will treat this letter as a second application for recall.   [5] While this Court did not specifically mention the two additional memoranda in its recall judgment, the Court considered all the material submitted by Mr and Mrs Banks in dismissing the application.  [6] All three memoranda attempted to re-argue points that were the subject of the application for leave to appeal. The criteria for recall are not met and the application is dismissed.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY   CIV-2015-485-717   [2015] NZHC 2931   UNDER  Section 164 of the Companies Act 1993   IN THE MATTER  ofan application for an injunction   restraining a breach of the constitution of   Dorchester Apattments Ltd   BETWEEN  ALEXANDER HILL BRUCE   THOMSON AND RICHARD NORMAN   MARTIN   Plaintiffs   AND  DORCHESTERAPARTMENTS LTD   Defendant   On the papers    Counsel: C Matsis for Plaintiffs G J Toebes for Defendant  Judgment: 23 November 2015  JUDGMENT OF CLIFFORD J (COSTS)  [1] I have received and considered the memoranda on costs.  [2] In my judgment of 9 October 2015, I concluded by saying I saw no reason why costs should not follow the event.  [3] I remain of that view. The question that I think does need to be considered, however, is Mr Toebes' submission that, in the circumstances, payment of costs should await the outcome of the substantive proceeding. I recognise of course that the Rules provide as Mr Matsis has con-ectly pointed out for costs on interlocutory applications normally to be dealt with at the time those applications are resolved. However, that is not a universal rule.  [4] The defendant, Dorchester Apartments Ltd, represents all the owners of apartments in the Dorchester complex. It is not, itself, in that sense a separate business entity. This is essentially a dispute between owners. Questions of the need to raise funds to meet the award could arise. A costs order against the company would, indirectly, also appear to involve the plaintiffs paying costs to themselves.  [5] In these unusual circumstances, I think the award and payment of costs is best left until the resolution of the substantive proceeding.  [6] I therefore decline the plaintiffs' application at this time.  Solicitors: Gault Mitchell Law, Wellington for Plaintiffs JT Law, Wellington for Defendant  
         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  NELSON REGISTRY    CIV-2015-442-72  [2015] NZHC 2921       UNDER     the Trustee Act 1956      IN THE MATTER OF     an application by Richard James Davies and Jonathan Thomas Davies for a vesting order of land held in trust (Lot 1 DP12443 - CT NL7C/394) pursuant to section 52 Trustee Act 1956      BETWEEN     RICHARD JAMES DAVIES AND JONATHAN THOMAS DAVIES  Plaintiffs      AND     JOHN DOUGLAS CUTTER  Defendant       On papers                Judgment:     23 November 2015         JUDGMENT OF DOBSON J    [1] In this proceeding, the plaintiff trustees seek an order under s 52 of the Trustee Act 1956 vesting the land contained in Certificate of Title NL7C/394 in their joint names as the current trustees of the relevant trust.  The defendant (Mr Cutter) was previously a trustee of the trust, and his name remains on the relevant certificate of title.    [2] Although Mr Cutter is the brother-in-law of the trustee, Richard James Davies, and therefore an uncle of the remaining trustee, Richard’s son Jonathan, Mr Cutter is now entirely alienated from Richard Davies.     [3] Mr Cutter, who is a retired clergyman resident in England, is in poor health and other family members have raised concern that if any request in relation to    Richard Davies was referred to him, his entrenched enmity is such that it would be likely to adversely affect his health.     [4] These unusual circumstances were cited in an application to the Court for directions as to service, the proposal being that the Court could dispense with service on Mr Cutter, given the verification of the situation I have summarised above in affidavits from other family members.    [5] A preliminary concern on considering the papers was the absence of confirmation of consent to the change in the registered owners of the property, from Richard Davies’ former wife (Mrs Helen Morris) who was acknowledged as a contingent beneficiary as to income from the trust.  Before deciding on appropriate directions as to service, I sought clarification of her position.     [6] The plaintiffs have now filed additional affidavits that confirm Mrs Morris’s consent to the transfer.  In that event, I am satisfied that service can be dispensed with entirely.    [7] Having reflected on all the matters raised, I am also satisfied that the relief sought is justified.  I accordingly make the order sought in the statement of claim to vest the land in Certificate of Title NL7C/394 in the joint names of the plaintiffs.     [8] Although the costs of the proceeding are sought, that is not appropriate in circumstances where the defendant’s view is not being sought, so there will be no order as to costs.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  NELSON REGISTRY   CIV 2013-442-174   [2015] NZHC 2893   BETWEEN  IAN WALTON DAVEY, NOVA   ELIZABETH DAVEY AND   CARL JORGENSEN   First Plaintiffs   AND  IAN WALTON DAVEY AND   NOVA ELIZABETH DAVEY   Second Plaintiffs   AND  NICHOLAS DE CHAIR BAKER    Hearing: On Papers Counsel: G W Allan for Plaintiffs G M Downing for Defendant Judgment: 19 November 2015  COSTS JUDGMENT OF BROWN J  [1] Both parties responded commendably promptly to my Minute of 10 November 2015. For the plaintiffs Ms Palmer filed a schedule on 12 November identifying the items in respect of which the plaintiffs take issue with the schedule annexed to the defendants' reply memorandum of 5 November 2015. Mr Downing for the defendants filed a third memorandum, annexing copies of the invoices with reference to the expe1i evidence and the aerial surveys, and a fourth memorandum dated 13 November 2015 responding to the plaintiffs' schedule.  [2] The consequence of the exchange of memoranda was productive inasmuch that the paiiies agree on the amount of total scale 2B costs in the sum of $63,333.00.  DAVEYv BAKER [2015] NZHC 2893 [19 November 2015]  [3] So far as the filing fees, photocopying, facsimiles, LIMs search fees, subpoena expenses and service fees in respect of Mr S Light and the aerial survey photos are concerned, I accept on the basis of the information provided in the defendants' fourth memorandum that all those items are reasonable and they are approved.  [4] With reference to the expe1i witnesses' expenses, I have perused the invoices which are attachments A, Band C to the defendants' third memorandum. I consider that those expenses are reasonable and appropriate and they are also approved.  [5] Accordingly according to my calculations the total costs and disbursements to which the defendants are entitled is $97,673.42.

The document in question is professionally drafted and is in all manner and form a correct will.  [2] An error occurred when the will was signed. Two witnesses were present for the signing by the testator. His wife signed a new will at the same time and in front of the same witnesses. Unfortunately one ofthe witnesses failed to actually sign the testator's will which accordingly has only the one signature.  [3] An affidavit has been filed from the witness who omitted to sign the will. He is a Welsh solicitor who deposes that he saw the will signed in the presence of himself and the other witnesses.  ESTATE OF ROWLANDS  [4] I am satisfied it is an appropriate case for a order under s 14 of the Wills Act 2002 declaring the document called "The last will and testament of John Vernon Morgan Rowlands" and signed by him on 24 June 2010 a valid will.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 102/2015 [2015] NZSC 171   BETWEEN  GARY OWEN BURGESS Applicant   AND  SUSAN NATALIE BEAVEN Respondent    Court: William Young, Glazebrook and O'Regan JJ Counsel: Applicant in person AM Corry for Respondent Judgment: 11 November 2015  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent.    REASONS  [1] The applicant, Mr Burgess, applies for leave to appeal to this Court against a decision of Harrison J.1 In that decision, Harrison J upheld the decision of the Registrar of the Court of Appeal refusing to dispense with security for costs for MrBurgess’appeal to that Court.  [2] Mr Burgess’ underlying appeal to the Court of Appeal relates to a judgment of Nation J in the High Court2 which in turn dismissed his application to waive the  1 Burgess v Beaven [2015] NZCA373. 2 Burgess v Beaven [2015] NZHC 790.  GARYOWEN BURGESS v SUSAN NATALIE BEAVEN [2015] NZSC 171 [11 November 2015]  requirement to give security for costs on his appeal against a decision of the Family Court.3  [3] In reviewing and upholding the Registrar’s decision, Harrison J applied the settled principles set out by this Court in Reekie v Attorney-General.4 Given those principles are settled, Mr Burgess’ application raises no issue of public or general importance. Nothing that Mr Burgess raises in his application for leave to appeal suggests that those principles were wrongly applied and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.

REASONS  [1] In a decision dated 28 October 2015, this Court dismissed Mr and Mrs Banks’ application for leave to appeal to this Court against a decision of the Court of Appeal.1  [2] On 2 November 2015, Mr and Mrs Banks filed a memorandum which is, in substance, an application for recall of this Court’s judgment.  [3] The substance of Mr and Mrs Banks’ recall application mirrors their application for leave to appeal and attempts to re-argue the points dismissed in our leave judgment.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 95/2015 [2015] NZSC 169   BETWEEN  BEVIN HALL SKELTON Applicant   AND  DARAN NAIR Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, William Young and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person E J Werry for Respondent   Judgment:  9 November 2015    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant must pay the respondent costs of $2,500.    REASONS  [1] The applicant, Mr Skelton, seeks leave to appeal against Winkelmann J’s decision dismissing his application for review of the Registrar of the Court of Appeal’s decision refusing a waiver from the requirement to pay security for costs.1 The Judge upheld the Registrar’s decision and ordered that Mr Skelton pay security of$5,880 by28 August 2015. MrSkelton then applied to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time within which to pay security and also applied to this Court for leave to appeal against Winkelmann J’s decision. Although Winkelmann J granted Mr Skelton an extension until 5pm on 4 September 2015, we understand that security has not yet been paid.  Skelton v Nair [2015] NZCA343.  BEVIN HALLSKELTON v DARAN NAIR [2015] NZSC169 [9 November 2015]  [2] It is unnecessary that we set out the background in any detail. It is enough to say that the subject matter of the underlying proceedings goes back to 2006 when MrSkelton and his wife were involved in litigation, which was the subject of settlement agreements in 2008 and 2009. In 2014, Mr Skelton issued proceedings which Asher J struck out on the basis that they were covered by the settlement agreements.2 Mr Skelton appealed against Asher J’s decision, which gave rise to Winkelmann J’s decision as to security for costs.  [3] In Reekie v Attorney-General, this Court set out the approach to be taken to security for costs issues in the Court of Appeal.3 In her decision, Winkelmann J applied the principles set out in Reekie. Accordingly, Mr Skelton’s proposed appeal raises no issue of general or public importance, nor is there any appearance of a substantial miscarriage of justice.  [4] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed. The applicant must pay the respondent costs of $2,500.

The Legal Services Commissioner declined Mr Robertson's application for legal aid.  [2] Mr Robertson sought legal aid in relation to an application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court from a decision of the Court ofAppeal.1 The Court ofAppeal had dismissed an appeal against Mr Robertson's conviction on charges in respect of which he had been prosecuted in the District Court.  R(CA283/2013 v R [2014] NZCA 239. ROBERTSON v LEGAL SERVICES COMMISSIONER [2015] NZHC 2767 [9 November 2015]  [3] In R v R the Supreme Court declined Mr Robertson's application for leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal.2 His application for legal aid is moot and his proceeding in this Court is therefore misconceived.  [4] Mr Robertson's case was called before me in open Court on 9 November 2015. Arrangements were made for Mr Robe1tson to attend the hearing by way of a telephone conference call. Mr Robe1tson addressed the Court for approximately 15 minutes. It is very clear Mr Robertston harbours major misgivings and concerns about his conviction. When asked about whether or not the Supreme Comt had already dismissed his application for leave to appeal the Comt of Appeal judgment, Mr Robe1tson acknowledged this had occun-ed but neve1theless said he was the victim of a grave miscarriage ofjustice.  [5] Mr Robertson's appeal is dismissed. He cannot pursue an appeal declining him legal aid in the circumstances of this case.  [6] No other orders are required.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY  CRI-2015-404-000327 [2015] NZHC 2763   BETWEEN  JOANNE THOMSON Appellant   AND  AUCKLAND COUNCIL Respondent   Hearing:  6 November 2015    Appearances: Baden Meyer for the Appellant Vernon Tamatea for the Respondent  Judgment: 6 November 2015  JUDGMENT OF MOORE J [Appeal against conviction and sentence]  This judgment was delivered by me on 6 November 2015 at 4:45pm pursuant to Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules. Registrar/ Deputy Registrar Date:  THOMSON v AUCKLAND COUNCIL [2015] NZHC 2763 [6 November 2015]  [1] Joanne Thomson appeals her conviction and sentence arising out of a charge laid under s 57(2) of the Dog Control Act 1996.  [2] Her grounds of appeal are that the conviction and sentence were imposed in absentia.  [3] It is accepted by the Auckland Council that as a result of miscommunications, the details of which are not necessary to explore in this judgment, Ms Thomson did not attend the hearing in person and the conviction and sentence were imposed in her absence and without her having an opportunity to advance her defence.  [4] Mr Tamatea, for the Auckland Council, has responsibly accepted that the appeal should be allowed and the matter remitted back to the District Court at Manukau for a rehearing.  [5] In the circumstances I am prepared to follow that course. The appeal is allowed and the conviction and sentence is quashed. I order the matter is to be remitted back to the District Court at Manukau for rehearing.  [6] Mr Meyer, for the appellant, advised he will liaise with the District Court at Manukau to obtain a nominal date in order that this matter can proceed in the normal way at first instance.   
BEFORE THE ENVIRONMENT COURT  Decision [2015] NZEnvC \ 8 9 ENV-2014-WLG-0012, 015, 016 ENV-2015-WLG-003  IN THE MATTER of appeals under Cl 14 of Schedule 1 to the Resource Management Act 1991, and of an appeal under s 120 of that Act  BETWEEN CRESWICK VALLEY RESIDENTS' ASSOCIATION INC PRIME PROPERTY GROUP LTD MPCGIBSON Appellants  AND WELLINGTON CITY COUNCIL Respondent   DECISION APPROVING TERMS OF PLAN CHANGE  Decisions issued:  0 5 NOV 2015  Costs are reserved [l] The Court recorded its substantive decisions on both the Proposed Plan Change and the resource consent appeals in its decision [2015] NZEnvC 149. Since then there have been Minutes and Memoranda between all or some of the parties and the Court in an attempt to resolve issues of detail around conditions and a concept plan. We have taken account of the parties' views in reaching the conclusion contained in this decision.   [2] Without needing to recite all of that background, the last point requiring resolution was the specifying, or not, in the Plan Change of a n01ihern vehicular access point onto the site from Cmiis Street/Whitehead Road. Issues of safety, and of preservation of a planted strip along a good part of the Curtis Street frontage were at front ofmind for the Court.  [3] In his memorandum of 21 October 2015, Mr Jessen for PPG has put forward a solution which, for the purposes of the higher level Plan Change provisions, deals with the issue. That is, he proposes that the Structure Plan should not identify a northern access to the site at all, and the reference to a possible Whitehead Road access be deleted.  [4] That will leave the position of a northern access point to be resolved at the point of decisions about resource consents for future activities on the site -a situation which put the relevant material before the then decision-maker. That will almost certainly produce a more workable and satisfactory result than arguing about it in the abstract. We ask that the final documents be drafted on that basis, for approval.

REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a judgment of the Court ofAppeal upholding a pre-trial ruling that visual identification evidence is admissible against him in relation to charges he faces of aggravated burglary and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodilyharm.1 His trial on thesecharges has yet to take place.  [2] Leave to appeal can only be granted if the Court is satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice to hear the appeal before trial.2 There is nothing in the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant addressing this criterion and  1 Gibbins v R [2015]NZCA462 (Harrison, Dobson and Gilbert JJ). 2 See s13(4)ofthe Supreme Court Act 2003.

On 8 October 2015 he was granted bail by Judge Mahon in the District Court at Papakura. The conditions of bail included conditions that he is:  (a)  not to consume alcohol;   (b)  not to enter licensed premises (other than supermarkets);  and   (c)  to submit to a breath test on request of the police.    [2] Mr Manual appeals against the imposition of those conditions on the basis that they cannot be justified as being relevant to the risks identified in s 8 of the Bail Act 2000.   [3] Counsel for the respondent has noted that there is no record available of the Judge’s notes as the transcription failed in the District Court on the relevant date.  However, this may be approached as a de novo hearing in anyevent.  Counsel for the respondent has accepted that there must be a sufficient nexus between the imposition of the conditions and the risks identified. In terms of the present alleged offending the respondent accepts that the appellant does not appear to have consumed alcohol and alcohol does not seem to have been involved in the alleged offending.  [4] In the circumstances the respondent concedes there is little to indicate the alcohol related conditions bear sufficient nexus to the risks in this case. For those reasons the respondent does not oppose the appeal.   [5] I agree. The appeal is allowed. The existing conditions of bail are varied to delete the conditions referred to at [1] above. The other conditions of bail imposed by the District Court on 8 October remain in full force and effect.  Venning J

Ireserved the questionof costs.1  [2] The second defendant now seeks scale costs. It has filed submissions. MrButler has not filed any submissions in response in the time available. The general principle is that a successful party is entitled to costs.2  [3] There is no reason to depart from this general principle.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 87/2015   [2015] NZSC 154   BETWEEN  CARL JAMES PETERSON   Applicant   AND  ATTORNEY-GENERAL   Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, William Young and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person   K Laurenson and M J McKillop for Respondent   Judgment:  23 October 2015    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent.    REASONS  [1] The applicant, Mr Peterson, seeks leave to appeal directly to this Court against a decision ofAssociate Judge Christiansen striking out proceedings which he brought againstthe Attorney-General.1 In the proceedings, Mr Peterson claimed that his rights under s 27 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 were breached when the High Court made an order for an interim injunction against him and his company, Peterson Portable Sawing Systems Ltd, but did not require the giving of an undertaking as to damages, and that he suffered loss as a consequence. He sought damages in the amount of $3 million.    Peterson v Attorney-General [2015] NZHC 1336.  CARLJAMES PETERSONvATTORNEY-GENERAL[2015] NZSC 154 [23October 2015]  [2] Mr Peterson applied for a review of the Associate Judge’s decision, an application which, as we understand it, has not yet been determined. He also filed the present application.  [3] The Attorney-General opposes the application, on the basis that the Court does not have jurisdiction to hear appeals against decisions on interlocutory applications in civil matters2 and, in any event, the general requirements for the granting of leave are not met,3 nor is the “exceptional circumstances” criterion for a direct appeal from the High Court to this Court.4  [4] We consider that the Attorney-General’s submissions are correct. If MrPeterson wishes to challenge the decision ofAssociate Judge Christiansen, he must pursue his application for review in the High Court.   [5] Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed. Mr Peterson must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent.

REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Miller J)  [1] Ms Somerville seeks leave to bring a second appeal against her conviction in the District Court on one charge of assault.1  [2] The allegation was that she spat at a young man who she thought had been talking rudely about her with his friend. She admitted following them and confronting them at a mall but denied spitting.  The prosecution called the victim, his friend, and a painter who intervened in the incident. All three said they saw her spit  New Zealand Police v [Somerville] DC Christchurch CRI-2014-009-008726, 11 November 2014.  SOMERVILLE v NEW ZEALAND POLICE [2015] NZCA 499 [22 October 2015]  at the victim. Ms Somerville gave evidence in which she accepted that she had followed the victim and his friend and confronted them.  [3] Dunningham J dismissed an appeal against conviction, holding relevantly that there was ample evidence on which the Judge was entitled to find that the act of spitting had occurred as alleged.2  [4] Ms Somerville says that there has been a miscarriage of justice and that the appeal involves a matter of general or public importance because the public should know that trials are fair and just. She refers to various particulars of the evidence in support of a contention that the witnesses for the prosecution were not credible.  [5] None of these allegations are matters of general or public importance, and we do not accept that they give rise to a miscarriage of justice.3  [6] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  [2015] NZSC 151   BETWEEN  JOHN KENNETH SLAVICH Applicant   AND  THE JUDGES OFTHE SUPREME COURT Respondent    Court: Elias CJ, William Young, Glazebrook, Arnold and O'Regan JJ Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment: 22 October 2015  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall is dismissed.  REASONS  Background  [1] Mr Slavich applies for a recall of this Court’s judgment in Slavich v The Judges of the Supreme Court delivered on 1 September 2015.1  [2] That judgment dismissed an application for review, pursuant to s 28(3) of the Supreme Court Act 2003, of a decision of William Young J, which in turn dismissed an application for review of a decision of the Supreme Court Registrar under s 28(2) of the Supreme Court Act.2  1 Slavich v The Judges of the Supreme Court [2015] NZSC 130 (Elias CJ, William Young, Glazebrook,Arnold and O’Regan JJ).  2 Slavich v The Judges of the Supreme Court [2015]NZSC125.  JOHN KENNETH SLAVICH vTHE JUDGES OF THE SUPREME COURT[2015] NZSC 151 [22 October 2015]  [3] Mr Slavich submits that the Court’s decision dated 1 September 2015 should be recalled because it did not deal with the contention that the High Court decision declaring Mr Slavich a vexatious litigant is, according to Mr Slavich, a legal “nullity”.   Disposition  [4] The submission is not correct. The argument that the High Court judgment declaring Mr Slavich a vexatious litigant under s 88B of the JudicatureAct 1908 is a “nullity” was explicitly acknowledged and rejected in our review decision.3 In any event, it was not relevant to the question of this Court’s jurisdiction to deal with MrSlavich’s application for leave to appeal.4 As William YoungJ correctlystated, and as we confirmed in our review decision, this Court does not have power to grant leave in “contradiction” of s 88B of the JudicatureAct.  [5] To the extent that the application for recall appears to be part of a continuing attempt by Mr Slavich to subvert the High Court order declaring him a vexatious litigant, it is also an abuse of process.   [6] The application for recall is therefore dismissed.   3 Slavich v The Judges of the Supreme Court, above n  1,  at [3]–[4].  4 At [4].  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  [2015 SC 90/2015 ] NZSC 152   BETWEEN  JANINE DAVINA SAX Applicant   AND  LUKE ANDREW SIMPRespondent  SON    Court: William Young, Glazebrook and O'Regan JJ Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment: 22 October 2015  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall is dismissed.  REASONS  Background  [1] Ms Sax applies for the recall of this Court’s judgment in Sax v Simpson.1 That judgment dealt with the Ms Sax’s application for leave to appeal against a judgment of the Court of Appeal 2 In that decision, the Court of Appeal refused to grant an extension of time for Ms Sax to file her case on appeal.  [2] In this Court’s judgment, wesaid that the Court ofAppeal applied settled law when deciding whether an extension should be granted in the particular factual circumstances and that the application raised no question of public or general importance.3 In addition, this Court said there had been nothing put before it by  1 Sax v Simpson [2015] NZSC 144 (WilliamYoung, Glazebrook and O’ReganJJ). 2 Sax v Simpson [2015] NZCA362 (Randerson,White andWinkelmann JJ). 3 Sax v Simpson, above n1, at [11].  JANINE DAVINASAX vLUKE ANDREWSIMPSON[2015] NZSC 152[22October 2015]  Ms Sax that suggested that the Court ofAppeal decision was erroneous or that there was a risk of a miscarriage of justice.4  [3] The majority of Ms Sax’s recall application mirrors her earlier application for leave to appeal. However, it differs in one respect: Ms Sax submits that this Court erred in relying on the factual summary of the Court of Appeal with regard to her communications with that Court’s Registry.     Discussion  [4] To the extent that Ms Sax’s application merely repeats arguments already dealt with, it provides no grounds for a recall. In addition, a recall application is not the proper forum to raise new matters, such as disputing the accuracy of the Court of Appeal’s factual summary.5 In any event, this Court explicitly recognised that the factual background concerning Ms Sax’s communications with the Court of Appeal Registry was “[a]t most … peripherally relevant to [whether there should have been an extension of time] and it would have no bearing on whether her application for leave to appeal to this Court should be granted”.6  Result  [5] The application for recall is therefore dismissed.  4 At [11]. 5 See Siemer v O’Brien [2015]NZSC 89 at [3]; and Creser v Creser [2015] NZSC 116 at [4]. 6 Sax v Simpson, above n1, at n 13.

REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks recall of the Court’s most recent judgment in this matter.1 He argues the Court did not deal with delay or with the fact that the Court ofAppeal did not make a decision.  [2] Both were in fact referred to at [3] of the judgment. Delay in deciding did not add anything to the principal ground of appeal, that the Court of Appeal did not make a decision on the applicant’s application for an extension of time. The Court found that the fact the Court of Appeal Judge did not decide whether to grant an extension of time did not provide a proper basis for appeal in the circumstances explained at [4] of the judgment.

REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Collins J)  [1] The appellant, Steven May, initially faced four charges, namely kidnapping the complainant, indecently assaulting the complainant, sexually violating the complainant and attempting to pervert the course of justice. His trial on these charges commenced in theWhangarei District Court on 12 November 2012.  [2] At the conclusion of the Crown case Judge John McDonald dismissed the kidnappingcharge pursuant to s 347 ofthe Crimes Act 1961. Mr Maythen sought a  MAYv R [2015] NZCA494[21October 2015]  sentence indication on the remaining three charges. Judge McDonald gave a sentence indication oftwo years and nine months’imprisonment. Mr May accepted that sentence indication and pleaded guilty.  [3] On 22 November2012, JudgeMcDonald sentenced Mr Mayto two years and nine months’ imprisonment on the sexual violation charge and one year’s imprisonment on each of the indecent assault and attempting to pervert the course of justice charges.1 All sentences were concurrent.  [4] Mr May’s notice of appeal against conviction and sentence was filed on 17April 2014, some 18 months out of time. He has taken no steps to pursue his appeal or to provide a factual explanation for his delay. He has not applied formally for an extension of time.  The registry has made all reasonable endeavours to contact MrMay at his address for service and at hislast known address. Mr May’s appeal was set down for hearing before us on 19 October 2015. The appeal was called in open Court but Mr Maydid not attend the hearing.  [5] We have reviewed the evidence and the sentencing notes of Judge McDonald.  In our assessment Mr May was right to plead guilty to the three charges remaining at the end of the Crown case. The evidence in support of those charges was convincing. The sentence imposed by Judge McDonald was well within the range available.  [6] We can see no basis upon which we could allow the conviction appeal by vacating Mr May’s pleas or interfere with the sentence.  [7] Mr May’s appeal isdismissed.

As counsel will have explained to you, the reason you are here is because when I sentenced you on the other charges earlier I overlooked that you had pleaded guilty to one charge of possession of pseudoephedrine for supply. I did not sentence you on that charge and it is necessary to do so today.  [2] The sentence I will impose will be the same sentence as was imposed on each of the charges of supplying pseudoephedrine to which you pleaded guilty. That sentence will be served concurrently with your present sentences, which means that you will not serve any additional time in prison.  [3] Mr Zhang, there was one outstanding charge which was a duplicate of a charge on which you were found guilty. I formally grant the Crown leave to withdraw that charge: CRN 13092016876.  [4] Would you please stand Mr Zhang. On the charge of possession of pseudoephedrine for supply to which you pleaded guilty prior to trial you are sentenced to imprisonment for six years and five months, to be served concurrently with the like sentences imposed on the charges of supplying pseudoephedrine to which you also pleaded guilty.  Please stand down.  ……………………………. Toogood J

B The applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent.    REASONS  [1] Mr Rabson and Richard John Creser (the appellants) are the appellants in an appeal to the Court ofAppeal. Mr Rabson applied for an extension oftime forthem to file the case on appeal and apply for a hearing date.1 The application was referred to WildJ for decision.  [2] In a minute dated 4 August 2015,2 the Judge observed that, because the appellants had not provided security for costs, there was no point in considering the application. The appellants had exhausted all avenues to have the requirement to  1 Although Mr Rabson and Mr Creser are appellants on the record. Only Mr Rabson sought the extensionoftime.

MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON vTRANSPARENCYINTERNATIONALNEWZEALAND INCORPORATED [2015] NZSC 145[16 October 2015]  provide security dispensed with.3 Under the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005, they were barred from applying for a fixture until they provided security whether they had an extension of time or not.4  [3] Mr Rabson, but not Mr Creser, seeks leave to appeal against Wild J’s refusal to determine the application for an extension of time. He argues that it was improper for WildJ not to deal with the application. He complains about the delay in the issuing of the minute. He alleges bias because Wild J noted that the failure to provide securitymeant the respondent could seek to have the appeal struck out under r 37(1) of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules.  [4] We do not consider that any of the grounds for the grant of leave in s 13 of the Supreme Court Act 2003 is made out. Wild J’s comments were statements of fact. No fair-minded observer would consider there was any indication of bias. The reality was that Mr Rabson was seeking an extension of time to take a step that was not open to him because the appellants had failed to provide security and had exhausted all available avenues to have that requirement dispensed with. It would have been futile to deal with the application unless and until the security was provided. The situation is fact-specific and no issue of public importance arises.  There is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.  [5] The application is dismissed. Mr Rabson must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  AUCKLAND REGISTRY CIV-2014-404-2946 [2015] NZHC 2522  UNDER Part 18 of the High Court Rules, s 51 Trustee Act 1956  AND IN THE MATTER of the MILOU TRUST, settled by Deed dated 18 December 2003  BETWEEN CHRISTOPHER JAMES HEAPHY AS TRUSTEE OF THE MILOU TRUST Plaintiff  AND CHRISTOPHER JAMES HEAPHY, LEE­ANN FAYE MERCER, JONATHAN CHARLES HEAPHY AS TRUSTEES OF THE MILOU TRUST Defendants  In Chambers: On papers  Judgment: 14 October 2015   JUDGMENT OF THE HON JUSTICE KÓS (Costs)  [1] A matrimonial home is held by a trust. The marriage had dissolved. The trustees were the former husband and wife, together with the brother of the husband. The trust became deadlocked. Everyone agreed that some or all of the trustees needed to be replaced. The former husband therefore applied under s 51 of the Trustee Act 1956 for removal of his former wife as trustee. Alternatively, for removal of all trustees and their replacement with an independent trustee.  [2] A case management conference was held before Associate Judge Sargisson  on 16 April 2015. The Associate Judge’s minute records that parties, through  HEAPHY v HEAPHY [2015] NZHC 2522 [14 October 2015]  counsel, had agreed the current trustees be removed, and that an independent trustee be appointed in their place.  Counsel were to discuss potential appointees.   [3] However, on the next case management conference occasion, 15 May 2015, the Associate Judge recorded that the parties had been unable to reach agreement and the matter would have to be determined by the Court.  [4] The matter was therefore called before me on 7 August 2015. At that point common sense again prevailed. After an adjournment of about an hour in which counsel and the parties held discussions, it was agreed that the existing trustees be removed and that Lewis Grant, an Auckland solicitor, be appointed independent trustee instead pursuant to s 51.   [5] The consent order provided for the Court to determine costs (if not agreed). Disagreement has again broken out.   [6] Lengthy submissions have been filed, advancing charge and counter-charge. But the fact remains that the defended hearing in which these matters could be examined by the Court did not take place. In a situation in which the rights and wrongs of the matter are misty, I am not prepared to determine them on the basis of irreconcilable affidavits and submissions.  [7] Where the Court is in a position to form a clear view as to the merits on a contested s 51 application, a costs order may be appropriate. In any other case, and this is one, it is not. There will therefore be no order for costs by the Court. But the parties are entitled to apply to the new trustee for payment of their reasonable legal costs (as determined by the trustee) from the trust’s estate.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 65/2015 [2015] NZSC 142   BETWEEN  ROBERT GEORGE KEEN Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Court:  William Young, Arnold and O’Regan JJ   Counsel:  A J Bailey forApplicant M J Lillico for Respondent   Judgment:  13 October 2015    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant was found guilty of possessing methamphetamine for supply. When located, the methamphetamine in question was found in a plastic shopping bag that also contained $43,170 in cash under the mobile home in which the applicant lived. In the District Court, forfeiture of this money was ordered on the basis that it was “a float intended to fund future purchases of methamphetamine”.1 This finding of fact justified forfeiture under s 32(3) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 (as it meant that the money was held “for the purpose of facilitating the commission” of offences against that Act). Forfeiture was upheld on appeal to the Court of Appeal.2 The Court of Appeal considered it sufficient that the money was held for the purpose of being available if needed, and to the extent required, for future drug purchases and  1 R v Keen DCChristchurch CRI-2011-042-3369, 6August 2014 (Judge Garland) at [11]. 2 R v Keen [2015] NZCA221 (French, Simon France and Clifford JJ).  ROBERTGEORGE KEEN v R [2015] NZSC 142[13 October 2015]  that it was thus irrelevant that the applicant might or might not have used some of the moneyfor other purposes such as everyday living.3  [2] The District Court Judge seems to have proceeded on the basis that all the money was to be used for future drug purchases. The burden of the applicant’s argument is that the Judge’s approach was wrong on the facts and that the Court of Appeal was only able to uphold the forfeiture by taking a relaxed approach to s 32(3). The complaint is that all the money was forfeited in circumstances where it was probable that only some of it would have been used for future drug purchases.  [3] To succeed on the appeal, the applicant would have to persuade the Court that  (a) the trial Judge’s finding of fact was wrong; and (b) the Court of Appeal’s approach to s 32(3) was incorrect.   [4] The Crown submissions are that there was an adequate evidential foundation for the finding of fact and we would not normally grant leave to allow such a finding to be challenged. As well, what was required was an assessment of the applicant’s purpose in holding the money at the time of seizure rather than an accurate prediction of how the moneywould be used in the future.   [5] Against that background we are of the view that the proposed appeal does not raise any issue of public or general importance and we see no appearance of a miscarriage.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CIV 2015-404-493 [2015] NZHC 2439  BETWEEN  CAMPBELL GRAHAM JOHNSTONE Appellant   AND  JOANNE MARGARET JOHNSTONE Respondent    In chambers: On papers Judgment: 6 October 2015  JUDGMENT OF THE HON JUSTICE KÓS (Costs)  [1] My judgment of 28 August 2015 dismissed this appeal.1 Costs were reserved.   [2] The appellant accepts he must pay costs. There is agreement that the costs should be awarded on a category 2 band B basis, and that $150 for disbursements is appropriate.   [3] There is disagreement on three points. Having considered the submissions, and essentially for reasons given by Mr Gilchrist in his reply submissions, I am satisfied the costs sought by the respondent are appropriate.  Specifically:  (a)  item 53 is applicable, (despite the absence of a cross appeal);   (b)  item 54 is applicable (the post hearing attendances being required by the Court and arising from the prosecution of the appeal); and    Johnstone v Johnstone [2015] NZHC 2047.  JOHNSTONE v JOHNSTONE [2015] NZHC 2439 [6 October 2015]  (c) the augmented daily rate of $2,250 applies as from 1 July 2015 in accordance with the High Court Amendment Rules 2015 (SR 2015/102).  Result  [4] Accordingly there will be costs in favour of the respondent in the sum of $11,010 together with disbursements of $150.

         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY    CRI 2015-485-46  [2015] NZHC 2435       BETWEEN     KAYLA-LEIGH BRABENDER  Appellant      AND     MINISTRY OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT  Respondent       Hearing:     6 October 2015      Counsel:     P Ross for Appellant  S C Carter and R Georgiou for Respondent      Judgment:     6 October 2015         JUDGMENT OF SIMON FRANCE J  (Appeal against sentence/reparation)    [1] Ms Brabender was sentenced having pleaded guilty to charges of obtaining by deception (x2) and using a document (x3).  The context was falsely obtaining a benefit by reason of not declaring a relationship.   [2] Ms Brabender was sentenced to home detention for five months, 150 hours’ community work and $45,721.58 reparation by way of $20.50 per week instalments.  The reparation amount was believed by the Court to have been agreed prior to sentencing and was imposed without further consideration.1  It is that part of the sentence that is now appealed.   [3] On appeal Mr Ross explained that the reparation total was not agreed, and he had submitted a lesser sum was appropriate, based on the amount able to be paid and the length of time for which such an order should ensue.    1  Ministry of Social Development v Brabender [2015] NZDC 13481.  [4] Mr Georgiou accepted that the current order, which would last for 43 years, was not supportable on the authorities.  He acknowledged a length of around five years was generally imposed but noted that in R v Vallily, eight years had been accepted.2   [5] As noted, the reparation commitment as it presently stands will continue for 43 years.  Previous authority has indicated such orders are not desirable.  The length is unrealistic and bond the offender for an inordinate period of time.3  An order lasting for between three to five years is commonly substituted.  R v Vallily was somewhat different as the offender was expected to have means, and had agreed to repay at the rate of $5,000 per year.  Even then, the Court limited reparation from the initial order of $87,000 to one of $40,000.   [6] It is important when reaching agreement and/or making submissions, that an informant has proper regard to these previous authorities.  The appeal is allowed.  The reparation order is quashed and in its place there will be an order for reparation of $4,570 to be repaid at a rate of $20.00 per week.    2  R v Vallily CA251/04, 10 November 2004.  3  R v Bailey CA306/03, 10 May 2004; Leighton v Police [2012] NZHC 1925.      ___________________________  Simon France J    Solicitors:   Public Defence Service, Wellington  Luke Cunningham & Clere, Crown Solicitors, Wellington  
NOTE: PUBLICATION OFNAME OR IDENTIFYING PARTICULARS OF COMPLAINANTPROHIBITED BY S 139 OFTHE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 1985.  IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  CA369/2015 [2015] NZCA 466   BETWEEN PAULANTONY MCMASTER Appellant  AND THE QUEEN Respondent   Court: Harrison, Dobson and Gilbert JJ  Counsel: R M Mansfield forAppellant J E LCarruthers for Respondent  Judgment: 29 September 2015 at 11.45 am (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  A Theapplicationforan extension to timeto appeal is granted.  B The appeal isallowed. The sentence of13 years’imprisonment is quashed.  A sentence of 12 years and one month’s imprisonment is substituted.    REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given by Dobson J)  [1] We have considered the joint memorandum of counsel dated 24 August 2015 and aresatisfied that the present application can be dealt with on the papers.   MCMASTER v R [2015] NZCA466[29 September 2015]  [2] The application is for a reduction in Mr McMaster’s sentence following a partially successful appeal against conviction. Mr McMaster is out of time for any appeal against sentence and accordingly an extension is required.   [3] In November 2012, Mr McMaster and three co-accused were sentenced on convictionsforsexual violation byrape.  Theyhad each been convicted of onecount as a principal, and three counts as a party to rape.   [4] Appeals by Mr McMaster and three co-accused were partially successful to the extent that their convictions for being a party to three counts of sexual violation by rape were quashed.1  [5] Following the appeals against conviction, those three co-accused have all pursued successful sentence appeals. In the case of Dylan John O’Neill and Corey Clinton Owens, this Court substituted sentences of 12 years and nine months’ imprisonment with sentences of 11 years and 10 months in each case.2 A third co-accused, Samuel Owen Weenink, then made separate application and, adopting the reasoning in its earlier decision, this Court similarly reduced MrWeenink’s sentence from 12 years and nine months to 11 years and 10 months’ imprisonment.3  [6] MrMcMaster’s culpabilitywas treatedbythe sentencingJudgeas marginally greater than the others, resulting in an end sentence that was three months longer than the others. The Crown accepts that parity requires Mr McMaster’s sentence to be reduced by the same extent as that determined by this Court for the co-accused.  We agree.   [7] Accordingly, the application for an extension of time to appeal is granted, and the appeal is allowed. The sentence of 13 years’ imprisonment is quashed. A sentence of 12 years and one month’s imprisonment is substituted. The reduction of 11 months achieves parityof treatment with the co-accused.

REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by French J)  [1] In an “on the papers” judgment delivered on 19 August 2015 this Court declined Mr France’s application for leave to bring a second appeal.1  [2] Mr France has now applied for a recall of that judgment on the grounds he objected to the matter being dealt with on the papers, the Court misunderstood the proposed grounds of appeal and the judgment is invalid because the copyhe received was unsigned.  France v New Zealand Police [2015] NZCA381.  FRANCE v NEWZEALAND POLICE [2015] NZCA458[24 September 2015]  [3] The application for recall is dismissed. By virtue of s 329 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, the Court was entitled to deal with the matter on the papers without Mr France’s consent.  We do not accept the Court has misstated the proposed grounds of appeal and the fact a copy was unsigned is plainly not grounds for recall.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellington for Respondent 
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA183/2015 [2015] NZCA 454  BETWEEN  QUEENSLAND MAINTENANCE SERVICES (NZ) LIMITED Appellant   AND  QUEENSLAND MAINTENANCE SERVICES (PTY) LIMITED (IN LIQUIDATION) Respondent   Counsel:  M Heard forAppellant AW Johnson for Respondent   Judgment:  22 September 2015 at 2 pm    (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF COOPER J  The respondent is entitled to costs in the sum of $995 consequent on the withdrawal of the appeal.   REASONS  [1] This appeal, filed on 13April 2015 was abandoned on 21July 2015.  Security for costs had been paid, in the sum of $5,880.  [2] The respondent now seeks costs. Its solicitor, Mr Johnson accepts that the matters in issue were not complex and the appeal should be treated as a standard appeal.  He then notes that the respondent and/or its lawyers have:  (a) drafted and filed a notice in support of the appeal on othergrounds;  QUEENSLAND MAINTENANCE SERVICES (NZ)LTD V QUEENSLAND MAINTENANCE SERVICES (PTY) LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) [2015] NZCA454[22September 2015]  (b)  at the appellant’s request reviewed the draft index of the case on appeal;   (c)  received and reviewed the final version of the case on appeal; and   (d)  been engaged in ongoing communications with the Court as to the setting down of the appeal, the hearing date and pre-appeal directions.    [3] Counsel for the appellant notes that the steps for which costs are sought are not referred to in Schedule 2 to the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005. Mr Heard submits that although r 53D(1)(b) contemplates costs for steps not so included, counsel for the respondent has adopted a “granular analysis”, claiming for minor attendances of an insignificant nature. Mr Heard also submits that the respondent should have provided details of the actual costs incurred.  [4] It is not disputed that the respondent has taken the steps referred to and in doing so has incurred some costs. In my assessment, it would be appropriate to make an allowance reflecting half a day in respect of the attendances to which the respondent has referred. Calculated as for a standard appeal that results in an award of $995.  [5] The respondent is entitled to costs in the sum of $995 consequent on the withdrawal of the appeal.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND SC 63/2015 [2015] NZSC 137  BETWEEN  SIONE FEHOKO MAKANESI   Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN   Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, William Young and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person   J E L Carruthers for Respondent   Judgment:  21 September 2015    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant, Mr Makanesi, was found guilty of supplying methamphetamine, possessing methamphetamine for supply and supplying a precursor substance at a jury trial in the Auckland District Court and was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment, with a minimum period of imprisonment of five years, six months.1 Although he filed an appeal against both conviction and sentence, Mr Makanesi abandoned his conviction appeal through counsel and proceeded only with the appeal against sentence.  That appeal was unsuccessful.2 Mr Makanesi now seeks leave to appeal to this Court against his convictions and his sentence.  [2] In relation to his proposed conviction appeal, Mr Makanesi indicated in his application for leave to appeal that he wished to raise the issue of the competence of his appellate counsel. However, he has subsequently indicated that he wishes to  1 R v Makanesi DC Auckland CRI-2011-004-19490, 5 December 2013. 2 Makanesi v R [2015] NZCA 134.  SIONE FEHOKO MAKANESI v R [2015] NZSC 137 [21 September 2015]  raise additional issues, including severance, competence of trial counsel, admissibility of evidence led by the Crown, fresh evidence and the conduct of the jury. Mr Makanesi has not provided any detail or background to these grounds.  [3] In the Court of Appeal, counsel for Mr Makanesi filed a memorandum dated 10 November 2014 advising that he had become involved as counsel after the notice of appeal was filed and that he had considered the file and discussed the position with Mr Makanesi. However, he did not at that point have clear instructions. Subsequently, on 17 March 2015, counsel filed a further memorandum advising that he now had clear instructions from Mr Makanesi, which were that he wished to abandon his conviction appeal and proceed only with the sentence appeal. This is what then happened.  [4] Because Mr Makanesi abandoned his conviction appeal, none of the matters which he wishes to raise on appeal to this Court has been addressed by the Court of Appeal. If Mr Makanesi wishes to pursue an appeal against his convictions, the appropriate course is that he applies to the Court of Appeal for leave to withdraw his notice of abandonment and reinstate his appeal. We understand that Mr Makanesi made such an application on 27 August 2015.  [5] In relation to the sentence appeal, it raises no point of principle, nor does there appear to be any risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.  [6] For these reasons, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  Solicitors: Crown Law Office, Wellington for Respondent  
IN THE EMPLOYMENT COURT WELLINGTON [2015] NZEmpC 162 EMPC 175/2014  IN THE MATTER OF  an application for costs   BETWEEN  ALAN ROBINSON   Plaintiff    AND PACIFIC SEALS NEW ZEALAND LTD Defendant Hearing: On the papers filed on 5, 12 and 19 August 2015 Appearances: T Kennedy, counsel for the plaintiff J Tannahill, counsel for the defendant Judgment: 18 September 2015  COSTS JUDGMENT OF JUDGE CHRISTINA INGLIS  [1] The defendant applies for costs in relation to the plaintiff’s unsuccessful challenge,1 his unsuccessful application for a rehearing2 and attendance at a Judicial Settlement Conference. The plaintiff submits that there should be no award of costs.  The parties were encouraged to agree costs but have been unable to do so.       [2] The Court has a broad discretion as to costs. 3 While broad, the discretion is to be exercised judicially and in accordance with principles.  The primary principle is that costs follow the event. 4 The usual starting point in ordinary cases is two-thirds of actual and reasonable costs. From that starting point factors that justify either an increase or a decrease are assessed.  1 Robinson v Pacific Seals New Zealand Ltd [2014] NZEmpC 99. 2 Robinson v Pacific Seals New Zealand Ltd [2015] NZEmpC 84. 3 Employment Relations Act 2000, Sch 3, cl 19. 4 Victoria University of Wellington v Alton-Lee [2001] ERNZ 305 (CA) at [48].  ALAN ROBINSON v PACIFIC SEALS NEW ZEALAND LTD NZEmpC WELLINGTON [2015] NZEmpC 162 [18 September 2015]  [3] The application for costs stumbles at the first hurdle.  That is because there is nothing before the Court to indicate whether the defendant has actually incurred any costs in defending the challenge or the application for rehearing,5 despite this omission being squarely pointed out by Ms Kennedy, counsel for the plaintiff, in a memorandum on costs 6 and despite a reply to that memorandum being filed on behalf of the defendant.   [4] I am not satisfied that it is appropriate to make any order as to costs in the circumstances. I am unable to determine whether the defendant has incurred any costs and, if so, what any such costs have been.  That, in turn, makes it impossible to assess what a reasonable contribution to costs might be.  [5] The defendant’s application for costs is accordingly dismissed.  Christina Inglis Judge  Judgment signed at 11.30 am on 18 September 2015  5 It is not the practice of the Court to order costs in relation to the voluntary attendance of parties at a Judicial Settlement Conference and no authority or basis for departing from such an approach was identified. 6 Referring to the general approach to costs in this Court and citing Eastern Bay Independent Industrial Workers Union Inc v Pedersen Industries Ltd AC11A/09 27 April 2009 in support of her  submission that no costs ought to be ordered inthe defendant’s favour. 
         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  PALMERSTON NORTH REGISTRY    CIV 2015-454-61  [2015] NZHC 2200       BETWEEN     THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE  Applicant      AND     ROBERT WILLIAM DIXON  Respondent      AND     LAUREN BRIDGETTE LANFEAR  First Interested Party       Hearing:     10 September 2015      Counsel:     E M Fitzherbert for Applicant  No Appearance by Respondent      Judgment:     11 September 2015         JUDGMENT OF BROWN J    [1] When this matter was called on 21 July 2015 the respondent Mr Dixon appeared and sought further time to enable him to instruct counsel.  The matter was adjourned to today and Ms FitzHerbert informs me that Justice MacKenzie indicated to Mr Dixon that it would be necessary for him to be prepared to proceed today.   [2] There is no appearance today by Mr Dixon or by counsel instructed by him.  Ms FitzHerbert has received no further communication from Mr Dixon nor has there been any communication by Mr Dixon to the Court.  In those circumstances Ms FitzHerbert requests that the Court make the orders sought in the application dated 28 May 2015.    [3] The application is supported by an affidavit of Detective Senior Sergeant B A Murray who is the manager of the Central and Southern Asset Recovery Unit in the New Zealand Police and an affidavit of Mr G R Beattie, a financial investigator attached to the Central Asset Recovery Unit.   [4] In short it is apparent from their evidence that Mr Dixon was involved in a “muling” operation involving the smuggling of cash.  In a video interview with the Police Mr Dixon admitted that he received money from a person he refused to name and that he was to take the money for a “run” to Wellington.  A copy of the transcript of the video interview was annexed to the affidavit of Mr Beattie.   [5] Detective Sergeant Murray expresses the view on the basis of the evidence that Mr Dixon was clearly acting as a cash smuggling “mule” for an unknown drug syndicate.   [6] On the basis of the evidence adduced it is my view that the property specified in the application, namely cash to the value of $49,900, is tainted property and that Mr Dixon has unlawfully benefited from significant criminal activity.  Accordingly the grounds are established for the orders sought in the application dated 28 May 2015.   [7] An order is made in terms of the draft order lodged by the applicant.      _______________________  Brown J    Solicitors:   Ben Vanderkolk & Associates, Crown Solicitors, Palmerston North

I have also received a memorandum from counsel for the Melva Mahon Inheritance Trust.     [2] Costs of the executors, and the Melva Mahon Inheritance Trust, have already been dealt with, by the judgment of Associate Judge Christiansen dated 25 June 2014.1  The Trust’s position is dealt with in [90].  The position of the executors is dealt with in the last sentence of [92], and [94].  Any dispute over the extent of the executors’ claim for indemnity costs, as provided for in [94], should be referred to Judge Christiansen, having regard to my retirement.   [3] As between the plaintiffs and John Mahon in his personal capacity, I consider that there is no reason to depart from the primary general principle that costs follow the event.  Category 2B is appropriate.  There was a settlement offer shortly before trial.  That does not justify an award of increased costs.   [4] There will be an order for costs against the plaintiffs in favour of John Mahon on a 2B basis, with disbursements, to be fixed by the Registrar.    1  Mahon v Mahon [2014] NZHC 1430.            _________________________  A D MacKenzie J    Solicitors:  Raymond S Walker, Barristers & Solicitors, Auckland, for plaintiffs    Bell Booth Sherry, Takapuna,     Harkness Henry, Hamilton, for first defendants    Nielsen Law, Hamilton for second defendants

[Foundation Life (NZ) Limited] is dealing with matters in relation to [its] business in respect of which it would be helpful for them to understand in more detail the Demutualisation (and we understand the relevant documents would have been filed with the Court)[.]  [3] It is also said that as Tower Corporation was the only party to the proceedings it is unlikely that any other person will be adversely affected by this application.    [4] The file to which access is sought was transferred to Archives New Zealand sometime in 2003.  It has a “restricted access” classification.2  Archives New Zealand has provided the file to this Court to determine whether access may be granted.   [5] The difficulties for the Court are the very general nature of the request and the large size of the file to which access is sought.3  It will take some time for the Court to review the file to determine whether there are confidentiality or other reasons why access should not be granted in whole or in part.  That Tower was the only party to the proceeding does not necessarily make it unlikely that any other person will be adversely affected.  It is not clear what other avenues Foundation Life (NZ) Limited may have for obtaining the information it seeks and what steps it has taken to do so.   [6] If Foundation Life (NZ) Limited wishes to pursue its application, it should provide further information setting out in more detail the reason for its request and what other avenues it has explored for obtaining the information.  It should also make inquiries to determine whether the Court file is likely to have information that, if disclosed, will adversely affect any other person.  I note, for example, that the Court received a report from KPMG as an independent expert.  The Court also received submissions from Peter Jenkin QC as amicus curiae.  It may be that these parties could assist Foundation Life (NZ) Limited with that issue.   [7] In the meantime the application for general access to the file is declined.  The matter can be revisited if Foundation Life (NZ) Limited provides the further information sought.    2  Public Records Act 2005, s 43.  3  See for example Schenker AG v Commerce Commission [2013] NZCA 114, (2013) 22 PRNZ 286.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  [2015] NZSC 130   BETWEEN  JOHN KENNETH SLAVICH Applicant   AND  THE JUDGES OFTHE SUPREME COURT Respondent    Court: Elias CJ, William Young, Glazebrook, Arnold and O'Regan JJ Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment: 1 September 2015  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for review is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] Mr Slavich applies for a review, under s 28(3) of the Supreme Court Act 2003, ofWilliam Young J’s judgment of 11 August 2015.1  [2] In that judgment WilliamYoungJupheld the Registrar’s decision to refuseto accept for filing an application for leave to appeal against a decision of 3 July 2015 ofVenning J.2  [3] Mr Slavich submits that William YoungJ’s decision was erroneous becauseit did not deal with the correct ground of recusal or with the grounds for reviewing the Registrar’s decision relatingto s8(c)ofthe Supreme Court Act. It also did not take  1 Slavich v The Judges of the Supreme Court [2015]NZSC125. 2 Slavich v Justice O’Regan [2015] NZHC 1558.  JOHN KENNETH SLAVICH vTHE JUDGES OF THE SUPREME COURT[2015] NZSC 130 [1 September 2015]  into account the alleged fact that the High Court decision declaring Mr Slavich a vexatious litigant3 should be treated as a nullity bythis Court.  [4] Thequestion dealtwith in William YoungJ’s decision was whether this Court has jurisdiction to deal with Mr Slavich’s application. None of the matters raised in the application for review by Mr Slavich are relevant to that point.  [5] We agree with William Young J, for the reasons he gives, that there was no jurisdiction.4  [6] The application for review is accordingly dismissed.5  3 See Attorney-General v Slavich [2013] NZHC 627. This is on the basis this Court “has yet to determine the matters upon whichthe [Applicant] wasfound to be avexatiouslitigant”.  4 See Slavich v The Judges of the Supreme Court,  above n  1,  at [8].  5 We have assumed that there is jurisdiction to review William Young J’s decision under s 28(3); see Howard v Accident Compensation Corporation [2014]NZSC 31, (2014) 21 PRNZ 815 at [3] and Rabson v Chapman [2014] NZSC 90 at n3, where the Court assumed, without deciding, that s28(3)appliestoanapplicationfor leave toappeal. WilliamYoungJispart ofthe Courtforthe reasons set out in Howard v Accident Compensation Corporation at [3] and Siemer v Stiassny [2014] NZSC 80 at [4] and [6]. The other Judges are party to this decision because they are permanent judges of this Court and there are not sufficient acting judges available to deal with the matter, even if it were appropriate to have a matter such as this dealt with solely by acting judges ofthis Court.  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND PALMERSTON NORTH REGISTRY CIV 2015-454-92 [2015] NZHC 2071  IN THE MATTER of the Trustee Act 1956  AND  IN THE MATTER of an application by the estate of James Thomas Kett for a vesting order pursuant to s 52 of the Act  Hearing: On Papers Counsel: R Kennedy for Plaintiff Judgment: 28 August 2015  JUDGMENT OF BROWN J  [1] This is an application for a vesting order under s 52 of the Trustee Act 1956. In a memorandum dated 27 August 2015 Mr Kennedy requested that urgency be given to consideration of the application because there is an unconditional agreement dated 19 August 2015 for the sale of the property, the subject of the application, which is due for settlement on 4 September 2015.  [2] An application has been filed for permission to commence the proceeding by originating application upon the grounds that there is no defendant in the proceeding, the proceeding involves a matter of urgency and it is in the interests of justice to permit the proceeding to be commenced by originating application. I grant permission under HCR 19.5 for the proceeding to be brought by originating application.  ESTATE OF JAMES THOMAS KETT [2015] NZHC 2071 [28 August 2015]  [3] The property at 3 Jubilee Court, Palmerston North (“the property”) is owned as to one half share by Desiree Mary Kett and as to the other half share by the trustees of the James Thomas Kett Estate, namely Desiree Mary Kett, David Jonathan Kett and James Kett. The property is the subject of an agreement for sale and purchase which as earlier noted has a date of settlement of 4 September 2015.  [4] Unfortunately Desiree Mary Kett is incapable of executing the necessary documentation in connection with the sale of the property. Her present mental incapacity is evidenced by a statement from her doctor dated 27 August 2015 annexed to the affidavit of David Jonathan Kett.  [5] Although Desiree Kett executed an enduring power of attorney on 9 April 2015, the power of attorney relates only to her personal property affairs and does not extend to her role as trustee. Consequently, in order to effect the transfer of the property an order is sought vesting in David Jonathan Kett and James Kett the one half share of the property presently registered in the names of all three trustees of the James Thomas Kett Estate.  [6] Having considered the originating application dated 27 August 2015 and the affidavit of David Jonathan Kett also dated 27 August 2015 and the annexures thereto, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make an order under s 52 of the Trustee Act 1956.  [7] Accordingly an order is made in terms of the draft vesting order submitted by counsel.  Brown J  Solicitors: Cooper Rapley Lawyers, Palmerston North  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2015-485-405 [2015] NZHC 2063  UNDER the Trustee Act 1956  BETWEEN THE NEW ZEALAND MAORI COUNCIL First Applicant  SIR EDWARD TAIHAKUREI DURIE Second Applicant  AND FEDERATION OF MAORI AUTHORITIES INCORPORATED Respondent  In Chambers: On papers  Judgment: 28 August 2015   JUDGMENT OF THE HON JUSTICE KÓS (Costs)  [1] In my judgment of 25 August 2015 I reappointed Sir Edward Durie a Maori trustee of the Crown Forestry Rental Trust for a further three-year term.1  [2] The appointment should have been made by the first applicant and the respondent together, as Maori Appointor under the trust deed. As I noted, that body has been unable to reach agreement on any recent trustee appointments.  The result is that this Court for all practical purposes is now the Maori Appointor. As I also said, that result is regrettable.2  [3] I reserved costs.  But I indicated I considered costs should lie where they fall.  1 The New Zealand Maori Council v Federation of Maori Authorities Inc [2015] NZHC 2019. 2 At [1].  THE NEWZEALAND MAORI COUNCILvFEDERATIONOF MAORI AUTHORITIES INCORPORATED  [2015] NZHC 2063 [28 August 2015]  [4] Perhaps commendably, perhaps not, the two constituent members now agree on one thing.  My indication is wrong.  Costs should be awarded.  [5] I accept that the application was competently and efficiently handled and that the hearing was brief. But I decline to award costs.  [6] First, the funds of the trust have been burdened beyond reason already with litigation expenses, to the disadvantage of the proper beneficiaries of the trust and their needs. Secondly, I have given warning previously that further litigation costs may not be awarded by this Court.  Thirdly, and most importantly, my previous costs judgment of 16 March 2015 makes clear that requests for reimbursement of Maori Appointor costs should be directed in the first instance to the trustees. 3 Happily, trusteeship is a function this Court has not assumed.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA142/2015 [2015] NZCA 381  BETWEEN  MALCOLM DANIEL FRANCE Applicant   AND  NEW ZEALAND POLICE Respondent   Court:  White, French and Cooper JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person J E Mildenhall for Respondent    Judgment: 19 August 2015 at 10.30 am (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The extension of time in which to bring the application is granted. B The application for leave to bring a second appeal is declined.    REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by French J)  [1] Mr France seeks leave under ss 237 and 253 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 to bring a second appeal against his conviction and sentence. Mr France was convicted of assault in a Judge alone trial before Judge Dawson in the Auckland  FRANCE v NEW ZEALAND POLICE CA142/2015 [2015] NZCA 381 [19 August 2015]  District Court and sentenced to 80 hours of community work.1 His first appeal to the High Court was dismissed by Thomas J.2  [2] The application for leave was directed to be heard on the papers.3  [3] The grounds of the proposed appeal are that the courts have no jurisdiction over Mr France because he is not a legal person and that the District Court Judge was biased.  [4] The appeal was filed six days out of time. This delay was minimal and the Crown does not oppose an extension of time. Accordingly, we grant the extension of time in which to bring the application.  [5] However, we are satisfied the proposed appeal has no merit and does not raise any issues of general or public importance. There is no evidential foundation for the allegations of bias.  [6] The application for leave to bring a second appeal is accordingly declined.

REASONS  [1] The applicants apply for the recall of this Court’s judgment in Siemer v Brown.1 That judgment dealt with the applicants’ application for leave to appeal against the judgment of Wild J in the Court of Appeal.2 In that decision, WildJ upheld a decision of the Registrar of that Court to refuse to accept for filing an application for review by a panel of three Judges of a decision made by Wild J upholding a decision of the Registrar to refuse to dispense with security for costs in relation to an appeal to the Court of Appeal.3  1 Siemer v Brown [2015] NZSC 102. 2 Siemer v Brown [2015] NZCA161 (WildJ). 3 Siemer v Brown [2015] NZCA69 (WildJ).  VINCENTROSS SIEMER AND JANE DINSDALE SIEMER vKEVIN STANLEYBROWN &ORS [2015] NZSC 126[13August 2015]  [2] In this Court’s judgment, it noted the clear authority arising from a decision of this Court involving the first-named applicant that there is no such right of review.4 Wild J simply applied that authority. This Court also noted that the applicants’attempt to file an application for review by three Court ofAppeal Judges was an abuse ofthat Court’s process. Theattemptto file an application for reviewof the Registrar’s decision to refuse to accept for filing the purported application for review by three Judges aggravated that abuse of process.  [3] The application for recall of this Court’s judgment raises no matter of relevance, let alone any new matter requiring consideration. It, too, is an abuse of process.   [4] The application forrecallis therefore dismissed.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondents.  Siemer v Stiassny [2013] NZSC 11.  
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA430/2015 [2015] NZCA 369  BETWEEN JIU MEIZHENG Applicant  AND THE QUEEN Respondent   Telephone 7 August 2015 Conference:  Counsel: G C Gotlieb forApplicant M J Lillico for Respondent  Judgment: 12 August 2015at 3.00 pm (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF FRENCH J  The application for bail pending appeal is declined.  REASONS  [1] Ms Zheng has applied for bail pending the determination of an appeal against conviction and sentence. She was convicted in the High Court of drug dealing offences involving pseudoephedrine1 and sentenced on 24 July2015 byGilbert J to a term of imprisonment of two years and nine months.2  [2] The primary grounds of the bail application are that permanent arrangements have yet to be made for the care of her dependent children; the prospects of success  1 Ms Zheng was found guilty following jury trial of five charges of supplying pseudoephedrine and one charge of possessionofpseudoephedrine for the purpose of supply.  2 Lam v R [2015] NZHC1713.  ZhengvR (CA430/2015) [2015] NZCA369[12August 2015]  on appeal are “verystrong”; Ms Zheng, who does not speak English, mayexperience difficulties having her medical and dietary needs met in prison; and if her appeal is not granted a hearing date swiftly, she will be eligible for parole in 11 months, meaning the appeal could be rendered nugatory.  [3] At the time the bail application was filed, the appeal did not have a hearing date and it was assumed to be some considerable time away.  However, the Court has been able to provide an early hearing date of 2 September 2015. In my view, in those circumstances, the concerns raised by her counsel lose much of their force. Further, while I am obviously not in a position to attempt any extensive analysis of the merits of the appeal, on the limited information before me I would not necessarily endorse Mr Gotlieb’s assessment of them as falling in the “very strong” category so as to justifybail.  [4] Havingregard to s 14 ofthe BailAct 2000, Ms Zhenghas failed to satisfyme that hers is a case where on the balance of probabilities, it is in the interests of justice to grant her bail pending appeal.  [5] The application for bail is accordingly declined.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent

MUSUKU v THE COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE [2015] NZHC 1889 [12 August 2015]  [l] By my decision dated 26 June 2015 I dismissed the appellant's appeal and awarded costs to the respondent, indicating my view that costs should be on a 2B basis.  [2] The appellant was directed to file a memorandum within 21 days of the date of the decision if the appellant sought to be heard on the issue of costs.  [3] The appellant has not filed a memorandum and the respondent now seeks costs on a 2B basis together with expenses.  [4] Costs are awarded to the respondent on a 2B basis as set out in its memorandum dated 29 July 2015. I am satisfied that the disbursements sought by the respondent should in the circumstances be awarded.   Thomas J  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  CHRISTCHURCH REGISTRY CIV-2013-409-989 [2015] NZHC 1870  BETWEEN THERESE ANNE SISSON Plaintiff  AND IAG NEW ZEALAND LIMITED Defendant  In Chambers: On papers  Judgment: 10 August 2015   JUDGMENT OF THE HON JUSTICE KÓS  [1] Ms Sisson owned a house at 854 Colombo Street, Christchurch. It was demolished following the February 2011 earthquake. Ms Sisson lodged two claims against IAG relating to damage suffered in the September 2010 and February 2011 earthquakes. EQC and IAG later paid Ms Sisson $840,000 (including GST) together with additional fees and costs of $98,264.   [2] These proceedings were filed in May 2013. A further $498,000 was claimed. In March 2014 Associate Judge Osborne resolved some contested interlocutory applications. He ordered further and better particulars and discovery, and security for costs, against Ms Sisson.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA361/2010 [2015] NZCA 358  BETWEEN  S (CA361/2010) Appellant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Court:  White, Keane and Wylie JJ   Counsel:  Appellant in person M D Downs for Respondent   Judgment:  7 August 2015 at 3.00 pm    (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall of the judgment in S (CA361/2010) v R [2013] NZCA 179 delivered on 30 May 2013 is declined.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given byWhite J)  [1] On 30 July 2015 the appellant, Mr S, filed his third application for recall of the Court’s judgment in S (CA361/2010) v R dismissing his appeal against convictions delivered on 30 May 2013.1  [2] Mr S acknowledges in his third application at [6], that it raises nothing new.  Instead his complaint is that matters raised in his submissions have not been dealt  S (CA361/2010) v R [2013] NZCA179 [convictionappeal judgment].  S (CA361/2010) v R [2015] NZCA358[7August 2015]  with or addressed in any way by the Court in its previous judgments declining his applications for recall of the original appeal judgment.2  [3] The background to Mr S’s trial, convictions, appeal and subsequent applications to recall the conviction appeal judgment is set out in the second recall judgment, together with the relevant legal principles relating to the recall of judgments.3 It is therefore unnecessary to repeat the background or the principles.  [4] All of the matters now raised again by Mr S were addressed in the conviction appeal judgment and the first and second recall judgments.4 As Mr S correctly recognises, his third recall application raises nothing new.  [5] Mr S has not sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court against this Court’s 2013 conviction appeal judgment.5 Instead he is seeking to relitigate matters that have already been comprehensively settled in this Court. His third recall application is an abuse of process.6  [6] Accordingly, there is no basis for the third application for recall of the conviction appeal judgment delivered on 30 May2013 and it is declined.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA568/2014 [2015] NZCA 354  BETWEEN  PETER VERSCHAFFELT Appellant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Court:  Harrison, Fogarty and Dobson JJ   Counsel:  S D Cassidy forAppellant J Pike QC for Respondent   Judgment:  5 August 2015 at 11.30 am    (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall of the judgment in [2015] NZCA 53 issued on 10 March 2015 is declined.   REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Dobson J)  [1] On 17 July2015, counsel forMrVerschaffeltfiled an application to recall1 the Court’s judgment issued on 10 March 2015.2 Subsequently, a notice of opposition to the application and submissions on behalf of the respondent were received, dated 23 July 2015.   [2] MrVerschaffelt’s application contends that wemisapprehended his criticism of the way in which the Crown case was presented at trial. His concern is that we  1 See R v Smith [2003]3 NZLR 617(CA) at [36]. 2 Verschaffelt v R [2015] NZCA53.  VERSCHAFFELTV RCA568/2014[2015] NZCA354 [5August 2015]  focused on the prospect of prejudice arising from a change in that the Crown opening was on the basis that MrVerschaffelt was liable as a principal, whereas the Crown closed on the basis that MrVerschaffelt was a party to the manufacture of methamphetamine at his residential address. However, the concern was rather that a shift had occurred from an allegation that MrVerschaffelt was either a principal in the manufacture together with his co-defendant, Mr Atkinson, or a party to the manufacture by MrAtkinson, to an allegation that both Messrs Verschaffelt and Atkinson might be found liable as parties to manufacture by third persons who were not before the Court.   [3] However, MrCassidy’s submissions in support ofthe appeal acknowledged that the Crown opened on the basis that the two accused were either involved in the manufacture of methamphetamine at the address themselves, or allowed and facilitated others to use the address for that purpose. There can be no suggestion that MrVerschaffelt’s defence was taken bysurprise when the Crown case was closed, consistently with that indication in opening.   [4] Nor is there any merit in Mr Cassidy’s complaint that a lack of clarity as to the basis or bases for the Crown’s case led him into error in assessing the admissibilityoftext messages between theco-defendants and others. Thatpoint was considered and rejected in our judgment.3  [5] Accordingly, the application for recall of the judgment in [2015] NZCA 53 issued on 10 March 2015 is declined.

REASONS  [1] Mr Rabson applies for recall of this Court’s decision in Rabson v Transparency International New Zealand.1 In that decision, this Court declined an application for leave to appeal against a decision of Randerson J upholding the decision of the Deputy Registrar of the Court of Appeal refusing to dispense with security for costs.2  [2] Mr Rabson submits that this Court in its decision did not address his proposed ground of appeal which was that Randerson J erred when he said that this Court’s decision in Reekie v Attorney-General3 required the Deputy Registrar to  1 Rabson v Transparency International New Zealand [2015] NZSC 111. 2 Rabson v Transparency International New Zealand Inc [2015] NZCA188. 3 Reekie v Attorney-General [2014] NZSC 63, [2014]1 NZLR 737.

It noted that the Court ofAppeal (Civil) Rules 2005 give the dispensingpower to the Registrar.4 The Court recognised that the Registrar will not always be well placed to perform this task, given that the test for dispensation can include an assessment of merit.5 The Court commented, however, that the Registrar “will simply have to do the best that he or she can”.6 The Court recommended that the Rules Committee reconsider the rules.7 In the meantime, however, the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules must be complied with. In any event, Randerson J himself reviewed the prospects of success of the appeal, which he described as “low”.8 Randerson J’s approach was therefore correct.  [4] The application for recall is dismissed.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA54/2015 [2015] NZCA 345  BETWEEN  THE TRUSTEES OFTHE TAUWHAO TE NGARE TRUST Appellant   AND  DONALD SHAW Respondent   Court:  Stevens, Miller and Winkelmann JJ   Counsel:  J B Orpin forAppellant Respondent (in person)   Judgment:  31 July 2015 at 2.00 pm    (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for an extension of time is granted. The appellants will have an extension until 20 August 2015 to file the case on appeal and apply for a hearing date.  B There is no order as to costs.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given byMiller J)  [1] Theappellants move under r 43 of the Court ofAppeal (Civil) Rules 2005 for an extension of time to file a case on appeal and seek a hearing date. Their application was made two weeks after the expiration of the three month period in  THE TRUSTEES OF THE TAUWHAO TE NGARE TRUSTvSHAWCA54/2015 [2015] NZCA345[31 July 2015]  which to do so. The error was attributable to an oversight on the part of their solicitor.  [2] The respondent, Mr Shaw, opposes, asserting that he is prejudiced and that the appeal is hopeless.   [3] With respect to the first of those points, he points to prejudice of a general kind from the litigation but none that is attributable to the short period of delay.  [4] With respect to the second point, Mr Shaw says in substance that the Maori Appellate Court made a sensible and obvious decision in the exercise of discretion.  However, there is a question whether the Maori Land Court had jurisdiction to make the original roadway order and, if not, whether the order could be sustained on appeal to the Maori Appellate Court.  It cannot be said that the appeal is hopeless.  [5] That being so, the application for an extension of time is granted. The appellants must file the case on appeal and apply for a hearing date on or before 20 August 2015.  [6] The respondent being self-represented, therewill be no order as to costs.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 46/2015 [2015] NZSC 116   BETWEEN  RICHARD JOHN CRESER Applicant   AND  JANINE MICHELLE CRESER First Respondent   THE OFFICIALASSIGNEE Second Respondent    Court: Glazebrook, Arnold and O'Regan JJ Counsel: Applicant in person  First Respondent in person Judgment: 29July 2015  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for recall is dismissed.  B The Registrar is directed not to accept for filing any further applications for recall.    REASONS  [1] On 16 July 2015, this Court dismissed Mr Creser’s application for leave to appeal against a decision of Cooper J relating to security for costs.1 On 21 July 2015, this Court dismissed an application for recall of that decision.2  1 Creser v Creser [2015] NZSC 104. 2 Creser v Creser [2015] NZSC 108.  RICHARD JOHN CRESER v JANINE MICHELLE CRESER [2015] NZSC 116 [29July2015]  [2] On 22 July 2015, this Court dismissed a further application for recall and an application for further orders, including applications for joinder of a number of respondents.  [3] Mr Creser has filed yet another application for recall. To a large extent, this application is on the same grounds as the previous recall applications.  As such it is an abuse of process.  [4] Mr Creser also seeks to raise allegations of bias against members of the Court and makes an application for joinder of Brandons Lawyers, a Wellington-based law firm. No reason is given why these allegations were not raised at the time of the leave application or why the application for joinder of Brandons Lawyers was only made at this stage. It is not acceptable to raise on a third recall application matters that could have been raised earlier.3  [5] As to the allegations of bias, Mr Creser now says that O’Regan J had a conflict of interest because his brother is a principal of Brandons Lawyers, the last solicitor on the record acting for the first respondent. The first respondent was, however, not represented before Cooper J or before this Court.4  [6] Mr Creser also alleges that all three of the members of the Court are biased, apparently on the basis that the members of the Court have decided cases against MrCreser in the past and also that Mr Creser’s arguments in his previous applications in this matter were not accepted. Neither of these grounds constitute bias or an appearance of bias.   Result  [7] The applicant’s third application for recall is dismissed.  [8] The Registrar is directed not to accept for filing any further applications for recall in this matter.  3 See Siemer v O’Brien [2015]NZSC 89 at [3].  4 We are not to be taken as necessarily accepting that there would have been a conflict even if Brandons Lawyers had beenacting.

Solicitors: CraigGriffin &Lord,Auckland for Plaintiff Copyto Defendant  BUNNINGS LTD v CLARKE [2015] NZHC 1750[29 July2015]  [1] The plaintiff seeks summary judgment against the defendant, Mr Clarke.  [2] The plaintiff was unable to serve the proceedings. An order for substituted service was made on 29 May 2015. In accordance with that order the proceedings were advertised in the New Zealand Herald on 20 June 2015.  [3] The order as to substituted service required that there be a 25 working day gap between the date of the advertisement and the matter being called in Court. That time period expired on 24 July 2015.  [4] There has been no response from Mr Clarke and nothing has been filed by him.  [5] The relevant rules have been complied with.  [6] I enter judgment against Mr Clarke in the sum of $461,389.21, made up as follows:  (a)  $432,879.91 being the amount claimed;   (b)  Interest on the sum of $424,138.65 at the rate of 7.5 per cent per annum at $87.15 from 2 March 2015 to 28 July 2015 (148 days) ­$12,898.20;   (c)  Disbursements of $4,657.60; and   (d)  Costs on a 2B basis of $10,953.50.

Liability under the guarantee is joint and several.  [2] The proceedings were served on the first defendant on 8 June 2015 and on the second defendant on the same day. The documents served advised that the matter was to be called in Court this morning.  [3] An admission of claim has been signed by the first defendant. No steps have been taken by the second defendant.  [4] The plaintiff is seeking judgment for slightly different sums against each defendant. The amount it seeks judgment for against the second defendant exceeds slightly the amount in respect of which it seeks judgment against the first defendant.  The plaintiff agrees that it will not seek to pursue the first defendant for the difference.  [5] Pursuant to the admission of claim I enter judgment against the first defendant in the sum of $250,647.10 in respect of the guaranteed indebtedness, costs of $7,562, and disbursements of $1,492 – making a total judgment sum of $259,701.10. I decline to award interest at the contract rate as from the date of judgment until the date of payment. Interest merges in the judgment and the judgment will attract interest at the rate set out in s 87 of the JudicatureAct 1908 and r 11.27.  [6] As against the second defendant, I enter judgment in the following amounts: $250,647.10 in respect of the guaranteed debt, costs of $7,610 and disbursements of $1,653.81, making a total judgment sum of $259,910.91. Again, I decline to award interest at the contract rate, and record that interest is to merge in the judgment.  Wylie J

B The applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent.    REASONS  [1] The applicant, Mr Rabson, applies for leave to appeal to this Court against a decision of Randerson J.1 In that decision, Randerson J upheld the decision of the Deputy Registrar of the Court of Appeal refusing to dispense with security for costs for the applicant’s appeal.  [2] The applicant’s underlying appeal relates to judicial review proceedings instituted in the High Court against various decisions of the respondent.   Rabson v Transparency International New Zealand Inc [2015] NZCA 188. While MrJohnCreser was a plaintiff in the High Court, only Mr Rabson sought a review of the Registrar’s decision in the Court of Appeal: see [1] of Randerson J’s judgment. Similarly, the body of Mr Rabson’s application for leave to appeal specifies that only he seeks to appeal Randerson J’s judgment.  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON vTRANSPARENCYINTERNATIONALNEWZEALAND LIMITED [2015]NZSC 111[24July2015 ]  [3] In dismissing the application for review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision, Randerson J applied the principles set out in Reekie v Attorney-General.2 Those principles are settled and the applicant’s application raises no point of public importance.

B The applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondents.  REASONS  Background  [1] Mr Rabson applies for leave to appeal to this Court against a decision of Randerson J.1 In that decision, Randerson J upheld the Registrar of the Court of Appeal’s decision refusing to dispense with security for costs for Mr Rabson’s appeal.  Rabson v Registrar of the Supreme Court [2015] NZCA186.  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON v REGISTRAR OF THE SUPREME COURT[2015] NZSC112[24 July 2015]  [2] Mr Rabson’s underlying appeal relates to judicial review proceedings instituted in the High Court against the Registrar of this Court and other defendants.  Application for Leave to Appeal  [3] Mr Rabson seeks leave to appeal on two grounds.  First, the applicant submits that Randerson J’s decision breached s 27 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 by employing a procedure which limited his access to justice and prevented his right to be heard. He submits this is to be contrasted with another case in the Court of Appeal at the same time.2 Secondly, Mr Rabson submits that Randerson J based his judgment on the basis that the “the New Zealand Supreme Court needs to make the decision”.  Our Assessment  [4] As to the first ground, a similar submission was rejected by this Court in  3 Rabson v Registrar of the Supreme Court.  [5] As to the second ground, Randerson J was merely stating his view that MrRabson’s appeal is not one a reasonable and solvent litigant would pursue.4  [6] No matter of general or public importance arises. Nor is there a risk of a miscarriage of justice.  Result  [7] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  [8] The applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondents.

THE ORDER OF THE COURT OF APPEAL PROHIBITING PUBLICATION OF NAME, ADDRESS, OCCUPATION OR IDENTIFYING PARTICULARS OF WITNESS "MS A" REMAINS IN FORCE.  IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 49/2015 [2015] NZSC 105   BETWEEN  MOHAMMED MUNIF SAHIB Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Court:  William Young, Arnold and O’Regan JJ   Counsel:  D P H Jones QC forApplicant A Markham for Respondent   Judgment:  20 July 2015     JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The case arises out of events which occurred in the early hours of 21 July 2011. The complainant had taken a taxi home late one night but had been dropped off short of her home because she had insufficient money for the full fare. The applicant pulled his motor vehicle over beside her and offered her a lift home. On her evidence he indecently assaulted her, drove past the turn off to the street she lived in, took her to a rural area where he stopped and then further sexually offended against her. He subsequently drove back into Hamilton and dropped her off at a supermarket. Her distressed condition was noticed by some young men who called the police and they stayed with her until the police arrived.  MOHAMMED MUNIF SAHIB v R [2015] NZSC 105 [20 July2015]  [2] The applicant’s defence at trial was as follows: when the complainant got into the car, she made sexual advances to him and indicated that she would have sex for money; he paid her $100; and the sexual activity – on his evidence more limited than that asserted by the complainant – which occurred was consensual.  [3] The Court of Appeal rejected an appeal against sentence and conviction.1 The applicant now seeks leave to appeal in this Court against conviction. The proposed appeal relates to two particular aspects of the case:  (a)  The complainant had worked in a brothel as a prostitute between 2009 and the winter of 2010.  At trial defence counsel was not permitted to cross-examine her as to this.   (b)  The Crown called propensity evidence from a young woman whom the applicant had picked up three weeks earlier as she was walking home in the early hours of the morning. On her evidence, the applicant made sexual advances, offered to pay for sex and would not stop the car to let her out. She escaped by grabbing the gear lever, putting the car into park and running off. The applicant tried to grab her and then followed her in his car but she was able to evade him.    [4] On the first issue, the Court of Appeal concluded2 that the case fell to be determined under s 44(1) and (3) of the EvidenceAct 2006 as relating to prior sexual experience; disagreeing on this point with the trial Judge who had seen s 44(2) (dealing with sexual reputation) as primarily applicable.3 The Court accepted that the complainant’s prior experience as a prostitute was relevant to the defence that the sexual activity which occurred was consensual and for money.4 But given the time which had elapsed since the complainant had worked as a prostitute and the differences between that work (which was in a brothel and thus a controlled  1 Sahib v R [2015] NZCA112 (Stevens,Asher andWilliams JJ) [Sahib (CA)] 2 At [22]. 3 R v Sahib DCHamiltonCRI-2011-019-5616,11 February2014 (Judge Marshall) at [30]. 4 Sahib (CA),  above n1,  at [24].   environment) and what was alleged by the applicant, it saw the relevance of the evidence as marginal and concluded that the s 44(3) test was not met.5  [5] A ruling in the District Court that the propensity evidence was admissible was the subject of an unsuccessful challenge in the Court ofAppeal prior to the final disposition of the trial.6 In the post-trial appeal to which we have referred, the Court ofAppeal saw the propensity evidence as tending to show that the applicant had the tendency of taking advantage of young women by inviting them into his car at night and persisting with sexual activity despite evident lack of consent.7  [6] The applicant challenges the approach taken to s 44 and, as well, the Court of Appeal’s analysis of the propensity evidence and its relevance and maintains that in any event that the prosecutor at trial put too much weight on the propensity evidence and that the directions given by the Judge to the jurywere inadequate.  [7] The case raises no question of general principle. Rather what is in issue is the way in which accepted principles were applied.  [8] We see no appearance of a miscarriage of justice:  (a)  The approach of the Court of Appeal to s 44 was orthodox and unsurprising in the result arrived at.   (b)  On her evidence, the propensity witness was in effect kidnapped (in that the applicant would not let her out of the car) and pursued byhim when she managed to get away in a context in which the applicant was making unwelcome sexual advances to her. The circumstances were remarkably similar to those involving the offending against the complainant which occurred onlythreeweeks later.  There arevarious ways in which the relevance of the propensity evidence could be explained and we are not persuaded that there is an apparent error in    5 At [25]–[30]. 6 Sahib v R [2013] NZCA231. 7 Sahib (CA),  above n1,  at [39].   the wayin which it was analysed bythe Court of Appeal8 or advanced at trial by the prosecutor.  (c) The directions of the Judge were positioned sub-optimally as they were given in the part of the summing up which dealt with the Crown case. But they dealt with the relevance of the propensity evidence appropriately. The defence contentions were put and an appropriate warning was given.  Solicitors: CookMorris Quinn,Auckland forApplicant Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent  At [35]–[40]. It is true that the interactions between the applicant and the propensity witness did not get as far as actual sexual activity but given that the context involved unwelcome sexual overtures and was an effective kidnapping, we have no difficulty with the use by the Court of Appeal ofthe phrase “sexual activity”.  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2014-485-11276 [2015] NZHC 1659  UNDER  Part 5 of the Insolvency Act 2009   IN THE MATTER OF  a proposal made by STEPHEN JOHN   EDWARD PACK    BETWEEN STEPHEN JOHN EDWARD PACK Insolvent  AND ULTRA PROJECTS LIMITED (IN  LIQUIDATION)  Objector  Teleconference: 16 July 2015  Counsel: M Freeman for the Insolvent J C D Corry for the Objector  Judgment: 16 July 2015  JUDGMENT (No. 2) OF ASSOCIATE JUDGE SMITH  [1] On 30 June 2015 Mr Pack’s counsel filed a memorandum inviting me to revisit the order for costs made in the judgment which I gave on 6 May 2015, in which I declined a proposal which Mr Pack had put to his creditors.  [2] In the memorandum, counsel drew to my attention additional evidence (in the form of a letter dated 23 June 2015 from a firm of solicitors who have acted for Mr Pack and/or the SS Pack Family Trust) showing that a debt which I had taken to be owing by Mr Pack’s Family Trust to Mr Pack, which was not disclosed by him in the proposal put to his creditors, had in fact been forgiven by the Trust.  [3] Having considered the solicitors’ letter of 23 June 2015, I accept that what appeared to have been an undisclosed asset of Mr Pack was not in fact an  STEPHEN JOHN EDWARD PACK v ULTRA PROJECTS LIMITED (IN LIQUIDATION) [2015] NZHC 1659 [16 July 2015]  undisclosed asset. The judgment was accordingly in error to the extent that it found that Mr Pack had wrongly failed to disclose to his creditors a substantial asset.  [4] However the circumstances do not justify recalling the judgment, and Mr Pack and his counsel have not asked me to do so. Any error in the judgment lay in my drawing an inference from the evidence which, as circumstances have now shown, was not justified. That would have been a matter for appeal, not recall of the judgment.  [5] I add that if I had been informed that the advances from Mr Pack to the Trust had been forgiven, the result of the application for approval of the proposal would have been the same. The issue relating to the net value of the debts (discussed at paras [82]-[87] of the judgment), and the reasons for my finding that it would have been inexpedient to approve the proposal (set out at paras [88]-[93] of the judgment), each provided a sufficient basis for the decision.  [6] In his memorandum, counsel for Mr Pack invited the Court to confirm its order declining to approve the proposal, but submitted that the Court might (in light of the matters disclosed in the memorandum) consider that costs should not be awarded, or should be ordered in a reduced sum.  [7] I do not see any basis for reducing the costs award.  There was no increase in the amount of costs awarded against Mr Pack because of his apparent failure to disclose a significant asset – the costs were awarded on the normal 2B basis, and remain justified on the basis that the objector was successful with his objection.  [8] In the result, the judgment issued on 6 May 2015 stands. There is no basis for recall, whether on the substantive merits or on the question of costs.  Associate Judge Smith  
         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY    CIV 2014-442-24  [2015] NZHC 1664       BETWEEN     NELSON CITY COUNCIL  Plaintiff      AND     THE YACHT POUNAMU  Defendant       Hearing:     On Papers      Counsel:     M J Logan for Plaintiff      Judgment:     16 July 2015         JUDGMENT (NO 2) OF BROWN J    [1] In my Judgment of 17 April 20151 I made an order in the terms sought that the yacht Pounamu be appraised and sold by way of public tender or, if no satisfactory bids were received by way of tender, by private treaty.  I reserved leave to the plaintiff to apply for further directions should that be required.   [2] In a memorandum dated 16 July 2015 counsel for the plaintiff advises that the Registrar has obtained quotations from two vessel brokers in Nelson, both of whom will charge $3,000 to conduct the tender process.  Because the vessel has now been valued as having a market value between $12,000 and $15,000, the tender cost would be a substantial portion of the potential sale value.   [3] However one of the brokers has indicated that he has a private client who may be interested in purchasing the vessel.  A private treaty sale would have the advantage of avoiding the cost and delay associated with the tender process.  Accordingly the plaintiff seeks a further direction to permit the Pounamu to be sold either by way of private treaty or public tender.    1  Nelson City Council v The Yacht Pounamu [2015] NZHC 752.  [4] I agree that the circumstances are such that a more flexible order is appropriate allowing for sale by private treaty or public tender in the alternative.  Consequently the order at [19] of my earlier Judgment is amended to read as follows:    [19] The Court makes an order that the defendant vessel, Pounamu, be appraised and sold either by way of private treaty or public tender.  [5] Leave is reserved to the Council to apply for further directions should that be required.      ________________________  Brown J    Solicitors:   Pitt & Moore, Solicitors, Nelson  
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA441/2013 [2015] NZCA 307  BETWEEN COLIN BIDOIS, JENNY ROLLESTON, TAARI NICHOLAS, PATRICK NICHOLAS, CHRISTOPHER (KIRITOHA) TANGITU, RAWIRI KUKA AND SHADRACH ROLLESTON AS THE MANDATED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE HAPU OF PIRIRAKAU Appellants  AND RAPATA (ROBERT) LEEF, STEPHANIE TERIA TAIAPA, NADINE HORINA PIRAKE, KAINE RAROA TAIAPA, DARREN WILLIAM LEEF, NEIL HIRAMA AND PANIA ANEISHA BROWN AS THE MANDATED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE HAPU OF NGATI TAKA Respondents  Court: Miller, Cooper and Simon France JJ  Counsel: FMR Cooke QC and M Sharp for Appellants S P Bryers for Respondents  Judgment: 15 July 2015 at 10.30 am (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT TO RECALL JUDGMENT  The application for recall of this judgment is dismissed.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Simon France J)  BIDOIS & OTHERS v LEEF & OTHERS CA 441/2013 [2015] NZCA 307 [15 July 2015]  [1] The appellants seek recall of the judgment issued on 18 May 2015.1 The focus of the application is para [53] of the judgment.  [2] In preparation for settlement of historical claims, the various iwi of Ngati Ranginui agreed a process for settling internal disputes. This was called the Mana Whenua Agreement. It was contemplated the process would be used subsequent to settlement with the Crown. As it happens, all relevant disputes were apparently determined prior to settlement. As the judgment records, the Mana Whenua Agreement was not therefore included amongst the final settlement documentation.  [3] Paragraph [53] of the judgment records that the Mana Whenua Agreement is no longer available. It is this observation the appellants seek to have recalled. They wish in subsequent litigation to argue the Agreement is still operative. A footnote which precedes the paragraph in issue notes that the judgment proceeds on the basis of the position as it presently stands. It was recognised that there may be further litigation about the processes that were followed, and the observation was made that the present judgment is not intended to indicate a view on the merits of any future litigation.  [4] We agree with the respondent that the criteria for recall as set out in Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2) are not met. 2 No special reason exists requiring recall. The judgment is plain that it records the present situation, and the statement in para [53] was acceptance of a specific argument advanced to the Court by Mr Cooke QC on behalf of the respondent. Recall is not the appropriate vehicle for any challenge to the statement.  [5] The application is declined.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND SC 19/2015 [2015] NZSC 100  BETWEEN FRANCISC CATALIN DELIU Applicant AND THE NEW ZEALAND LAW SOCIETY Respondent Court: Elias CJ, Glazebrook and Arnold JJ Counsel: Applicant in person P J Morgan QC for Respondent Judgment: 14 July 2015   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant, Mr Deliu, applies to recall the Court’s judgment in Deliu v New Zealand Law Society dismissing his application for leave to appeal.1 He does so because he does not accept what the Court said about its approach to the award of costs and because he considers that he was not heard on costs.  [2] Applications to recall are granted only on limited grounds, as this Court confirmed in Saxmere Co Ltd v Wool Board Disestablishment Co Ltd (No 2).2 The  only ground that might apply here is that “for some other very special reason justice requires that the judgment be recalled”.   1 Deliu v New Zealand Law Society [2015] NZSC 75.  2 Saxmere Co Ltd v Wool Board Disestablishment Co Ltd (No 2) [2009] NZSC 122, [2010] NZLR 76 at [2], citing Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2) [1968] NZLR 632 at 633. See also Erwood v Maxted [2010] NZCA 93, (2010) 20 PRNZ 466, at [23].  FRANCISC CATALIN DELIU v THE NEW ZEALAND LAW SOCIETY [2015] NZSC 100 [14 July 2015]  [3] In his written submissions in support of his application for leave to appeal, Mr Deliu accepted that the Court had a rationale for its decisions on costs, but noted that it had not always given reasons for differing awards of costs. Mr Deliu referred to this Court’s decision in Manukau Golf Club Inc v Shoye Venture Ltd,3 before concluding:  So, if leave is to be denied me and costs are awarded against me there is nothing to indicate this is not arbitrary. I do not make this allegation, but rather submit the lack of any reasoning process when ordering (or not ordering) costs leaves parties completely uncertain and advocates unable to cogently advise their clients of litigation risks and as such is wrong.  [4] As this extract indicates, Mr Deliu well understood that he was at risk of an award of costs if his application was unsuccessful. Moreover, his reference to Manukau Golf Club Inc v Shoye Venture Ltd indicates that he was aware of the general principle applying to awards of costs, namely that in the normal course, costs follow the event and, where they are within the normal range, no reasons are  required. Mr Deliu’s case fell within that category and there was no suggestion that  it did not. The fact that in other cases no awards are made, whether with or without reasons, does not affect this analysis.  [5] Mr Deliu has raised nothing which causes us to reconsider what is said in our earlier judgment. Accordingly, his application for recall is dismissed.

ORDER PROHIBITING PUBLICATION OF THE JUDGMENT AND ANY PART OF THE PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING THE RESULT) IN NEWS MEDIA OR ON THE INTERNET OR OTHER PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATABASE UNTIL FINAL DISPOSITION OF RETRIAL. PUBLICATION IN LAW REPORT OR LAW DIGEST PERMITTED.  IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND SC 37/2015 [2015] NZSC 103  BETWEEN  RALPH SHERMAN SOLES   Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN   Respondent   Court:  William Young, Glazebrook and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  A R Burns for Applicant   G A Kelly for Respondent    Judgment: 14 July 2015  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B Order prohibiting publication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in news media or on the internet or other publicly available database until final disposition of retrial. Publication in law report or law digest permitted.  REASONS  [1] When allowing the applicant’s appeal against conviction for importing  methamphetamine, the Court of Appeal directed a new trial.1 The applicant now  seeks leave to appeal to this Court; in effect against the order directing a new trial.  Soles v R [2015] NZCA 4 (Ellen France P, White and French JJ). The Court of Appeal gave the reasons for its decision in Soles v R [2015] NZCA 32.  RALPH SHERMAN SOLES v R [2015] NZSC 103 [14 July 2015]  [2] The proposed appeal would be under s 237 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011.  This provides:  237 Right of appeal against determination of first appeal court  (1) A convicted person may, with the leave of the second appeal court,  appeal to that court against the determination of the person’s first  appeal under this subpart.  (2) The High Court or the Court of Appeal must not give leave for a second appeal under this subpart unless satisfied that—  (a)  the appeal involves a matter of general or public importance; or   (b)  a miscarriage of justice may have occurred, or may occur unless the appeal is heard.    For the purposes of this section, the Court of Appeal is the “first appeal court” and this Court is the “second appeal court”.  [3] Since the applicant’s conviction appeal was allowed by the Court of Appeal, it is far from obvious that he remains a “convicted person” for the purposes of s 237(1). As well, given that he will retain his unconvicted status unless and until he is found guilty at the retrial on the evidence then adduced, we are not persuaded that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred or may occur as is required for a grant of leave in these circumstances by s 13(2)(b) of the Supreme Court Act 2003.2  Solicitors: Kayes Fletcher Walker Ltd, Auckland for Applicant Crown Law Office, Wellington for Respondent  The right of appeal conferred by s 237(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 is to be read subject to criteria for leave to appeal set out in s 13 of the Supreme Court Act 2003: see s 12(2) of the latter Act.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  ……………………………………  DELIU vHONG[2015] NZHC 1635[14 July2015]  [1] On 1 March 2015 I delivered judgment in this proceeding, granting the plaintiff’s application for a judicial review of a decision of the New Zealand Lawyers and Conveyancers DisciplinaryTribunal (“the Tribunal”).1  [2] The parties have now submitted memoranda as to costs. Mr Deliu sought scale costs on a 2B basis, together with disbursements as fixed by the Registrar.  MrHong submitted that Mr Deliu is not entitled to costs, on the grounds of MrDeliu’s ulterior motives in pursuing a complaint to the Tribunal, and that the proceeding for judicial review was an abuse of the Court’s processes.  [3] Mr Hong chose not to appear at the hearing of the application for judicial review. Mr Deliu having succeeded in his application, he is entitled to an award of costs. Mr Hong is ordered to pay costs to Mr Deliu on a 2B basis, together with disbursements as fixed by the Registrar. I note that the hearing did not require more than half a day.  [4] I note that Mr Hong has filed a further memorandum “updating the court”.  This is not relevant to the issue of costs, and accordingly does not require comment.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND SC 44/2015 [2015] NZSC 99  BETWEEN  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON Applicant   AND  REGISTRAR OF THE SUPREME COURT First Respondent   MINISTRY OF JUSTICE Second Respondent    Court: Elias CJ, William Young and O'Regan JJ Counsel: Applicant in person  H M Carrad for First and Second Respondents Judgment: 13 July 2015  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the second respondent.  REASONS  [1] This is an application for leave to appeal directly to this Court against a decision of Collins J.1 In that decision, Collins J ordered that the applicant’s application for judicial review of a decision of the first respondent be struck out on the basis that it disclosed no reasonably arguable cause of action.  [2] The application falls to be determined under s 14 of the Supreme Court Act 2003: leave must not be given unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify  Rabson v Registrar of the Supreme Court [2015] NZHC 709.  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON v REGISTRAR OF THE SUPREME COURT [2015] NZSC 99 [13 July 2015]  a direct appeal to this Court. This Court made it clear in a very similar case, Siemer v Registrar of the Supreme Court, that if this Court was ultimately required to determine the issue raised in that case (being the same issue as is raised in this case), it would be assisted by the view of the Court of Appeal.2 The s 14 test was not satisfied in that case and is not satisfied in this case either.  [3] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  [4] We award costs of $2,500 to the second respondent.

IN THE IDGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  AUCKLAND REGISTRY   CIV-2015-404-001151   [2015] NZHC 1621   BETWEEN  YUELEITONG   Plaintiff   AND  ANZ BANK NEW ZEALAND LIMITED   First Defendant (Struck Out)   YEWENWANG   Second Defendant   Hearing:  8 July 2015    Appearances: Ross Dillon for the Plaintiff No appearances for the Second Defendant  Judgment: 10 July 2015  JUDGMENT OF MOORE J  This judgment was delivered by me on 10 July 2015 at 3:00pm pursuant to Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules. Registrar/ Deputy Registrar Date:  TONG v ANZ BANK NEW ZEALAND LIMITED &ANOR [2015] NZHC 1621 [10 July 2015]   [1] The plaintiff in this proceeding seeks an order for specific performance against the second defendant for an agreement for sale and purchase of land. There are also issues relating to a claim of compensation by the plaintiff which it seeks to set off against the purchase price. The second defendant has not filed a statement of defence, and this matter is proceeding by way of formal proof.  [2] Because of the time limits prescribed for certain notices under the Prope1ty Law Act 2007, there is some urgency in the present application. For this reason, this judgment will set out my decision on ce1tain points, with reasons and decisions on the remaining issues to follow.  [3] I hereby order specific performance of the agreement, subject to the following conditions:  (a)  the purchase price is to be reduced by any amount paid or still payable to the first defendant under the mortgage which was transferred pursuant to the earlier decision of Duffy J; and   (b)  of any amount to be paid to the second defendant, the first $200,000 is to be placed in the trust account of the second defendant's solicitor, to be held on trust until the determination of the compensation claim.    [4] I grant leave to any party to apply for any fmther orders necessary to give effect to this judgment.  .  
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA345/2015 [2015] NZCA 291  BETWEEN GAVIN JOHN TUIRA Applicant  AND THE QUEEN Respondent   Counsel: Applicant in Person M Wong for Respondent  Judgment: 9 July 2015 at 11 am (On the papers)   BAIL JUDGMENT OF WILD J  The application for bail pending appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] Mr Tuira applies for bail pending the determination of an appeal against conviction and sentence which he filed on 18 June 2015.   [2] Mr Tuira was sentenced to preventive detention by Faire J in the High Court at Hamilton on 10 March 2015 after he pleaded guilty to charges of injuring with intent, aggravated burglary, assault with a weapon and indecent assault.  [3] Mr Tuira’s notice of appeal indicates that he is not legally represented and does not intend to apply for legal aid.  [4] In his somewhat immoderate handwritten application, Mr Tuira indicates he seeks bail so he “can seek advice how to go about charging the Police The Courts  TUIRAv R CA345/2015[2015] NZCA291 [9 July2015]  and all who represented me after I dismissed them for cheating me off my freedom …”.  [5] The application for bail pendingappeal is declined.  Briefly, my reasons are:  (a)  The appeal lacks merit. The grounds of appeal against conviction appear to be an allegation that the police, courts, his lawyers and the prosecution conspired to have him falsely charged. No grounds for the appeal against sentence are discernible:  s 14(3)(a) BailAct 2000.   (b)  No hearing date for the appeal has yet been fixed. But, given that MrTuira is serving a sentence of preventive detention, the likely delay to the hearing of the appeal will not render it nugatory: ss 14(3)(b) and (c).   (c)  As already mentioned, Mr Tuira wants bail so he can take advice about suing those he holds responsible for his incarceration. As to seeking advice, I note Mr Tuira chose to represent himself when he was sentenced. Faire J’s sentencing remarks record Mr Tuira dispensing with the services of two successive counsel after he had entered his pleas of guilty, during what was obviously a rather protracted sentencing procedure. That is not a proper ground for the grant of bail. Further, the two psychological assessment reports provided to Faire J upon sentencing both assessed Mr Tuira as at high risk of sexual or violent reoffending if released into the community: s 14(3)(d).

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA243/2014 [2015] NZCA 296  BETWEEN  SOS INVESTMENTS LIMITED Appellant   AND  FM CUSTODIANS LIMITED Respondent   Hearing:  8 July 2015   Court:  Miller, Lang and Wylie JJ   Counsel:  R J Katz QC forAppellant R B Stewart QC and N L Penman-Chambers for Respondent   Judgment:  8 July 2015 at 11.11 am     ORAL JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The Court makes the unless order referred to in paragraph [5]. If it is not complied with, the appeal will be dismissed without further hearing. If it is complied with, the timetable directions in paragraph [6] apply.   REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given byMiller J)  [1] This is an appeal against refusal of summary judgment. It was made clear before the hearing that the appellant company, which had filed its own submissions and whose solicitor was given leave to withdraw, must appear by counsel at the hearing.   [2] At the hearing today Mr Katz QC appeared to seek an adjournment. He has only just been instructed and is in no position to argue the appeal on its merits. He anticipates that he will be briefed for the appeal by an instructing solicitor, but he does not presently have one.   [3] The attitude of the respondent is that it wishes to proceed but would prefer a short adjournment to the alternative, which is likely to involve further procedural difficulties.  A fixture is available on 29 July in Wellington.  [4] It must be said that this situation is profoundly unsatisfactory and to grant an adjournment is to extend a considerable indulgence to the appellant, which has failed to explain at all its default in briefing counsel.   [5] Under r 48 ofthe Court of Appeal rules this Court on the hearingofan appeal has all the powers and duties of the High Court concerning procedure. That includes the making of unless orders. Having regard to the appellant’s conduct, we think it is appropriate to make such an order as a condition of an adjournment. We require that New Zealand solicitors confirm to the Registrar that they will become solicitors on the record and will instruct Mr Katz and will protect him for his fee on the hearing of the appeal. We require also that costs of $1500 be paid for today’s adjournment.  Unless both of those steps are undertaken by 5 pm on Friday the appeal will be dismissed without further hearing.  [6] Assuming the unless order is complied with, Mr Katz must file his submissions by 17 July. Mr Stewart must file his submissions in response by 24 July. The hearing will be held on 29 July at Wellington at a time to be fixed by the Registrar. Counsel may appear by video if it is not convenient to appear in Wellington.  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND HAMILTON REGISTRY  CIV-2014-419-0353 [2015] NZHC 1563   UNDER  The Companies Act 1993   BETWEEN  FAIRWAY RESOLUTION LIMITED (FORMERLY DISPUTE RESOLUTION SERVICES LIMITED) Applicant   AND  IAN HENSON Respondent   Hearing:  4 May 2015    (on papers submission from Applicant) Appearances: Ms D Bennington for theApplicant Judgment: 7 July 2015  COSTS JUDGMENT OF ASSOCIATE JUDGE J P DOOGUE  This judgment was delivered by me on  07.07.15  at 4 pm, pursuant to       Rule 11.5  of the High Court Rules.     Registrar/Deputy Registrar   Date……………  FAIRWAYRESOLUTION LIMITED (FORMERLYDISPUTE RESOLUTION SERVICES LIMITED) v HENSON [2015] NZHC 1563[7 July2015]  [1] Submissions have been filed by counsel for the applicant in support of an application for the Court to fix costs in its favour following the hearing and issue of judgment dated 29April 2015.   [2] The key issue is that the application to set aside the statutory demand related to a notice that was the same as one which Mr Henson had previously issued in 2013. Mr Henson withdrew that demand after being served with an application to set it aside. The fact that Mr Henson withdrew the very same statutory demand on an earlier occasion before re-issuing it indicates, at the very least, that he has taken an unmeritorious position. I agree with counsel for the applicant that he was in breach of r 14.6(3)(b)(ii). I also accept that it is at least arguable that he acted in such a way to attract an award of indemnity costs under r 14.6(4) for acting “vexatiously, frivolously, improperly or unnecessarily…”.   [3] However, having regard to the fact that if an indemnity costs order were made Mr Henson would end up paying in excess of $32,000 I take the view that making such an order is not an attractive outcome.  Although I have no information concerning Mr Henson’s financial circumstances my judgment is based upon the material that was placed before the Court by evidence on the hearing of the application that he is not a man of extensive means. Overall I consider that fairness between the parties can be achieved by awarding scale 2B costs with an uplift of 50% for a total of $18,139.50. That figure includes disbursements. The order of the Court is accordingly that Mr Henson is to pay the sum of $18,139.50 in costs.   J.P. Doogue Associate Judge  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  AUCKLAND REGISTRY  CIV-2015-404-501 [2015] NZHC 1552   UNDER  the Companies Act 1993   IN THE MATTER  of an application to set aside a statutory demand   BET WEEN RISECORPINVESTMENTTRUSTEE LIMITED Applicant   AND  STAYWELL HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT LIMITED Respondent   Hearing:  28 May 2015    Appearances: Ms JS Cooper forApplicant Mr DTBroadmore for Respondent (on papers)  Judgment: 6 July 2015  COSTS JUDGMENT OF ASSOCIATE JUDGE J P DOOGUE  This judgment was delivered by me on  06.07.15 at 4 pm, pursuant to      Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules.     Registrar/Deputy Registrar   Date……………  RISECORPINVESTMENTTRUSTEE LIMITED vSTAYWELLHOSPITALITYMANAGEMENTLIMITED [2015] NZHC 1552[6 July2015]  [1] I thank counsel for the helpful memoranda they have both filed concerning the matter of costs.  [2] The view I take is that a broad approach should be taken as to which part has failed which is a relevant matter to take into account pursuant to r 14.2. I do not consider that fine-grained analyses of the extent by which the party failed are called for under the Rules. To take such an approach would derivate from the principle stated at r 14.2(g) that so far as possible the determination of costs should be predictable and expeditious.  [3] If the Court were to exceed to such an approach it would also be put in a position of having to make a decision supplementary to the main decision determining which debts were legitimately claimed for and which not. I do not consider that it is feasible for the Court to resolve those sort of disputes when considering an application to set aside a statutorydemand.   [4] The terms of s 290(4) of the Company’s Act 1993 direct the Court to determine whether there is a substantial dispute whether or not the debt is owing or due. I do not consider that it also requires the Court to go on and determine, in the event that the conclusion is that there is a substantial debt, how much of the debt claimed was due.   [5] For those reasons I accept the submissions of the applicant and approve the 2B costs set out in the schedule annexed to Ms Cooper’s memorandum.    J.P. Doogue Associate Judge  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND PALMERSTON NORTH REGISTRY CRI-2015-054-617 [2015] NZHC 1567  THE QUEEN  v   SCOTT GARETH SIMMONDS  Hearing: 6 July 2015 Counsel: M M Wilkinson-Smith for the Crown P L Murray and A C Whittaker for the Defendant Judgment: 6 July 2015  ORAL JUDGMENT OF MACKENZIE J  Solicitors: Crown Solicitors, Palmerston North  R v SIMMONDS [2015] NZHC 1567 [6 July 2015]  [1] This is an application for variation of electronically monitored bail. Bail was initially granted by me on 25 March 2015. The applicant is on a 24-hour curfew to the bail address which is in Upper Hutt. The application seeks a relaxation of the 24-hour curfew to permit absences from the bailed address for a period of two hours a day and the hours of 1 pm and 3 pm are suggested.   [2] The Crown opposes the variation on the grounds that it is concerned at the prospect of reoffending on bail. The Crown case against the applicant involves the proposition that his involvement in the alleged offending was at the behest of others and the encouragement of others. The Crown submits that there is a risk of association with those involved, or that he may be led into offending while on bail.   [3] The trial is set down for May 2016, so it is still some distance away. There has been no breach of the bail which has now been in force for over three months. Counsel advises that there have been approved absences, which have included travelling to Palmerston North, without incident.   [4] A 24-hour curfew is difficult and the Court needs to be mindful of that difficulty when considering this application. The variation sought is quite modest and will enable the position to be monitored to ensure that there is no breach. consider that the period of two hours a day which is sought is appropriate. I would confine that in the first instance to week days, Monday to Friday of each week, to enable the matter to be assessed and perhaps reconsidered in the future. But that will be a matter for the future.  [5] The application is allowed, to the extent that the permitted absences between 1pm and 3 pm are allowed, on Monday to Friday of each week. The conditions of bail are varied accordingly.  “A D MacKenzie J”  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2015-485-000513 [2015] NZHC 1569  IN THE MATTER  of an appeal under s 42 of the Financial Service Providers (Registration and Dispute Resolution) Act 2008   BETWEEN  VIVIER AND COMPANY LIMITED Appellant   AND  THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AUTHORITY Respondent   Hearing:  6 July 2015   Counsel:  A N Riches and V A Nichols for Appellant M T Scholtens QC and A R Lynes for Respondent   Judgment:  6 July 2015    JUDGMENT OF COLLINS J [Interim Relief]  [1] Vivier and Company Ltd (Vivier) is registered on the Financial Service Providers Register.  [2] On 26 June 2015, the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) directed the Registrar of Financial Service Providers to deregister Vivier from the Financial Service Providers Register.  [3] Vivier has filed a notice of appeal under s 42 of the Financial Service Providers (Registration and Dispute Resolution) Act 2008 (the Act).  [4] Vivier has sought a stay of the FMA’s decision pending the hearing of its appeal.  That application is made under s 43 of the Act, which provides:  VIVIER AND CO LTD v THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AUTHORITY [2015] NZHC 1569 [6 July 2015]  Unless the High Court orders otherwise, a decision [or direction] appealed against under section 42 continues in effect.  [5] Ms Scholtens QC had only received instructions earlier today and properly  advised that the FMA could neither consent or oppose Vivier’s application.  [6] I have arranged for the stay to be heard on 21 July 2015. In the meantime, I  will issue a temporary stay in order to ensure Vivier’s appeal is not rendered nugatory. 1 This is because the effect of the FMA’s decision is that Vivier is no longer registered and it is reasonably arguable Vivier is likely to suffer serious harm if it is unable to be registered at least until its application for a stay can be fully heard and determined.   [7] I accordingly issue a stay under s 43 of the Act and direct the Registrar of Financial Service Providers to reinstate Vivier on the Financial Service Providers Register until further order of this Court. Unless I make this order the stay is futile.  [8] Vivier’s substantial appeal will be heard on 24 August 2015. I am advising the parties of this hearing date so that if a timetable direction is required, the parties can submit memoranda to me this week for consideration.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND SC 40/2015 [2015] NZSC 97  BETWEEN  SPORTZONE MOTORCYCLES LIMITED (IN LIQUIDATION) First Applicant   MOTOR TRADE FINANCES LIMITED Second Applicant   AND  COMMERCE COMMISSION Respondent    Court: William Young, Arnold and O'Regan JJ Counsel: D J Goddard QC and I J Thain for Applicants S J Mills QC and K C Francis for Respondent Judgment: 2 July 2015  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is granted (Sportzone Motorcycles Ltd (in liq) and Motor Trade Finances Ltd v Commerce Commission [2015] NZCA 78).  B The approved question is:  Did the Court of Appeal err in finding that the fees charged by the applicants were unreasonable for the purposes of s 41 of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003?  REASONS  [1] Leave is granted only on the question set out above. The Court does not  consider that the second question on which the applicants sought leave meets the  SPORTZONE MOTORCYCLES LIMITED (IN LIQUIDATION) v COMMERCE COMMISSION [2015] NZSC 97 [2 July 2015]  criteria set out in s 13 Supreme Court Act 2003.1 The point is specific to the facts of the present case and therefore does not give rise to a point of general or public importance or a matter of general commercial significance. We see no appearance of a miscarriage of justice if leave is refused.  [2] The grant of leave does not extend to the point raised in para 4.11 of the submissions for the applicants relating to fees charged to the first applicant by the second applicant and passed on by the first applicant to debtors. We do not consider the statutory criteria are met in relation to that issue and the difficulties identified in the Court of Appeal arising from the point not being raised in the High Court would also arise in this Court if leave were granted.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 41/2015 [2015] NZSC 96   BETWEEN  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON Applicant   AND  JUDICIAL CONDUCT COMMISSIONER First Respondent   AILSA DUFFY Second Respondent   Court:  William Young, Arnold and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person LTheron and C PA Cross for First Respondent    Judgment: 1 July 2015  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant is to pay the first respondent costs of $2,500.    REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a judgment of Brown J in the High Court1 dismissing as an abuse of process judicial review proceedings challenging the conduct of the first respondent in relation to a complaint made by a third party against the second respondent. The third party – a declared vexatious litigant – had previously unsuccessfully sought leave to commence very similar  Rabson v Judicial Conduct Commissioner [2015] NZHC 714.  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON v JUDICIALCONDUCTCOMMISSIONER [2015] NZSC 96[1 July2015]  judicial review proceedings.2 This application was declined on the basis that the proposed proceedings would be an abuse of process.  [2] As well as applying for leave to appeal to this Court, the applicant also appealedto the Court ofAppeal. He has,however, been required to pay securityfor costs. In support of the contention that we should grant leave to appeal direct to this Court, he asserted in his leave application that the “oppressive security for costs regime” will prevent him appealing to the Court of Appeal.3 We assume therefore that he does not propose to provide security.   [3] The application does not meet the criteria specified in s 14 of the Supreme Court Act 2003. Theproposed appeal does not involve amatterof general orpublic importance and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice. We are not satisfied that it is in the interests of justice for this Court to hear and determine the proposed appeal. As well, there are no exceptional circumstances that would justify an appeal to this Court.  Solicitors: MeredithConnell,Wellingtonfor First Respondent  2 Re Judicial Conduct Commissioner [2014] NZHC 2712.  3 The argument that leave should be granted for direct appeal from the High Court because of the requirement to pay security for costs in the Court of Appeal was rejected in Siemer v Brown [2015] NZSC 41 at [4]–[6].  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2015-485-345 [2015] NZHC 1502  UNDER the Trustee Act 1956  IN THE MATTER OF the estate of JAMES MITCHELL BROCKIE  BETWEEN DEBORAH ELSIE HEKE Plaintiff  AND GLENDA JULIE BROCKIE Defendant  On papers  Judgment: 1 July 2015   JUDGMENT OF DOBSON J  [1] The statement of claim in this proceeding seeks an order under s 51 of the Trustee Act 1956 appointing the Public Trust as sole trustee in place of Deborah Elsie Heke and Glenda Julie Brockie, the trustees appointed under the will of the late James Mitchell Brockie. The statement of claim also seeks an order vesting in the Public Trust the remaining funds of the estate, and directing that the remaining funds be paid to the Public Trust for that purpose.   [2] The Court has previously directed that service be effected on Ms Brockie by email at her known email address, glenda.besttaxi@gmail.com, and also by service on solicitors, Bruce Young of Wellington and Maude & Miller of Porirua. There is now evidence of service by those means.   [3] There has been no response from Ms Brockie, although an email reaction to a letter foreshadowing the present action was dispatched from her email address to Mr Young and Mr Langford, separate Wellington solicitors who appear to have acted  HEKE v BROCKIE [2015] NZHC 1502 [1 July 2015]  for her. That communication indicated opposition to the proposed retirement of the existing trustees and appointment of the Public Trust.  It included:  This attachment [the deed of retirement and appointment of trustees] will not be auctioned [sic] or even considered by myself until the other issues and  estate bills are paid, one being the IRD returns for dad’s estate.   Again I say get real people. Step up and take responsibility for your actions and sort these issues out honestly.   That’s my final word.  [4] In the absence of a response to the proceedings, the Court accepts the state of impasse as pleaded in the statement of claim.  That renders the retirement of existing trustees and appointment of the Public Trust an appropriate step. Subject to the conditions described below, that relief will be granted.   [5] There remains a practical prospect that Ms Brockie is unaware of the consequences of not taking a step in the proceedings. Accordingly, the retirement of the present trustees and appointment of the Public Trust as the replacement trustee is subject to solicitors for the plaintiff ensuring that all documents relevant to the estate and any difference between the plaintiff and Ms Brockie in relation to its administration are provided to the Public Trust, together with the records held by Maude & Miller in relation to their acting in the estate thus far.   [6] The Public Trust is charged with seeking an indication of views from Ms Brockie before administering the balance of the estate, and to that extent leave is reserved for the Public Trust to apply for directions if that becomes appropriate.   [7] There will be no order as to costs on these proceedings.  Dobson J  Solicitors: Greg Kelly Law, Wellington for plaintiff

Ms Rani must pay the fee of $1,100 to the Registrar by 30 July 2015.   REASONS  [1] Ms Rani applies for review of the Registrar’s decision to decline to waive court fees for her appeal.1  [2] I am satisfied that the Registrar was correct to decline to waive the fee. I too am not persuaded that Ms Rani would suffer undue hardship if required to pay the fee. She is reliant in part on a benefit, but she also has a modest income from what  Section100B Judicature Act 1908.  SANTOSH RANI v DEO RAJAN &ANOR CA231/2015[2015] NZCA281 [30 June2015]  appears to be afamilybusiness. Her principal liabilityis ahirepurchase agreement.

Ms Rani must paythe fee of $1,100 to the Registrar by 30 July2015.  Solicitors: Parshotam Lawyers,Auckland for Respondent  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND SC 55/2015 [2015] NZSC 95  BETWEEN  JOHN FREDERICK ERICSON Applicant   AND  CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, William Young and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person K M Muller for Respondent   Judgment:  29 June 2015    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant, Mr Ericson, is serving a sentence of life imprisonment following his conviction on a charge of murder. He seeks leave to appeal against a decision of the Court of Appeal1 upholding a decision of Nation J in the High Court dismissing his application for a writ of habeas corpus. 2 The essential ground of the leave application is that Mr Ericson considers that he is being held in prison under an invalid warrant of commitment. Mr Ericson alleges that the warrant held by the prison authorities is a photocopy rather than the original.  [2] The Court of Appeal held that there was no doubt that the High Court Judge who had sentenced Mr Ericson, Panckhurst J, had signed the necessary warrant of  1 Ericson v Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2015] NZCA 199 [Ericson (CA)]. 2 Ericson v Superintendent of Christchurch Men’s Prison [2015] NZHC 756.  JOHN FREDERICK ERICSON v CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS [2015] NZSC 95 [29 June 2015]  commitment. That was sufficient to authorise Mr Ericson’s detention.3 Moreover, although it was not necessary that the penal institution concerned hold the original of the warrant, the Court was satisfied that it did in fact hold the original warrant.4  [3] We are not satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice that the Court hear and determine this appeal. It raises no issue of general or public importance, nor is there any risk of a serious miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OFNEWZEALAND  SC 24/2015  [2015] NZSC 92   BETWEEN  VINCENT ROSS SIEMER Applicant   AND  CLARE O'BRIEN First Respondent   ATTORNEY-GENERAL Second Respondent    Court: Elias CJ, William Youngand O'Regan JJ Counsel: V R Siemer in person  D L Harris for First and Second Respondents Judgment: 26 June 2015  JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  The application for recall of the Court’s judgment in Siemer v O’Brien & Anor [2015] NZSC 63 is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant applies for the recall of our judgment dismissing his application for leave to appeal a decision ofWhite J.1  [2] In that judgment, we said the applicant challenged the participation of the second respondent in an appeal to the Court of Appeal (CA 693/2014).2 The applicant says this misstated his appeal ground in CA 693/2014 and seeks a correction to set out in detail his argument as to why he challenged the second respondent’s participation.  1 Siemer v O’Brien & Anor [2015] NZSC 63. 2 At [1].   SIEMER v O'BRIEN &ANOR [2015] NZSC 92[26 June2015]  [3] The application raises no point justifying recall of the judgment. There was no need for the Court to set out in full what the basis on which the challenge to the participation of the second respondent in the appeal was pursued.  [4] The application for recall is therefore dismissed.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondents 
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CIV-2015-404-1083 [2015] NZHC 1433  UNDER the Land TransferAct 1952, section 145A  INTHE MATTER of registered caveat 9865590.1 on CTNA18B.54  BETWEEN  ASB BANK LIMITED (398445)   Applicant   AND  LJ HOLDINGS (NO 1) LIMITED   Respondent   Hearing:  On the papers   Counsel:  EC Gellert for applicant   RO Parmenter for respondent   Judgment:  24 June 2015    JUDGMENT OF FAIRE J  This judgment was delivered by me on 24 June 2015 at 11 am, pursuant to Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules.  Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Date……………  Solicitors: SimpsonGrierson,Auckland WinstonWang&Associates,Auckland  ASB Bank Limited (398445) vLJ Holdings (No1) Limited [2015] NZHC 1433[24June2015]  [1] The applicant, who has an equitable interest in the respondent’s land by virtue of an unregistered mortgage, applied to sustain a caveat it had lodged.  [2] At the first call of the application counsel advised that an order as moved could be made byconsent.  I made the order.  [3] In relation to costs, I ordered as follows:  [2] Costs are reserved. Memoranda are to be filed. Counsel are agreed that if costs are ordered they should be assessed on a 2B basis. The question is should costs be ordered. The respondent shall file and serve memoranda setting its position by 2 June 2015. The applicant shall file and serve submissions in reply by 9 June 2015. The file shall be referred to me to determine the question of costs.   [4] The applicant seeks costs on a 2B basis of $4,875.50 plus disbursements of $590. The calculation appears to bea correct 2B calculation.  [5] Therespondent had sought to use the s 145Aprovisions ofthe Land Transfer Act 1952 as a way of enforcing advice as to the amount required to settle the mortgage from the applicant Bank. The caveat approach adopted, clearly, is not the correct way to deal with that problem.  [6] The applicant is successful in this case. I see no reason to depart from the normal position required by r 14.2(a), namely that the person who fails with respect to an application should paycosts to the party who succeeds.  [7] Accordingly, I order that the respondent pay the applicant’s costs of $4,875.50 plus disbursements of $590.  JA Faire J 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 130/2014 [2015] NZSC 89   BETWEEN  VINCENT ROSS SIEMER Applicant   AND  CLARE O'BRIEN First Respondent   ATTORNEY-GENERAL Second Respondent   Court:  Glazebrook, Arnold and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person D L Harris for First and Second Respondents   Judgment:  23 June 2015    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall is dismissed.   REASONS  [1] Mr Siemer has filed an application for recall of the Court’s judgment refusing him leave to appeal in SC 130/20141 and for recall of the Court’s reissued judgment on that application.2 The ground for the application is that the Court could not, in the circumstances, properlymake an order for costs in favour of theAttorney-General.  [2] This application is an abuse of process. We make two points. First, as the Court said in Deliu v New Zealand Law Society, costs normally follow the event.3 Where that occurs, and the costs awarded are within the normal range, no reasons are  1 Siemer v O’Brien [2015] NZSC 13. This is Mr Siemer’s third application for recall of that judgment.  2 Siemer v O’Brien [2015] NZSC79.  3 Deliu v New Zealand Law Society [2015] NZSC 75.  VINCENTROSS SIEMER vCLARE O'BRIEN [2015] NZSC89 [23 June2015]  required.4 Of necessity, the Attorney-General had to intervene in the present proceedings as the first respondent, who is the Registrar of the Court of Appeal, abided the decisions of the courts, and a contradictor was required. Counsel for the Attorney-General filed written submissions opposing Mr Siemer’s application for leave to appeal. The Court declined Mr Siemer’s application. In those circumstances, Mr Siemer was at risk of an award of costs against him, in accordance with the normal practice. Given his extensive experience in this Court, Mr Siemerought to have been well aware of that.  [3] Second, Mr Siemer has attempted to raise in a sequence of recall applications points that could and should have been raised in the first application. A party seeking recall of a judgment must raise all points in support of the application together: where the points raised could have been raised at the outset, serial attempts at recall of the same judgment are an abuse of process.  [4] Theapplication for recall is dismissed.  There is no order for costs.  [5] The Registrar is directed not to accept any further applications for recall from Mr Siemer in relation to this matter.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 53/2015   [2015] NZSC 88   BETWEEN  RICHARD LYALL GENGE   Applicant   AND  CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFTHE   DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS   Respondent   Court:  William Young, Glazebrook and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person   P J Gunn and S J Humphrey for Respondent   Judgment:  22 June 2015    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant is currently serving a life sentence for murder imposed in October 1995 and is detained pursuant to a warrant of commitment issued under s143 oftheCriminal JusticeAct 1985. Hecontends that as aresultofthe repeal of that Act by the Sentencing Act 2002, the warrant of commitment is of no effect and he seeks release accordingly.  [2] His application for habeas corpus was dismissed by Mander J1 and his subsequent appeal from that judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.2 He now seeks leave to appeal from the latter decision.   1 Genge v Superintendent of Christchurch Men’s Prison [2014] NZHC 705 [Genge (HC)]. 2 Genge v Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2015] NZCA157 [Genge (CA)].  RICHARD LYALLGENGE v CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFTHE DEPARTMENTOF CORRECTIONS[2015] NZSC 88 [22 June 2015]  [3] In his application and other material provided by the applicant, he complained about the hearing he was accorded in the Court of Appeal. He also has indicated that he has some concerns as to parole. In a letter of 31 May however, he advised that he had obtained legal advice to the effect that in the context of the present application, this Court is the “wrong forum” for the ventilation of his parole concerns. He asked that the proceedings “be changed from habeas corpus to a judicial review, to be heard in a lower court”. However, the applicant subsequently wrote a further letter (of 10 June) indicating a desire to pursue his application.  [4] As the applicant was advised, the present proceedings do not provide an appropriate context for consideration of parole issues.   [5] The judgments of the High Court and Court of Appeal adequately explain why the applicant’s detention is still authorised by the 1995 warrant notwithstanding the repeal of theCriminal JusticeAct.3 Ifthe applicant’s submissions in theCourt of Appeal were curtailed as he claims, that is unsurprising given the obvious validity of his detention. The proposed appeal raises no question of law of public or general importance and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.

CLAYTON v CLAYTON (NO2) [2015] NZHC 1392[19 June 2015]  [1] In mydecision delivered on 24 March 2015 Iheld that, as amatteroflaw, the statutory scheme for final maintenance orders does not preclude a final maintenance order making an allowance for legal expenses in relation to ongoing litigation between the parties. As a result, this ground of Mr Clayton’s appeal against a final maintenance order requiring him to pay $10,000 per month towards Mrs Clayton’s legal and accounting feesfailed.1 Mrs Clayton seeks costs on that decision.  [2] Costs would ordinarily follow the event. In the usual course, Mrs Clayton would be entitled to costs on a 2B basis. Mr Clayton resists costs on the ground that since June 2014 he has paid a total of $309,019 by way of maintenance ($110,000), court costs ($129,019) and an interim distribution of relationship property ($70,000).  In these circumstances he contends that a further award is inappropriate.  [3] The provision for legal costs in the maintenance order was made in order to equip Mrs Clayton to resolve the complex relationship property litigation. The fact that she receives maintenance payments specificallyfor the purpose of meeting legal costs would be a factor to take into account in deciding whether there should be a departure from the rule of awarding costs to the successful party in the context of those proceedings. However, the current application concerns the maintenance proceedings. In these proceedings it is not appropriate to take into account the amount that Mr Clayton has paid by way of maintenance or by way of court costs in the relationship property proceedings. The litigation is to be treated on a normal stand-alone basis that attracts costs following the event.  [4] There are to be costs in Mrs Clayton’s favour on a 2B basis. I do not, however, accept the reasons advanced for the higher costs claimed in Ms Hosking’s memoranda.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OFNEWZEALAND  SC 130/2014  [2015] NZSC 78   BETWEEN  VINCENT ROSS SIEMER Applicant   AND  CLARE O'BRIEN First Respondent   ATTORNEY-GENERAL Second Respondent   Court:  Glazebrook, Arnold and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person D L Harris for First and Second Respondents   Judgment:  5 June 2015    JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  The applicant’s second applicationfor recall is dismissed.   REASONS  [1] Mr Siemer applied for leave to appeal directly to this Court from the judgment of Williams J in Siemer v O’Brien.1 We dismissed his application.2 MrSiemer then asked that the Court recall its judgment, on the basis that the Court did not properly understand the basis for his leave application. We dismissed that application also.3 Mr Siemer has now filed a second application for recall of our judgment dismissing his application for leave.  [2] The basis of the further application is that in the formal judgment of the Court set out in the judgment band, Mr Siemer is ordered to pay the respondents  1 Siemer v O’Brien [2014] NZHC 2886. 2 Siemer v O’Brien [2015] NZSC 13. 3 Siemer v O’Brien [2015] NZSC 23.  VINCENTROSS SIEMER vCLARE O'BRIEN [2015] NZSC78 [5 June2015]  (plural) costs of $2,500 plus reasonable disbursements, whereas in the body of the judgment the order is recorded as being that Mr Siemer paythe respondent (singular) costs of $2,500 plus reasonable disbursements. Mr Siemer submits that this makes the judgment “incomprehensible on the order of costs” and says that “there is no way of comprehending from reading the Judgment as issued to whom costs were awarded in favour”.  [3] Obviously, there is a typographical error in the leave judgment, but it is one which is immaterial in the present case. As we recorded in the leave judgment, MrSiemer has issued judicial review proceedings in respect of certain decisions of the first respondent, whois the Registrar ofthe Court ofAppeal. Shehas not played an active part in the proceedings but, rather, has abided the courts’ decisions. Accordingly, as commonly occurs in such situations, the Attorney-General appeared before the High Court to act as contradictor, and has maintained that role subsequently. Given that the Crown Law Office is the solicitor on the record for both respondents, Mr Siemer can meet his obligation to pay costs by paying the $2,500 plus reasonable disbursements to the Office.  [4] Given that the error is immaterial, we see no reason to recall our judgment, but will re-issue it with the typographical error removed, by virtue of our implied power to correct such slips.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar ……………………………………  Solicitors: Mr M R Crottyand MrAJ Nelder, Russell McVeagh, Solicitors,Auckland  RE SPIRITOF ADVENTURE TRUSTBOARD [2015] NZHC 1212[3 June2015]  [1] The Spirit of Adventure Trust Board has applied under s 64A of the Trustee Act 1956 to vary the terms of a charitable trust deed. The application is necessary because the existing trust deed has no clause entitling the Board, or its member trustees, to vary the terms. As a result the Board itself could vary the terms only if all the beneficiaries of the Trust consent. It is not possible to obtain a consent of all beneficiaries because they are an unascertained group – young people of New Zealand.  [2] The application was supported by a comprehensive affidavit of Mr Stephen Fisher, the current chairman of the Spirit of Adventure Trust Board. Having read that affidavit and the supporting documents, I was satisfied that the order sought should be made. This was subject to two minor points, which are appropriately described as points of drafting.   [3] The points of drafting have been clarified in a supplementary affidavit from Mr Fisher and a memorandum of counsel.  [4] Applying the provisions of s 64A of the Trustee Act and the principles developed in the cases I am satisfied that the application should now be granted.

[2] Mr Ogilvie, counsel for the defendant, subsequently made application for an award of costs in the sum of $3,000. The application was based on the actual costs incurred by the defendant in respect of attendances in relation to the good faith report requested by the Court and all attendances in connection with the actual hearing of the challenge which were said to total $5,175.  [3] No cost submissions have been filed in response to Mr Ogilvie’s application.  The Registrar has indicated that the advocate for the plaintiff has received no instructions in the matter.  1 Mega Wreckers Ltd v Taafuli [2014] NZEmpC 234. 2 Taafuli v Mega Wreckers Ltd [2014] NZERA Wellington 2.

[2] It has emerged on appeal that there was material the applicant wished to place before the Court but, for reasons which do not matter, that did not transpire.  As it happens, considerable evidence has now been filed by both parties, and cross-examination will be required.  The appeal would in effect be a new hearing.    1  Keung v NZ Police [2015] NZDC 797.  [3] In the circumstances, and with the agreement of the parties, I consider the best course is to allow the appeal, set the decision aside, and remit the matter to the District Court for hearing.  That process will re-establish the correct order of things, and preserve the full first appeal court appeal right proffered by s 271 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011.      _________________________  Simon France J    Solicitors:   O’Donoghue Webber, Crown Solicitors, Nelson    
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA858/2011 [2015] NZCA 184   BETWEEN  JOHN APPLETON AND NATALIE MARIE RYAN AS TRUSTEES OF THE APPLETON FAMILY TRUST First Appellant   JOHN APPLETON Second Appellant   AND  TAURANGA LAW Respondent   Court:  O'Regan P, French and Winkelmann JJ   Counsel:  D W Grove for Appellants P J Napier and A K Hyde for Respondent    Judgment: 21 May 2015 at 10.00 am (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The appellants must pay the respondent the costs and disbursements that have been agreed by the parties for a standard appeal on a band A basis with usual disbursements without any allowance for second counsel.   REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by French J)  APPLETON v TAURANGA LAW CA858/2011[2015] NZCA 184 [21 May 2015]  [1] On 6 September 2013, we allowed an appeal by the appellants against a decision of the High Court.1  [2] On 19 February 2015, the Supreme Court set aside our judgment including a costs order we had made in favour of the appellants.2  [3] The Supreme Court further directed that if the parties could not agree on costs in this Court, then we were to set costs in light of the Supreme Court judgment.  [4] The parties have been able to agree on costs except on the issue of whether there should be an allowance for second counsel as claimed by the now successful respondent.  [5] In our view, the claim for second counsel is not justified. This was a relatively simple appeal which turned essentially on its facts. It did not occupy significant hearing time.  [6] We therefore decline to certify for second counsel.  [7] We order that the appellants must pay the respondent the costs that have been agreed for a standard appeal on a band A basis with usual disbursements without any allowance for second counsel.

IN THE EMPLOYMENT COURT AUCKLAND [2015] NZEmpC 69 ARC 61/14  IN THE MATTER OF  a challenge to a determination of the Employment Relations Authority   AND IN THE MATTER  of an application for stay of proceedings   BETWEEN  YASODHARA DA SILVEIRA SCARBOROUGH Plaintiff    AND MICRON SECURITY PRODUCTS LIMITED Defendant Hearing: On papers filed on 22 April and 1, 4, 6, 12 and 14 May 2015 Appearances: Plaintiff in person D France and S Worthy, counsel for defendant Judgment: 18 May 2015  INTERLOCUTORY JUDGMENT OF JUDGE CHRISTINA INGLIS  [1] The plaintiff applies for a stay of proceedings. The application arises against the backdrop of the plaintiff's unsuccessful challenge1 to a determination of the Employment Relations Authority2 and the plaintiff's subsequent application for a rehearing, which was filed concurrently with the application for a stay.  [2] The defendant opposes any stay. The parties were given an opportunity to indicate whether they had any objection to the application being dealt with on the papers and neither has done so. I proceed on the basis of the documentation before the Court.  1 Scarborough v Micron Security Products Ltd [2015] NZEmpC 39. 2 Scarborough v Micron Security Products Ltd [2014] NZERA Auckland 231.  YASODHARA DA SILVEIRA SCARBOROUGH v MICRON SECURITY PRODUCTS LIMITED NZEmpC AUCKLAND [2015] NZEmpC 69 [18 May 2015]  [3] In determining an application for stay the Court is required to balance the competing rights of each party.  The overriding consideration is the interests of justice.3  [4] The first point is that no orders were made against the plaintiff in the Court's substantive judgment and the only order that may result, namely as to costs, has yet to be determined. Further, there is nothing before the Court to suggest that the plaintiff would be unable to proceed with her application for rehearing, or that it would otherwise be rendered nugatory, by the lack of a stay. Nor is there anything to suggest that her position would be prejudiced in any way at this stage.   [5] The defendant succeeded in defending the plaintiff's challenge. It has an interest in finality and a right to enjoy the fruits of its success.   [6] I am not satisfied that it is appropriate for a stay to be granted and I decline to do so.  [7] The defendant is entitled to costs on the application, the quantum of which is reserved.  [8] It is desirable that the plaintiff's application for a rehearing be dealt with as soon as possible. A telephone conference should be convened with an available Judge at the earliest opportunity to timetable the application to a hearing.

B The applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the second respondent.    REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a decision of White J dismissing his application for review of a decision of the Deputy Registrar of the Court of Appeal refusing to dispense with security for costs.1 The applicant has challenged the participation of the second respondent in the appeal (CA 693/2014) and says security for costs should not have been ordered in favour of the second respondent.  Siemer v O’Brien [2015] NZCA86 (White J).  SIEMER v O'BRIEN &ANOR [2015] NZSC 63[15 May2015]  [2] This Court has alreadydismissed the applicant’s objection to the participation of the second respondent in the appeal (CA 693/2014).2 In dismissing the application for review, White J applied the principles set out in Reekie v Attorney-General.3 Those principles are settled and no point of public importance arises.  There is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.  [3] The application is therefore dismissed.  [4] The applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the second respondent.

Sutherland ~ Deputy Registrar  RagistrarJDeputy Registrar  Solicitors: Crown Solicitor, New Plymouth Counsel: JC Hannam, New Plymouth  JOHNS v THE QUEEN [2015] NZHC 1033 [15 May 2015]  [1] On 20 April 2015, I heard an appeal by Mr Johns against his conviction on one charge of having a sexual connection with a young person under the age of 16 years, and his appeal against the sentence imposed of two years and two months imprisonment.  [2] I indicated, following the hearing, that I expected to give judgment within the following two weeks. Due to other judicial commitments of a heavier nature than I had anticipated at the time, that has not proved possible. However, I have reached a conclusion on the conviction appeal, and consider it best to give that decision now. My judgment on the appeal against sentence remains reserved.  [3] The appeal against conviction is dismissed. Reasons for that decision will be given as soon as time permits. A judgment on the sentence appeal will be delivered contmeporaneously.

B We make no award of costs.  REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a procedural direction given by White J1 in the Court of Appeal dismissing a challenge by the applicant to the participation by the second respondent in an appeal to the Court of Appeal.  [2] White J said the applicant’s challenge to the position of the second respondent was unarguable. The applicant had suggested that Crown counsel had misrepresented the position of the second respondent. White J found there had been no misrepresentation.  Siemer v O’Brien CA 693/2014, 26 March 2015.  SIEMER v O'BRIEN & ANOR [2015] NZSC 64 [15 May 2015]  [3] This Court has already ruled that the applicant’s argument against the second respondent’s participation in the proceedings was not an arguable point, in a decision dealing with an application for leave to appeal directly to this Court, Siemer v O’Brien.2 This Court said:3  … the application does not raise any arguable point. It is commonplace for  judicial and other officers to abide the decision of the court and, if there is no other contradictor, for the Attorney-General to appear and make submissions.  [4] The present application is essentially a re-litigation of the same point. As the point the applicant seeks to raise in his intended appeal to this Court is unarguable, his application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  [5] Costs of $2,500 were awarded to the second respondent in relation to another application, SC 24/2015.4 As the second respondent’s submissions related to both that matter and this one, only one award of costs is warranted. We therefore make no award in relation to the present application.

BEFORE THE ENVIRONMENT COURT  Decision: [2015] NZEnvC ENV-2014-WLG-000046  IN THE MATTER of an appeal under s120 ofthe Resource Management Act 1991  BETWEEN A J and RM TEASDALE Appellants  AND THE WELLINGTON REGIONAL COUNCIL Respondent  Court: Environment Judge CJ Thompson  Environment Commissioner W R Howie Heard: at Wellington on 30 April 2015 Counsel: R J B Fowler QC for A J and RM Teasdale  M J Slyfield for Te Marua Golf Club Inc -applicant K M Anderson & A J Schriiffer for the Wellington Regional Council   DECISION -CORRECTION  Issued; May 2015   2  [1] In a decision issued on 5 May 2015 ([2015] NZEnvC 85), the Court declined the appeal brought by Mr and Mrs Teasdale against the grant by the Wellington Regional Council of two resource consents to the Te Marna Golf Club Inc.  [2] Counsel for the parties have brought the Court's attention to an error in that decision. At para [12], we said this: One needs to start with the relevant effects, if any, of existing activities ( or works/structures). Possible adverse erosion effects on the Teasdale land of the existing structures/work on the golf course are rated by both Mr John Philpott, the consulting engineer engaged by the Golf Club, and Mr James Flanagan, the Council's  engineer, as .. .no effect. Mr Hall ranks the risk as ... unlikely to be any measurable effect.  [3] The last sentence is incorrect. Mr Hall, as recorded in the Joint Witness Statement made by the three engineering witnesses, has the view that the existing works do have an effect on the Teasdale land.  [4] We very much regret, and apologise for, that error. We should make it clear however that the inadvertent misstatement of Mr Hall's position on the existing works does not alter our views on the ultimate outcome in respect of the proposed works, noting in particular Mr Hall's concession that the proposed works will be unlikely to cause an adverse effect, whether or not the existing works remain.

REASONS  [1] Pursuant to r 7(2) of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005, the appellants sought a review of a judgment I gave on 16 March 2015.1 The appellants filed their application on 23 March.  [2] The same day the Registrar refused to accept that review application for filing and returned it to the appellants. The reason given was that review is only available of a decision made under s 61A(1) of the Judicature Act 1908. My decision was made under s 61A(3).   Siemer v Brown [2015] NZCA69.  SIEMER v BROWN & ORS CA31/2015[2015] NZCA161[12 May2015]  [3] On 31 March the appellants sought review of the Registrar’s decision refusing to accept their review application.  [4] The Registrar’s decision is correct, as at least the appellant Mr V R Siemer well knows: Siemer v Judicial Conduct Commissioner & Ors [2013] NZSC 112, particularly at [3].  [5] Accordingly, having reviewed the Registrar’s decision, I uphold it.  [6] The appellants’ remedy is to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, which I note they did on 31 March.

REASONS  [1] Mr Rabson seeks leave to appeal against a judgment of Mallon J in the High Court where she struck out the applicant’s judicial review proceedings against the Registrar of this Court.1  [2] Under s 14 of the Supreme Court Act 2003, the Supreme Court cangive leave to appeal directly to it against a decision of the High Court only in exceptional circumstances.  Rabson v Registrar of the Supreme Court [2015] NZHC 403.  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON v REGISTRAR OF THE SUPREME COURT[2015] NZSC55[8 May2015]  [3] As was recognised by this Court in Siemer v Registrar of the Supreme Court, in almost identical circumstances, “[i]f this Court is ultimately required to determine the procedural issue – as to whether judicial review is available in the High Court in respect of the Registrar’s decisions – it will be much assisted by the views of the Court ofAppeal”.2  [4] Nothingraised bythe applicant meets the test under s 14.

IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW ZEALAND  SC 22/2015 [2015] NZSC 56   BETWEEN  MALCOM EDWARD RABSONAND RICHARD JOHN CRESER Applicants   AND  TRANSPARENCYINTERNATIONAL (NEW ZEALAND) INCORPORATED Respondent    Court: Glazebrook, Arnold and O'Regan JJ Counsel: Applicants in person D R Kalderimis and K E Yesberg for the Respondent Judgment: 8 May 2015  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B Costs of $2,500 are payable to the respondent.    REASONS  [1] The applicants seek leave to appeal against a High Court judgment of Mallon J dated 3 March 2015.1 In that judgment, Mallon J struck out the applicants’ statement of claim seeking judicial review of various decisions of Transparency International (New Zealand) Inc.  [2] Under s 14 ofthe Supreme Court Act 2003, the Supreme Court mustnot give leave to appeal directly to it against a decision made in a court other than the Court of Appeal unless (in addition to being satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of  Rabson v Transparency International (New Zealand) Inc [2015] NZHC 334.  MALCOM EDWARD RABSONAND RICHARD JOHN CRESER vTRANSPARENCYINTERNATIONAL (NEWZEALAND) INCORPORATED [2015] NZSC 56[8May2015]  justice for the Court to hear and determine the proposed appeal) it is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances justifying taking the proposed appeal directly to this Court.  [3] The applicants argue that the underlying appeal is of significant public importance and that the exceptional circumstances for a direct appeal are reinforced by “an oppressive security for costs regime” which will prevent the applicants appealingagainst the judgment to the New Zealand Court ofAppeal.   [4] The fact an appeal may be of public importance is not an exceptional circumstance justifying a direct appeal to this Court.2 As to security for costs, as this Court stated in Siemer v Brown, it “is not appropriate to allow a leapfrog appeal to this Court to circumvent the application of the rules applying to appeals to the Court ofAppeal, in particular, the requirement to pay securityfor costs”.3  [5] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed and costs of $2,500 are payable to the respondent.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  CA225/2015 [2015] NZCA 150   BETWEEN CAROLE CHRISTINE BANKS Appellant  AND PORTS OFAUCKLAND LIMITED Respondent  Counsel: A RLongdill forAppellant JA Farmer QC and M R Crotty for Respondent  Judgment: 5 May 2015 at 10.30 am  JUDGMENT OFMILLER J (On Review of Registrar’s Decision)    Security for costs is waived.  REASONS  [1] The appellant has sought a review of the Registrar’s decision to refuse to waive securityfor costs on this appeal.  [2] I am satisfied that the application should be granted. I will state my reasons shortly. First, the appeal relates to proposals by the respondent to extend the Bledisloe wharf into the Waitemata Harbour. In the broadest sense it can be described as genuine public interest litigation, relating to the stewardship and governance of public assets and the impact of the extension on the harbour and its users.  [3] Second, this is not a case in which the respondent needs the protection of security.  It contends that the appellant has the means to pay costs.  [4] Third, it cannot be said that the appeal is without merit. I differ from the Registrar on this point. The merits are difficult to assess. It is true that there appear to have been good practical reasons to deny interim relief, and the respondent has veryrecentlyoffered a compromise which its shareholder, the Auckland Council, has accepted. But it still proposes to proceed with part of the work (known as the B2 extension). It appears that work is under way. Further, the substantive merits are relevant too, and the judgment under appeal does not engage them. It must be assumed, for present purposes, that the appeal has some merit.  [5] For these reasons security for costs is waived. The appellant should not take this as an indication that she will escape costs, should the appeal fail.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  [20 SC 6/2015 15] NZSC 52   BETWEEN VINCENT ROSS SIEMER Applicant   AND REGISTRAR OFTHE SUPRCOURT First Respondent  EME   MINISTRY OF JUSTICE Second Respondent    Court: Elias CJ, Glazebrook and O'Regan JJ Counsel: Applicant in person  H M Carrad for First and Second Respondents Judgment: 5 May 2015  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks recall of our judgment in relation to his application for leave to appeal.1  [2] The ground on which the application for recall is advanced is that the judgment “did not address the bona fide ground of appeal” in the application for leave. This refers to the statement in the application for leave that the order to which the application related prevented the applicant from pursuing his substantive appeal to the Court ofAppeal on a matter which he says was described as a matter of public interest bya Judge and a Deputy Registrar.  Vincent Ross Siemer v Registrar of the Supreme Court [2015] NZSC 39 [17April 2015].  VINCENTROSS SIEMER vREGISTRAR OF THE SUPREME COURT[2015] NZSC52[5May2015]  [3] We do not accept that the order had that effect. The applicant’s failure to meet the requirements of the Court ofAppeal (Civil) Rules 2005 was the reason that he could not pursue his appeal to the Court of Appeal.  [4] The application for recall is therefore dismissed.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondents.  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  [201 SC 29/2015 5] NZSC 51   BETWEEN  JANINE DAVINA SAX Applicant   AND  LUKE ANDREW SIMPRespondent  SON    Court: Glazebrook, Arnold and O'Regan JJ Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment: 5 May 2015  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] Ms Sax seeks leave to appeal against a minute of Cooper J1 declining her application for interim suppression of details of judgments in the District Court and High Court pending her appeal against a decision of Faire J of 11 March 2015.2 Cooper J also declined her application for an urgent hearing of the appeal.  [2] In his judgment, Faire J declined Ms Sax’s application for the anonymisation of a judgment of Heath J3 and for suppression of the reasons for judgment.  [3] Ms Sax submits (among other grounds) that Cooper J’s refusal of interim suppression pending appeal renders that appeal nugatory.  1 Sax v Simpson CA112/2015, 19 March 2015 (Minute of Cooper J). The respondent, by letter of  24April 2015, has indicated that he will take no stepsinrelation to this application. 2 Sax v Simpson [2015] NZHC 442. 3 Sax v Simpson [2014] NZHC 3235.  JANINE DAVINASAX vLUKE ANDREWSIMPSON[2015] NZSC 51[5May2015]  [4] Cooper J’s decision was made under s 61A(1) of the Judicature Act 1908.  Accordingly, the proper mechanism to challenge Cooper J’s decision was for Ms Sax to apply for a review of his decision by three judges of the Court of Appeal under s 61A(2) of the JudicatureAct.4  [5] It is not therefore in the interests of justice for this Court to hear the proposed appeal. This means that the application for leave to appeal to this Court must be dismissed.  [6] There is no order for costs as the respondent took no steps in opposing the application for leave to appeal.

In this weathertightness claim, the plaintiffs are the present owners of the property. The first defendants are the previous owners of the property. The second defendants were the plaintiffs’ solicitors on the purchase transaction.  [2] There is a deficiency in the agreement for sale and purchase executed by the plaintiffs and first defendants. The parties used the standard form Auckland District Law Society (Eighth Edition) agreement for sale and purchase of real estate. It normally contains ten printed pages. The present agreement contains eight of those  BRINSDON & ORS v COURTNEY & ORS [2015] NZHC 924 [5 May 2015]  pages, plus an additional page setting out some special conditions of sale. Missing are pages four and five of the standard form, containing cls 3.13 to 6.5 inclusive.   [3] It is now common ground that the agreement for sale and purchase should be rectified to reincorporate the two missing pages.   [4] Given consensus, I give judgment now in terms of the rectification cause of action.   [5] All other causes of action remain to be tried on 30 November 2015.

IN THE EMPLOYMENT COURT WELLINGTON [2015] NZEmpC 56 EMPC 312/2014  IN THE MATTER OF  a challenge to a determination of the   Employment Relations Authority   BETWEEN  DREAM HIGH LIMITED   Plaintiff    AND HYERIM JI Defendant  Hearing: (on the papers -minute dated 18 February 2015)  Judgment: 5 May 2015  JUDGMENT OF JUDGE A D FORD  [1] On 17 November 2014, the plaintiff’s “owner” and representative Mr Hee Sung Lee filed a de novo challenge to the whole of a determination of the Employment Relations Authority dated 22 October 2014.1 However the proceedings were never served on the defendant.  [2] The Registrar had several email exchanges with Mr Lee between November 2014 and February 2015 pointing out that it was his responsibility to arrange service of the proceedings on the defendant as soon as possible. In one email dated 30 January 2015, Mr Lee said that he was sure that he had sent a copy of the proceedings to the defendant but no affidavit of service or statement of defence has ever been filed. At that stage, Mr Lee informed the Court that he had returned to  Korea because of his father’s illness.  Ji v Dream High Ltd [2014] NZERA Wellington 107.  DREAM HIGH LIMITED v HYERIM JI NZEmpC WELLINGTON [2015] NZEmpC 56 [5 May 2015]  [3] On 11 February 2015, the Registrar advised that it did not appear to him that the statement of claim had ever been served.  [4] On 18 February 2015, I issued an unless order informing Mr Lee that unless the proceedings were served on the defendant before 20 March 2015 then his challenge would be struck out. That order was duly served on Mr Lee but there has been no response.  [5] In the circumstances, the proceeding is struck out. As the defendant has never been served, no order is made as to costs.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CRI-2013-004-4424 [2015] NZHC 898  THE QUEEN  V  JORDONIOANE  Hearing: 1 May 2015  Appearances: G Hughes for Crown No appearance by MN Pecotic for Prisoner  Sentence: 1 May 2015  FURTHER SENTENCING NOTES OF TOOGOOD J  R v IOANE [2015] NZHC 898 [I May 2015]  [1] Mr Ioane, on 20 November 2014, following your conviction on a charge of supplying pseudoephedrine; I imposed a sentence of four years' imprisonment. It was clear from what I said at the time of that sentencing that I had intended that the total effective end sentence to be imposed on you for that sentence and three other offences was one ofthree years six months' imprisonment.1  [2] When I came to sentence you on each of the individual counts I made a mistake and it is necessary to correct that, which I do in the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction that the Court has to correct any errors.  [3] The result is that the sentence of four years' imprisonment on the count of supplying pseudoephedrine is set aside. In its place, I now sentence you, with effect from 20 November 2014, to a term of three years and six months' imprisonment on that charge.  [4] I realise that bringing you here in these circumstances is disruptive for you in your daily routine and I am sorry about that. My thanks go to Mr Hughes and Ms Pecotic for their assistance in this matter. I particularly want to mention the management and staff of the Corrections Department at Spring Hill for their assistance in putting this matter right. I realise it has been inconvenient to them also. So I thank you all very much.  [5] Mr Ioane you may stand down.  ~~r:4J  ...................~-..........

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  AUCKLAND REGISTRY  CIV-2014-404-770 [2015] NZHC 905   BETWEEN  COLIN LOUIS SAYLES Appellant   AND  PATER JAMES ADAMS AND SUSAN MARGARET ADAMS Respondents   Hearing:  On the papers   Date:  1 May 2015    JUDGMENT AS TO COSTS OF THOMAS J  This judgment was delivered by me on 1 May 2015 at 5.30 pm pursuant to Rule 11.5 ofthe High Court Rules.  Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date: ...............................  SAYLES v ADAMS and ADAMS [2015] NZHC 905 [1 May 2015]  [1] By my decision dated 14 August 2014 I dismissed the appellant's appeal against the decision of the Weathertight Homes Tribunal.  [2] I have now had placed before me a memorandum of counsel for the respondents seeking an order as to costs. For some reason, although the memorandum was dated October 2014, it has only in the last two weeks been given tome.  [3] The respondents refer to paragraph 75 of my decision, wherein I state that there seemed to be no reason why costs should not follow the event on a 2B basis. I reserved leave for the matter to be brought back to my attention if there were any dispute on this.  [4] The respondents' memorandum notes that counsel have tried unsuccessfully to obtain agreement on the matter of costs but the appellant's solicitors cannot obtain instructions.  [5] The respondents seek costs on a 2B basis as set out in paragraph 3 in their memorandum.  [6] I note that no response has been received from the appellant who was on notice of my view that costs on a 2B basis were appropriate. I remain of that view and costs as sought by the respondents are awarded.   
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA442/2014 [2015] NZCA 138  BETWEEN  DOUGLAS WAYNE FRASER MCLEAN Appellant   AND  ROBERT RITCHIE MARSHALL Respondent   Court:  French, Miller and Cooper JJ   Counsel:  L A Andersen for Appellant Respondent in person   Judgment:  30 April 2015 at 11.00 am    (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application is granted.   B The appellant will have seven days after delivery of this judgment in which to take the necessary steps.  Costs of this application are reserved.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Miller J)  [1] The appellant moves for an extension of time for applying for a hearing date.  [2] The appellant was required to seek a hearing date and file the case on appeal by Monday, 8 December. He did so by DX mail sent on 4 December, but the application for allocation of a hearing date was not received in this Court until 10 December.  MCLEAN v MARSHALL CA442/2014 [2015] NZCA 138 [30 April 2015]  [3] The respondent opposes saying that the papers could have been delivered in time.  [4] The delay has been explained, it is very short, and the respondent has suffered no prejudice. The application is granted. The appellant will have seven days after delivery of this judgment in which to take the necessary steps. Costs of this application are reserved.

REASONS  [1] On 11 March 2015, this Court issued a decision dismissing Mrs Howard’s application for leave to appeal against a decision of Randerson J.1 The Judge had dismissed Mrs Howard’s application for a review of the decision of the Registrar of the Court ofAppeal in relation to securityfor costs.2 Mrs Howard now applies fora recall of this Court’s decision.  1 Howard v Accident Compensation Corporation [2015] NZSC 25. 2 Howard v Accident Compensation Corporation [2015] NZCA627.  MAREE HOWARD vACCIDENTCOMPENSATIONCORPORATION[2015] NZSC 48 [28April 2015]  [2] The basis on which courts will recall their judgments is limited.3 Mrs Howard has not raised anything which would justify a recall in this instance. In essence, she is simply attempting to relitigate matters, which is impermissible.   [3] Accordingly, we dismiss Mrs Howard’s application for recall. We make no order as to costs.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 15/2015   [2015] NZSC 46   BETWEEN  RAZDAN RAFIQ   Applicant   AND  THE COMMISSIONER OF   NEW ZEALAND POLICE   Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, Arnold and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person   N M HWhittington and O M Klaassen for Respondent   Judgment:  23 April 2015    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant must pay the respondent costs of $2,500.    REASONS  [1] On 22 July 2014 the applicant, Mr Rafiq, applied to the High Court for leave to commence a defamation proceeding against the Commissioner of Police out of time. Mr Rafiq required leavebecause the allegedlydefamatorystatement was made in an email sent by a police officer to an employee of the Department of Internal Affairs on 10 March 2008, outside the period in s 4 of the Limitation Act 1950, although there was also reference to a further statement made in a brief of evidence of 10 February 2012 filed with the Human Rights Review Tribunal. In his amended draft statement of claim, Mr Rafiq sought a declaration that the respondent is liable to him in defamation, compensatory damages of $50 million, aggravated damages of $20 million and exemplary damages of $10 million.   RAZDAN RAFIQ vTHE COMMISSIONER OF NEW ZEALANDPOLICE [2015] NZSC 46[23April 2015]  [2] Andrews J doubted that the Court had jurisdiction to grant leave given that Mr Rafiq had not applied within six years of the March 2008 statement being made, but went on to consider the merits, particularly given the reference to the February 2012 brief.  The Judge refused leave.1  [3] Mr Rafiq filed an appeal against Andrews J’s decision. The Registrar of the Court of Appeal fixed security for costs at $5,880.00. Mr Rafiq sought a review of her decision by a Judge of the Court of Appeal. Harrison J dismissed Mr Rafiq’s application for review.2 MrRafiq now seeks leave to appeal to this Court.  [4] This Court has set out the proper approach to security for costs in Reekie v Attorney-General.3 Accordingly, the proposed appeal does not involve any issue of general or public importance but rather involves simply the application of a settled approach to particular facts. Moreover, there is nothing to indicate that a substantial miscarriage of justice may have occurred. In these circumstances, leave must be declined.  [5] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed. The applicant must pay the respondent costs of $2,500.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA110/2015 [2015] NZCA 125  BETWEEN  HARLEYTRIDENT RICHMOND Appellant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Counsel:  Appellant in Person G AKelly for Respondent   Judgment:  21April 2015 at 9:30 am    (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF RANDERSON J  The application for bail is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The appellant pleaded guilty in the District Court to one count of rape. He was subsequently sentenced to seven and a half years imprisonment.1 He now appeals solely against his conviction and seeks bail pending appeal under s 55 of the Bail Act 2000. The application is opposed by the Crown. I have considered the application under s 393(2)(d) of the CrimesAct 1961.   [2] The grounds for the bail application are that the appellant has a number of children one of whom is unwell and requires weekly admission to Waikato Hospital. The appellant also refers to difficulties for his family who are being cared for by the appellant’s partner and mother of the children.   R v Richmond DCHamiltonCRI-2013-019-1815,17 November 2014.  RICHMOND vR CA110/2015 [2015] NZCA125[21April2015]  [3] Section 14 of the Bail Act creates a presumption against the granting of bail pending appeal.2 The onus is on the appellant to demonstrate that on the balance of probabilities it is in the interests of justice that bail be granted.3 Bail pending appeal is unusual and only to be granted in exceptional circumstances.4  [4] Section 14(3) of the Bail Act sets out a range of considerations affecting applications for bail pending appeal. I am not satisfied that the appellant has demonstrated that it is in the interests of justice that bail be granted. The grounds of appeal do not appear to be strong given the appellant’s plea of guiltyand the fact that he was represented by legal counsel at the time the plea was entered; the sentence is relatively lengthy and a hearing date within the next two to three months is likely; while sympathetic to the appellant’s family circumstances, they are little different from those of the families of many offenders in similar positions.  [5] Accordingly, the application for bail pending appeal is dismissed.

B  The questions of law for determination by this Court are:   1. Did the Employment Court err in its judgment at [47]–[49] in its interpretation of s 200 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 in holding that, where an order forbidding publication of information has been made, it is not a “publication” to make disclosure of that information to that person’s employer where the employer has a genuine interest in that information?    ASG V HAYNE, VICE-CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OTAGO CA703/2014 [2015] NZCA 115 [15 April 2015]  2.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 129/2014   [2015] NZSC 30   BETWEEN  ISSAC JOHN CHADDERTON   Applicant   AND  NEW ZEALAND POLICE   Respondent   Court:  William Young, Arnold and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  A G Speed and D H P Schellenberg forApplicant   P D Marshall for Respondent   Judgment:  31 March 2015    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a judgment of the Court of Appeal,1 rejecting his appeal from a decision of the High Court2 upholding a conviction entered against him in the District Court3 for driving with an excess proportion of alcohol in his blood.  [2] In issue are two periods of delay which occurred between the applicant failing a breath screening test and him arriving at the police station where the evidential breath test was administered. The first delay was of five to 10 minutes while one of the two attending police officers completed the taking of a statement from a witness. The second, of approximately 30 minutes, was when the two police  1 Chadderton v R [2014] NZCA528. 2 Chadderton v Police [2013] NZHC 2672. 3 Police v Chadderton DCAuckland CRI-2011-044-1152,3April 2013.  ISSAC JOHN CHADDERTON v NEWZEALANDPOLICE [2015] NZSC 30[31 March2015]  officers stopped to attend to a van which had broken down just before an on-ramp to a motorway creating a situation which they considered to be a risk to road safety.  [3] The Court of Appeal held that there was no breach of s 69 of the Land Transport Act 1998 and, as well, that on the facts of the case, the applicant was not unreasonably detained in breach of s 22 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act.  [4] The proposed grounds of appeal are that (a) the Court of Appeal did not follow Birchler v Police4 and (b) that the Court of Appeal’s conclusion as to the lawfulness of the applicant’s detention was wrong.  [5] The facts of the present case differ substantially from those of Birchler (in which a required procedural step had not occurred at all). And in any event, on the findings of the Court of Appeal on the lawfulness of the detention, there was no deviation from the process required under the statute. The issue whether the delays rendered the detention of the applicant unlawful is very factual and does not raise a question of law of public or general importance. As well, there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent  Birchler v Police [2010] NZSC 109, [2011] 1 NZLR 169.  
NOTE: THE ORDER MADE BY THE HIGH COURT ON 28 MAY 2012 PROHIBITING PUBLICATION OF THE PARTIES' NAMES AND ANY PARTICULARS THAT WOULD IDENTIFY THE RESPONDENT (INCLUDING HER NAME, OCCUPATION, EMPLOYMENT HISTORY AND HEALTH) REMAINS IN FORCE PENDING FURTHER ORDER OF THE HIGH COURT.  IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW ZEALAND  SC 78/2014 [2015] NZSC 31   BETWEEN  LFDB Appellant   AND  SM Respondent   Hearing:  5 December 2014    Court: Elias CJ, McGrath, William Young, Glazebrook and Arnold JJ Counsel: M S Smith forAppellant P B Friedlander for Respondent Judgment: 31 March 2015  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The appellant must pay costs of $52,245.63 and disbursements of $1,511.12 in respect of the appeal.  B The appellant must also pay in addition to costs previously ordered, disbursements of $437.30 in respect of the stay application determined by the Court.1  REASONS  [1] The Court revoked its grant of leave to appeal in this matter on 5 December 2014 giving reasons on 22 December 2014.2 Costs werereserved.  LFDB v SM [2014] NZSC 168.  LFDB vSM [2015] NZSC 31[31March 2015]  [2] The respondent has applied for costs to be fixed on an indemnity basis. The schedule to counsel’s memorandum lists items totalling $52,245.63 for costs and $1,511.12 for disbursements.3 The respondent has also applied for an order that the appellant pay disbursements of $437.30 on the earlier stay application to this Court.  [3] There is no issue as to the reasonableness of any of the amounts claimed, but the appellant seeks a reduction in the costs award to recognise when leave to appeal was granted he had identified issues which the Court had accepted warranted a grant of leave. We do not accept that submission. The Court revoked leave having come to the conclusion that the appeal was an abuse of process. In those circumstances we are satisfied that an award of full indemnity costs, and disbursements, as set out above, is appropriate, as is an order in relation to the disbursements on the stay application.  [4] The respondent also sought ancillary orders as to dates by which payment of costs was to be made and for payment to be made out of identified bank accounts.  We do not consider such orders appropriate.

Both proceedings are brought by the executor of the estate of Mr Sheehan.  [2] The application for summary judgment has been served. The application that the notice of claim be removed has not.   [3] The defendant has taken no steps in response to the application for summary judgment.   [4] I am satisfied on the basis of the affidavit evidence before the Court there is no reasonably arguable defence to the application for summary judgment for possession and damages calculated as rental for wrongful possession.  [5] Accordingly, there will be judgment for the plaintiff as follows:  (a)  an order that the defendant deliver up possession of the property described in the statement of claim;   (b)  reserving leave to seek any further consequential orders that may be necessary;   (c)  an order for damages and related relief for lost rental from the date of issue of the proceedings to judgment in the sum of $3,960.    [6] Costs to the plaintiff on a 2B basis of $8,159 together with disbursements of $1,630.  [7] The application that the notice of claim be removed is adjourned for call in the list on 21 April 2015. In making the above orders the defendant has a right to pursue any related claim arising out of any relationship with the deceased in the Court in the usual way.   Venning J

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV 2015-485-188 [2015] NZHC 543  BETWEEN IAG NEW ZEALAND LIMITED Applicant  AND  GET A LIFE LIMITED   Respondent   Hearing:  23 March 2015   Counsel:  B R D Cuff for Applicant   Judgment:  24 March 2015    JUDGMENT OF BROWN J  [1] This is an application for the appointment of a receiver to the property owned by the respondent, Get A Life Ltd, made under r 7.59 of the High Court Rules. The application was served on the company at its registered office and on Mr Christopher Groves on 5 March 2015. An affidavit of service verifying the service has been filed. No steps have been taken by Get A Life Ltd. However at the hearing Mr M A F Gilkison advised the Court that, while he had no instructions to make an appearance for Get A Life Ltd, he was present to observe proceedings on the  company’s part.  [2] Application is first made for leave to bring this application by an originating application. Leave is granted under r 19.5 of the High Court Rules to commence the proceeding in that manner.  IAG NZ LTD v GET A LIFE LTD [2015] NZHC 543 [24 March 2015]  [3] I have read the affidavit of Mr R M van Geet in support of the application. I understand that bankruptcy proceedings are in the course of progress against Mr Groves and at least in the first instance the objective of the application for the appointment of a receiver is to ensure that the assets of Mr Groves, in particular his shareholding in the respondent, are not dissipated pending the completion of the bankruptcy proceedings.  [4] Consequently under r 7.59 I appoint the Official Assignee as receiver to all  the property owned by the respondent for the purpose of preserving the respondent’s  assets pending the completion of the bankruptcy proceedings against Mr Groves.  Once the outcome of those proceedings are known the first applicant and the receiver are to bring the matter back before the Court for further directions in the receivership.   [5] The first applicant at this time seeks no further direction for steps to be taken by the receiver save for the action of preserving the assets of the respondent pending the completion of the insolvency proceeding.  [6] Costs of the application are reserved for determination in the context of any final orders.  Brown J

PUBLICATION IN LAW REPORT OR LAW DIGEST PERMITTED.  IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA852/2012 [2015] NZCA 79  BETWEEN  MARTIN VICTOR LYTTELTON Appellant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Court:  Miller, Heath and Clifford JJ   Counsel:  Appellant in person M J Lillico for Respondent   Judgment:  23 March 2015 at 11.30 am    (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for an order lifting the prohibition on publication in our judgment of 19 December 2014 is dismissed.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given byMiller J)  [1] This judgment addresses Mr Lyttelton’s application for an order lifting suppression pending retrial.  [2] Mr Lyttelton has sought this order, saying that it is necessary for fair trial reasons that the judgment and any part of the proceedings be published in the news media or on the internet or on other publicly available database, so allowing fair news reporting of both the fact of the first trial and the fact of the retrial, as well as this Court’s reasons. He says that it will allow him to openly discuss the appeal and the reasons for the retrial with members of the public with whom he will be dealing when preparing for the retrial.  [3] The Crown opposes the application, pointing out that the order does not preclude Mr Lyttelton talking to potential witnesses or friends or family and noting that his name is not suppressed.  [4] We decline the application. We do not accept that it is necessary for fair trial reasons. The order of this kind is orthodox having regard to the content of our judgment, which, as the Crown submits, reviews the respective theories of the case and their relative merits.

In that minute costs were reserved to be dealt with by way of memoranda.  Counsel have now exchanged memoranda.   [2] In his memorandum of 25 February counsel for the first respondent sought costs on a 2B basis calculated at $4,488 includingdisbursements of $110.  [3] Counsel forthe applicants does not opposecostsbeingfixed on that basisand in that sum.  [4] In a second memorandum filed on behalf of counsel for the second respondent, counsel refers to a direction sought at paragraph 2(c) of an earlier memorandum in which the applicants and second respondent agreed any issue as to costs in the caveat proceeding should be dealt with as part of the substantive proceedings.  Orders were made accordingly.  [5] In the circumstances costs in relation to these caveat proceedings as between the applicants and second respondent are to be dealt with in the context of the costs order in the substantive proceedings.     Result  [6] The first respondent is to have costs against the applicant in the sum of $4,488.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY  CIV-2015-404-000448   [2015] NZHC 495   BETWEEN  ASB BANK LIMITED   Applicant   AND  ZHEN ZHENG   Respondent   Hearing:  17 March 2015    Appearances: N Maday for Applicant Judgment: 17 March 2015  ORAL JUDGMENT OF VENNING J  Solicitors: MinterEllisonRuddWatts,Auckland  ASB BANK LTD v ZHENG[2015] NZHC 495[17 March2015]  [1] This is an application for an order that a caveat be removed.  [2] The applicant Bank holds a first ranking mortgage registered on 19 January 2013 over the relevant property. The mortgage secures money and obligations owed by the registered proprietor. The respondent lodged a caveat on the title to the property on 17 September 2013 after the registration of the applicant’s mortgage.  The caveat claims an interest as beneficiary pursuant to a constructive trust based on contributions towards the purchase of the property. The registered proprietor’s account with the Bank is in default. The Bank has issued a notice of default and moved to mortgagee sale. Settlement of the mortgaged property was scheduled for 11 March 2015.  A caveat prevents registration of the settlement documentation.   [3] As a prior ranking interest the mortgage takes priority over the caveat.  Further, it is proposed that in the event there is a surplus of funds after the sale of the mortgaged property and repayment of costs of sale and satisfaction of the Bank’s mortgage, the surplus will be paid into the trust account of the Bank’s solicitors and held and only released pending agreement between the respondent and the proprietor or orders of this Court.  [4] I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make the orders sought. Any proper interest the caveator has is addressed by the orders sought. Accordingly, there will be orders in accordance with the application before the Court in terms of 1(a) and (b).  [5] Costs to the applicant in the sum of $4,776.00 together with disbursements of $664.75.  Venning J

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2015-485-194 [2015] NZHC 461  IN THE ESTATE OF JOSEPH ROONEY of Waikanae, New Zealand, Deceased  In Chambers: On papers Judgment: 13 March 2015   JUDGMENT OF THE HON JUSTICE KÓS  [1] Mr Joseph Rooney died at Waikanae on 28 May 2014. He had made a valid will in March 1994. He tried to make a new will on 25 September 2009. But that document is signed by one witness only. So it is not a valid will.1 He tried to modify that September 2009 instrument by purported codicils dated 24 February 2012 and 17 January 2014. The first was not witnessed at all. The latter was witnessed but, as with the purported will, by one witness only. So none of the three instruments are valid.  [2] Mr Nathan Rooney, the deceased’s grandson and the executor named in the September 2009 instrument, applies for orders that the three instruments be declared the valid will and codicils of Mr Joseph Rooney.  [3] The beneficiaries under the 1994 will are Mr Joseph Rooney’s three children, Michael, Kieron and Jeanette. They are also the beneficiaries under the 2009  Wills Act 2007, s 11.  RE: JOSEPH ROONEY [2015] NZHC 461 [13 March 2015]  instrument. The variations between the two instruments are relatively modest. Michael, Kieron and Jeanette all support the present application. All those with interests under the 1994 will and the 2009 instrument consent to the orders sought.  [4] In terms of s 14:  (a)  the instruments indeed appear to be intended as a will and two codicils;   (b)  they do not comply with s 11 of the Wills Act 2007;   (c)  they came into existence in New Zealand; and   (d)  I am satisfied, on the face of the instruments and the evidence of Mr Nathan Rooney, that they express the testamentary intentions of Mr Joseph Rooney.    [5] Accordingly I make orders declaring:  (a)  Exhibit A to the affidavit of Mr Nathan Rooney dated 4 March 2015 to be the valid will of Mr Joseph Rooney;   (b)  Exhibit B to the same affidavit to be a valid first codicil to that will; and   (c)  Exhibit C to the same affidavit to be a valid second codicil to that will.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  [2015] NZSC 21   BETWEEN  VINCENT ROSS SIEMER Applicant   AND  REGISTRAR OFTHE SUPREME COURT First Respondent   MINISTRY OF JUSTICE Second Respondent    Court: Elias CJ, William Young, Glazebrook,Arnold and O'Regan JJ Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment: 11 March 2015  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for review is dismissed.  REASONS  Background  [1] On 27 January 2015, Mr Siemer attempted to file in this Court an application for leave to appeal against a decision of the Deputy Registrar of the Court ofAppeal refusing to accept for filing certain applications made by Mr Siemer.   [2] On 28 January2015, the Registrar of this Court refused to accept MrSiemer’s application for leave to appeal against the Deputy Registrar’s decision for want of jurisdiction.  VINCENTROSS SIEMER vREGISTRAR OF THE SUPREME COURT[2015] NZSC21[11 March 2015]  [3] On 10 February 2015, Glazebrook J dismissed Mr Siemer’s application, under s 28(2) of the Supreme Court Act 2003, for a review of the Registrar’s decision. This was on the basis that this Court had no jurisdiction to hear the proposed appeal.1  [4] On 12 February 2015, Mr Siemer applied, under s 28(3) of the Supreme Court Act, for a review of Glazebrook J’s decision.   Decision  [5] It is doubtful whether s 28 (2) and (3) reviews are available in circumstances where an applicant does not have a substantive proceeding before this Court.2  [6] However, even assuming a s 28(3) application for review is available in the present circumstances, the application must be dismissed. Glazebrook J was correct to uphold the Registrar’s decision not to accept Mr Siemer’s application for filing on the basis of lack of jurisdiction.3  1 Siemer v Registrar of the Supreme Court [2015] NZSC 1 at [5] and [6]. We comment that there are doubts whether, in refusing to accept an application for filing, the Registrar is acting under a power conferred bya rule of Court and therefore whether s 28(2) was applicable.  2 See Howard v Accident Compensation Corporation [2014] NZSC 31, (2014) 21 PRNZ 815 at  [3] and Siemer v Stiassny [2014] NZSC 70 at n3.  3 Glazebrook J has participated in the review of her decision under s 28(3) on the basis of Howard v Accident Compensation Corporation [2014] NZSC 31, (2014) 21 PRNZ 815 at [3] and Siemer v Stiassny [2014] NZSC 80 at [6].  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 5/2015 [2015] NZSC 25   BETWEEN  MAREE HOWARD Applicant   AND  ACCIDENT COMPENSATION CORPORATION Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, Glazebrook and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person PAMcBride for Respondent   Judgment:  11 March 2015    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent, plus reasonable disbursements.    REASONS  [1] The applicant, Mrs Howard, has been involved in long-running, but from her perspective unsuccessful, litigation with the respondent, the Accident Compensation Corporation. The litigation arises out of the suspension of her ACC entitlements following her refusal to undertake an assessment as required bya notice issued under s 72 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001. When she issued judicial review proceedings seeking to set aside the s 72 notice, the ACC applied to strike out the proceedings on the basis that Mrs Howard had challenged the s 72 notice and its effect on her entitlements in previous litigation, which had been finally determined againsther.  TheACCcontended thatjudicial review proceedings were, therefore, an attempt to mount a collateral attack on earlier unfavourable court decisions and should be struck out as an abuse of process.  MAREE HOWARD vACCIDENTCOMPENSATIONCORPORATION[2015] NZSC 25 [11 March 2015]  [2] In the High Court, Clifford J accepted the ACC’s arguments and struck out Mrs Howard’s application for judicial review.1 Mrs Howard appealed. The Registrar of the Court of Appeal fixed security for costs at $5,880. When the Registrar refused her application to have the payment of security dispensed with or deferred, Mrs Howard applied for a review of the Registrar’s decision by a Judge.  Randerson J refused her application.2 Mrs Howard now seeks leave to appeal against that decision.   [3] Mrs Howard submits that important constitutional issues in relation to access to justice are involved. Among other things, she contends that in its decision in Reekie v Attorney-General,3 this Court overlooked the implications of the Magna Carta.  [4] In Reekie, the Court determined the principles applicable to securityfor costs.  In doing so, it recognised (through the notion of the reasonable and solvent litigant) that impecuniosity should not stand in the way of an arguable appeal. In the present case, Randerson J applied the approach set out in Reekie, concluding that Mrs Howard’s appeal had little merit. Mrs Howard has not raised anything which satisfies us that Randerson J’s conclusion is arguably wrong.  [5] It follows that we are not satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice that we hear and determine Mrs Howard’s proposed appeal. No point of principle is involved and we see no risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.  [6] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed. Mrs Howard must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent, plus reasonable disbursements.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 130/2014 [2015] NZSC 23   BETWEEN  VINCENT ROSS SIEMER Applicant   AND  CLARE O'BRIEN First Respondent   ATTORNEY-GENERAL Second Respondent   Court:  Glazebrook, Arnold and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person D L Harris for First and Second Respondents   Judgment:  10 March 2015    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] Mr Siemer asks the Court to recall its judgment in Siemer v O’Brien,1 in which the Court rejected Mr Siemer’s application to appeal directly to this Court from a decision of the High Court.2 The essential basis of the recall application is that the Court did not properly understand the basis for the leave application.  [2] Contrary to Mr Siemer’s assertions, the Court did understand that his intended appeal sought to challenge the role of the Attorney-General in the proceedings and addressed that point to the extent necessary.   1 Siemer v O’Brien [2015] NZSC 13. 2 Siemer v O’Brien [2015] NZHC 2886.  VINCENTROSS SIEMER vCLARE O'BRIEN [2015] NZSC23 [10 March 2015]  [3] More fundamentally, as the Court noted in its earlier judgment, where an applicant seeks to appeal directly to this Court, by-passing the Court of Appeal, the applicant must, by virtue of s 14 of the Supreme Court Act 2003, establish that there are exceptional circumstances justifying that course. The only explanation MrSiemer gave for his leave application was to avoid the “oppressive” security for costs regime in the Court of Appeal. Obviously, that cannot qualify as an exceptional circumstance, so that his application for leave to appeal could not succeed in any event.  [4] The application for recall is dismissed.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 104/2014 [2015] NZSC 19   BETWEEN  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON Applicant   AND  REGISTRAR OFTHE SUPREME COURT First Respondent   MINISTRY OF JUSTICE Second Respondent   Court:  William Young, Arnold and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person K Laurenson for Respondents   Judgment:  9 March 2015    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The recall application is dismissed.   REASONS  [1] The applicant’s application for leave to appeal against a judgment of French J1 was dismissed in a judgment of this Court delivered on 2 December 2014.2 In a judgment delivered on 23 December 2014, an application for recall of that judgment and a second application for leave to appeal against the same judgment of French J were also dismissed.3 The applicant has now sought a recall of the 23 December judgment.  1 Rabson v Registrar of the Supreme Court [2014] NZCA481. 2 Rabson v Registrar of the Supreme Court [2014] NZSC 175 [2 December judgment]. 3 Rabson v Registrar of the Supreme Court [2014] NZSC 191 [23 December judgment]  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON v REGISTRAR OF THE SUPREME COURT[2015] NZSC19[9 March 2015]  [2] This is a second application in relation to the judgment of 2 December and the applicant has raised nothing which warrants its recall or the recall of the 23 December judgment to the extent that it denied recall of the earlier judgment.  [3] The second application for leave was primarily addressed4 to the question whether the applicant had a right of review under s 61A(2) of the Judicature Act 1908 in respect of the judgment of French J, a proposition which was rejected in the 23 December judgment.5 That judgment did not expressly refer to judgment of French J as having been made under s 61A(3) but that this was the case was made clear byreference in the judgment to Reekie v Attorney-General.6 That French J was acting under s 61A(3) is apparent in the judgment she gave (which refers to r 7(2) of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 20057 and is described as being a review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision).8 Contrary to the contention of the applicant, the Court was not mistaken as to the exercise carried out by French J (which is accurately described in the both the original leave judgment of 2 December and more succinctly in the first recall judgment of 23 December).  And as explained in the 23 December judgment the reference to payment of security for costs was not in the nature of an order but rather an explanation of the position which resulted from the orders which French J had made.  [4] Accordingly the second application for recall is dismissed.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondents  4 There are other complaints: that the issue whether there was a s 61A(2) review was not before the Court and that a separate file had not been created for the second application for leave. The first complaint is wrong as the applicant’s major concern was that the Court of Appeal was not according him what he mistakenly thought was his right to a s 61A(2) review. The second complaint is inconsequential.  5 23 December judgment, above n 3, at [3].  6 Reekie v Attorney-General [2014] NZSC 63, [2014]1 NZLR 737 at [24]–[26].  7 At [3].  8 2 December judgment, above n 2, at [1].
