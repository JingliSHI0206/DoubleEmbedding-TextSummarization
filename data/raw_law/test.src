IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA36/2014 [2015] NZCA 47  BETWEEN JASON ROBERT OGLE-GRAY Appellant AND THE QUEEN Respondent Hearing: 4 March 2015 Court: Harrison, Fogarty and Dobson JJ Counsel: No appearance for Appellant J E Mildenhall for Crown Judgment: 6 March 2015 at 10 am   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The appeal is dismissed.   REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Fogarty J)  [1] The appeal was set down for hearing and was called on 4 March. There was no appearance for Mr Ogle-Gray. He has not taken any steps to pursue his appeal since 9 July 2014 and has consistently failed since then to comply with judicial directions.  [2] This was an appeal both on conviction and sentence. Mr Ogle-Gray had been found guilty after a trial of all 22 counts of knowingly filing false GST returns. He was convicted and sentenced to four months home detention and 400 hours  OGLE-GRAY V R CA36/2014 [2015] NZCA 47 [6 March 2015]  community work, with provision for basic work and living skills.1 There was an order for reparation of $5,000.2 The outstanding loss was more.  [3] We are not satisfied that the appeal has any merit and, in the absence of any argument in support, it is dismissed.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 69/2014 [2015] NZSC 18   BETWEEN  MARGOT CREQUER Applicant   AND  CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFTHE MINISTRY OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, William Young and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person D L Harris for Respondent   Judgment:  6 March 2015    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks a recall of the judgment of this Court of 2 September 20141 dismissing her application for leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of 30 June 2014.2 The application for leave to appeal involved interlocutory issues as to an appeal to the High Court and thus fell to be considered under s 13(4) of the Supreme Court Act 2003. At the heart of the issues which the applicant wished to raise in this Court were (a) a procedural ruling the substance of which can be reviewed at the hearing of the appeal in the High Court and (b) an order for costs  1 Crequer v Chief Executive of the Ministry of Social Development [2014] NZSC 119 [Crequer (SC)].  2 Crequer v Chief Executive of the Ministry of Social Development [2014] NZCA 284 (Harrison, Stevens and Miller JJ).  MARGOTCREQUER v CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFTHE MINISTRYOF SOCIALDEVELOPMENT[2015] NZSC 18 [6 March 2015]  made by the Court of Appeal which the respondent has undertaken not to enforce. The judgment proceeded on the basis that the s 13(4) test was not met.3  [2] The applicant’s submissions in support of the current application, while challenging the reasoning of the Court, raise nothing that warrants a recall of the 2 September 2014 judgment.

B The appeal against conviction is dismissed.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Dobson J)  [1] This application for leave to appeal on a question of law and appeal against conviction following a plea of guilty were set down for hearing and were called on 2 March 2015.  There was no appearance for Mr Tenakore.   [2] This Court had previously given the Public Defence Service leave to withdraw as counsel for Mr Tenakore, in reliance on their inability to obtain instructions.  We are satisfied that Mr Tenakore had notice of the fixture.  TENAKORE V R CA426/2014 [2015] NZCA 44 [5 March 2015]  [3] We are not satisfied that the application for leave to appeal or the appeal against conviction have any merit and both are dismissed accordingly.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors: DLA Phillips Fox, Wellington for Plaintiffs Luke Cunningham and Clere, Wellington for Defendants  OKKERSE v AOTEAROA ENTERPRISES LIMITED [2015] NZHC 342 [3 March 2015]  [1] Having read and considered the submissions of counsel for the plaintiffs and defendants, the following costs orders are made:  (i)  Costs are awarded in favour of the defendants on a 2B basis in the sum of $37,014.   (ii)  It is appropriate in the circumstances of the case for an order for increased costs to be made, which is justified as 100 per cent. This has the effect of increasing the award of costs to a total sum of $74,028. In my view this approach reflects fairly upon the situation of all parties.    (iii) The sum of $41,806 due to the plaintiffs is a separate matter which should not form part of the present costs order.   Result  [2] There will be an award of costs of in favour of the defendants in the total sum of $74,028.  Goddard J  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2013-485-9686 [2015] NZHC 335  BETWEEN  COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE Appellant   AND  JOHN CURTIS DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED Respondent    In Chambers: On papers Judgment: 3 March 2015  JUDGMENT OF THE HON JUSTICE KÓS (Costs)  [1] The taxpayer persuaded the Taxation Review Authority that development payments received from the purchaser of its retail shopping centre were capital sums, and not taxable. Before me, however, the Commissioner succeeded in its appeal.1 I held that the payments were revenue, and therefore taxable.  [2] Now the question of costs falls to be determined. The Commissioner seeks costs of $14,527, and disbursements of $1,207.26, based on scale 2B. There is no argument about the calculation. But the unsuccessful taxpayer says that costs should lie where they fall here. That is because this is an appeal from an Authority which has a no costs rule, and the parties had mixed results before me (the appellant’s appeal on shortfall penalties having failed).   1 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v John Curtis Developments Ltd [2014] NZHC 3034, 28 November 2014.  COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE v JOHN CURTIS DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED [2015] NZHC 335 [3 March 2015]  [3] In Auckland Gas Co Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue2 the Court of Appeal said:3  It is difficult to justify drawing on a no-costs rule, for what in most Taxation Review Authority cases are relatively small-sum tax disputes, in determining the proper approach to costs in the dozen or so first instance cases heard in the High Court each year where inevitably the stakes tend to be much higher.  [4] Although that case was not an appeal from the Authority, I see no principled basis for extending the no costs regime in the Authority to appeals in this Court. No statutory or judicial authority in support of that approach was cited. Neither necessary implication nor substantial procedural policy reasons command such variation from orthodoxy. Had the Commissioner failed before me, the taxpayer would have been the first to have sought costs. And it would then have deserved them.  [5] In this case the appeal succeeded, and costs should follow the event in the ordinary way in this Court. Although the Commissioner failed on the shortfall penalties argument, that was very much a secondary issue in the case. Little time was spent on it.  Result  [6] The Commissioner will have costs of $14,527, together with disbursements of $1,207.26.

         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  INVERCARGILL REGISTRY    CRI 2014-425-53  [2015] NZHC 331       BETWEEN     DAVID RICHARD PARKER  Appellant      AND     NEW ZEALAND POLICE  Respondent       Hearing:     2 March 2015      Counsel:     Appellant in Person  M J Thomas for Respondent      Judgment:     3 March 2015         JUDGMENT OF BROWN J     [1] On 11 December 2014 the appellant was found guilty of an offence against s 11(1)(a), Summary Offences Act 1981 that he intentionally damaged a window the property of the New Zealand Police.    [2] When this matter was called Ms Thomas advised that, having given further consideration to the circumstances relating to the charge, she had a concern that the door of the prison cell should not have been capable of being broken in response to the kicks which the appellant had applied to it.  In those circumstances she considered that, had the appellant been legally represented, greater attention would have been focused on the issue whether intention or recklessness could have been established in those circumstances.   [3] Consequently, and very responsibly, Ms Thomas indicated that the Crown would not present opposition to the appeal.    [4] In view of this development, Mr Parker’s appeal is allowed.  His conviction on the charge of wilful damage is quashed and the fine, order for reparation and Court costs, are all set aside.      ________________________  Brown J    Solicitors:  Preston Russell Law, Invercargill    
         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  INVERCARGILL REGISTRY    CRI 2014-425-34  [2015] NZHC 333       BETWEEN     VINNY VINESH KUMAR RAM  Appellant      AND     NEW ZEALAND POLICE  Respondent       Hearing:     3 March 2015      Counsel:     H Cuthill for Appellant  M J Thomas for Respondent      Judgment:     3 March 2015         JUDGMENT OF BROWN J     [1] On 19 August 2014 the appellant pleaded guilty in the Invercargill District Court to three charges:   (a) driving with excess blood alcohol content;   (b) wilful trespass;   (c) criminal harassment.    [2] On 29 September 2014 the appellant was sentenced to one and a half months imprisonment on the first and second charges and to six months imprisonment on the harassment charge, all sentences being cumulative.   [3] He appeals against conviction on the charge of criminal harassment and against the total sentence of nine months imprisonment for all three charges.  Those appeals were to be heard today.    [4] The ground of appeal in respect of his conviction on the charge of criminal harassment is that he received incompetent legal advice, that as a consequence he did not properly appreciate the nature of the charge or that he had a possible defence to the charge, and that a miscarriage of justice will occur if the conviction is not overturned.   [5] Affidavit evidence has been filed by the appellant and by two solicitors who represented him concerning the content of the legal advice which the appellant received.   [6] In the light of that affidavit evidence counsel for the respondent filed a memorandum dated 2 March 2015 which states that given the multiplicity of alleged issues with representation, the gravity of the overall criminality, and the risk to the appearance of fair trial rights, it is appropriate that the appellant be able to advance his purported defence to the charge of criminal harassment.   [7] In the Crown’s submission the irregularity complained of has created a “real risk that the outcome of the [matter] was affected”1 and that the appropriate step is to quash the conviction and refer the matter back to the District Court for a new trial.   [8] In view of the Crown’s submission I order that the conviction on the charge of criminal harassment is set aside pursuant to s 233(2) and a new trial be held pursuant to s 233(3)(b).   [9] Given that the sentence appeal relates to the total sentence for all three charges, that appeal is adjourned part heard pending the new trial on the charge of criminal harassment.  Ms Cuthill agrees that that course is appropriate.    1  Criminal Procedure Act 2011, s 232(4)(a).    ___________________________  Brown J  Solicitors:   Cruickshank Pryde, Invercargill  Preston Russell Law, Invercargill

I directed that a memorandum seeking costs was to be filed by 5 February 2015 and any memorandum in response by the defendants was to be filed by 19 February 2015.

[3] The principles applicable to dispensing with security for costs in the Court of Appeal were addressed by this Court in Reekie v Attorney-General.3 Harrison J’s approach is generally consistent with those principles.4 There is no departure that raises any new issue of general or public importance.

B Costs of $2,500 are awarded to the respondent.    REASONS  [1] Mr Rafiq applies to this Court for leave to appeal against the decision of WildJ in the Court of Appeal.1 In that decision, Wild J dismissed Mr Rafiq’s application for review of a decision of the Registrar of the Court of Appeal. The decision of the Registrar dealt with an application by Mr Rafiq for an order dispensing with security for costs in relation to an appeal by Mr Rafiq against a decision of Courtney J in the High Court.2 Courtney J dismissed Mr Rafiq’s application for leave to bring a defamation action against the Commissioner of  1 Rafiq v The Commissioner of the New Zealand Police [2014]NZCA492 (Wild J). 2 Rafiq v Commissioner of New Zealand Police [2014] NZHC 814 (CourtneyJ).

[2] Wild J applied the principles in relation to dispensing with security for costs in the Court ofAppeal that were settled by this Court in Reekie v Attorney-General.3 Accordingly, the proposed appeal does not raise any issue of general or public importance. However, Mr Rafiq argues that leave should be granted because a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred or will occur if leave is not given. However, nothing in the material he has placed before this Court indicates that WildJ erred in any respect in his application of the principles stated in Reekie v Attorney-General. We are therefore satisfied that there is no risk of a miscarriage of justice.  [3] The application for leave to appeal is therefore dismissed.  [4] Costs of $2,500 are awarded to the respondent.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OFNEWZEALAND  [2015] NZSC 1   BETWEEN  VINCENT ROSS SIEMER Applicant   AND  REGISTRAR OFTHE SUPREME COURT First Respondent   MINISTRY OF JUSTICE Second Respondent    Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment: 10 February 2015  JUDGMENT OFGLAZEBROOK J  The application for review of the Registrar’s decision is dismissed.  REASONS  Background  [1] On 27 January 2015, Mr Siemer attempted to file in this Court an application for leave to appeal against a decision of the Deputy Registrar of the Court ofAppeal dated 21 January 2015.   [2] In that decision, the Deputy Registrar of the Court of Appeal refused to accept applications for filing as they related to an appeal that had been abandoned. The applications were described in the Deputy Registrar’s decision as an “Application for Review of the Deputy Registrar’s Refusal to Allow Filing” and an  VINCENTROSS SIEMER vREGISTRAR OF THE SUPREME COURT[2015] NZSC1[10February2015]  “Application for s 61A(2) Review Provided by the Judicature Act”. Mr Siemer did not provide the Court with a copy of the applications.   [3] On 28 January 2015, the Registrar of this Court refused to accept Mr Siemer’s application for leave to appeal for filing on the basis that this Court does not have jurisdiction under the Supreme Court Act 2003 to entertain Mr Siemer’s appeal as it was a decision made by a Deputy Registrar of the Court of Appeal and not by the Court ofAppeal.  [4] On 1 February 2015, Mr Siemer applied, under s 28(2) of the Supreme Court Act, for a review of the decision of the Registrar of this Court not to accept his leave application for filing.   Decision  [5] The decision in this case was made by the Deputy Registrar of the Court of Appeal and not by the Court ofAppeal. The Registrar was correct that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear the proposed appeal.1  [6] The Registrar was therefore correct to refuse to accept the application for leave.  The application for review is dismissed.  1 See Siemer v Stiassny [2013] NZSC 110 at [11] and A Person or Persons Unknown v Tea Custodians (Bluestone) Ltd [2011] NZSC 79 at [6]. These two decisions were referred to by the Registrar of this Court in his decision refusing to accept Mr Siemer’s application for filing.

Meredith Connell, Auckland.  HOWARD v NEW ZEALAND POLICE [2015] NZHC 105 [9 February 2015]  [1] The appellant has been charged with six counts of theft. She was sentenced to six months' imprisonment with six months' release conditions.  [2] For the reasons which will be given in my written decision, the appeal is allowed.  [3] The appellant has served three weeks imprisonment already.  [4] The Crown accepts that the guilty plea discount should in the circumstances have been the full allowance of 25 per cent which would have resulted in a five month sentence of imprisonment.  [SJ I take that into account and note that the Crown does not disagree that, in those circumstances, if the appeal is allowed, a combination of community work and supervision would be appropriate.  [6] The sentence which I impose after having allowed the appeal is a sentence of 250 hours of community work and 12 months supervision. The conditions of supervision are to be of those in the pre-sentence report dated 13 January 2015, that 1s:  ( a) She attends and completes an appropriate departmental programme to the satisfaction of a probation officer, the specific details to be determined by a probation officer.   (b)  She undertakes and completes appropriate assessment, treatment and counselling as directed by and to the satisfaction ofa probation officer to address the causes contributing to the offending.

B The appellant is to pay the sum of $5,880 by way of security for costs on or before 23 February 2015.  REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given by Harrison J)  [1] On 2 January 2015 the appellant, Razdan Rafiq, applied to review a decision later made by the Registrar on 17 December 2014, declining his application to dispense with security for costs on this appeal against a judgment delivered by AndrewsJin the High Courtat Auckland.1 TheRegistrar directed the securitybeset at $5,880.00 and be paid on or before 30 January2015.  Rafiq v The Commissioner of New Zealand Police [2015] NZHC 2837.  RAFIQ V THE COMMISSIONER OF NEWZEALANDPOLICE CA669/2014 [2015] NZCA8[5February 2015]  [2] MrRafiq is abankrupt. Herelies primarilyon his impecuniosityto assert that the Registrar erred. However, she was correct in law in deciding that “impecuniosity alone does not warrant dispensation from the requirement to pay securityfor costs”.  [3] The Registrar was also correct formulating the test to be applied as follows:  Security for costs will only be dispensed with where I am of the view that it is right to require the respondent to defend the judgment under challenge without the usual protection as to costs provided by security. If a reasonable and solvent litigant would not proceed with the appeal having regard to the benefits of bringing the appeal weighed against the costs of bringing the appeal, then security for costs will not be dispensed with.   [4] The Registrar carefully reviewed all the relevant circumstances including the judgment under appeal before concluding that there were no exceptional circumstances justifying dispensation, and nor did the appeal carry any significant public interest. She correctly concluded that it would not be right to require the Commissioner to defend the appeal without the usual protection for security for costs.  [5] Mr Rafiq has not identified any error of principle or law by the Registrar. Moreover, she was correct to conclude also that the appeal was vexatious. It is also hopeless.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date……………  LAYLAM HO andAVINATHANH PHUONGTRAN vMAIDEN HOMES LIMITED [2015] NZHC 91[5 February2015]  [1] These matters were called in the list on 11 November 2014. There were no appearances for any partyand I struck the proceedings out.  [2] Later, counsel for the defendant filed a memorandum in support of applications for costs. In response I delivered a minute indicating that applications for costs would be confined to the proceedings in the High Court, and not in connection with any developments concerning the obtaining of judgment in the District Court.  [3] Iadded that in the Court’s view costs ought to befixed on a 2B scale basis.   [4] The Court has now received costs memoranda on behalf of the defendant/judgment debtor, and in response on behalf of the plaintiffs/judgment creditors.  [5] The Court has given consideration to counsels’ submissions. The Court is of the view that whilst there were significant issues around the process by which judgment was obtained in the District Court, the process before the High Court has been relatively simple and straightforward.   [6] In response to the bankruptcy and liquidation applications brief notices of opposition/defence were filed.  [7] For the large part subsequent appearances were confined to reporting on progress with the application before the District Court to set aside the judgment.  [8] Whilst the Court’s initial view was that costs ought to be calculated in accordance with 2B, the Court now considers there is proper reason for an award using band 1B.  [9] The Court adopts Mr Patterson’s calculations and makes orders for costs accordingly.  Associate Judge Christiansen

Counsel have submitted a schedule prepared in accordance with the practice appropriate for Crown counsel under the Crown Solicitors Regulations 1994.  Counsel for the Crown accepts the way in which the schedule has been prepared.  That acceptance extends to the mechanics of the schedule and is not a reflection of the Crown’s position as to the appropriateness or amount of any costs order.     [3] The schedule gives a total of $32,967.  Applying the approach which I described in [22] and [23] of that judgment, I accept the schedule as representing the Crown rate for the steps undertaken.  I consider it appropriate to apply that rate in this case.     [4] I therefore award costs in the sum of $32,967.    1  R v Taylor [2014] NZHC 1165.            “A D MacKenzie J”

The judgment and costs award in Syntech’s favour in the District Court are set aside.  Judgment is entered for Idas against Syntech in the sum of $33,673.96 together with interest on that sum at the judicature rate. Interest is to run from the date ofissue of the proceedings in the District Court.  [2] Counsel for the successful appellant has applied to recall the judgment under r 11.9.  He seeks to havecosts in the District Court addressed by this Court.  [3] The principles to apply to an application for recall are settled.2 In this case, the appellant submits there are very special reasons why justice requires the judgment be recalled. It is submitted that it is a case of the Court overlooking the application for costs in the District Court, which were sought in counsel’s submissions.  [4] I decline the application for recall.  The Court dealt with the issue of costs on the appeal in this Court and to the extent that any costs have been awarded in the District Court (it seems costs were not settled in that Court), set that costs order aside. It was always the intention of the Court that costs in the District Court would be dealt with in that Court. I note counsel’s reference to s 76(1)(c) of the District Courts Act 1947, but in this case, the Court applied that to the costs in this Court.  [5] For those reasons, the application to recall the judgment is dismissed. It should be clear to counsel that the issue of costs in the District Court is to be dealt with in that Court.

[2] The parties have not been able to reach agreement regarding costs, largely it seems because the respondents now act for themselves and have not responded to correspondence from counsel for the appellants. For that reason I am now required to fix costs.  [3] I direct that the appellants are entitled to costs on a Category 2B basis together with disbursements as fixed by the Registrar. I approve the costs claimed by their counsel as set out in his memorandum dated 19 December 2014.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 104/2014 [2014] NZSC 191   BETWEEN  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON Applicant   AND  REGISTRAR OFTHE SUPREME COURT First Respondent   MINISTRY OF JUSTICE Second Respondent   Court:  William Young, Arnold and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person K Laurenson for Respondents   Judgment:  23 December 2014    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application to recall the judgment of 2 December 2014 and the second application for leave to appeal against the judgment of French J are dismissed.   REASONS  [1] The applicant has applied for the recall of the judgment of 2 December 20141 dismissing his application for leave to appeal against a judgment French J delivered on 2 October 2014.2 There is nothing in the material submitted which warrants a recall and the application is accordingly dismissed.  [2] On 8 December 2014, the applicant filed a second application for leave to appeal against the same judgment of French J. The basis of the proposed appeal rests on the assumption that French J made an order requiring him to paysecurityfor  1 Rabson v Registrar of the Supreme Court [2014] NZSC 175. 2 Rabson v Registrar of the Supreme Court [2014] NZCA481.  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON v REGISTRAR OF THE SUPREME COURT[2014] NZSC191[23 December 2014]  costs and that her order (which directed that his appeal be accepted for filing) operated retrospectively. Theapplicant also complains that the Court ofAppeal has not addressed his applications for a stay of the “order” and review of French J’s judgment under s 61A(2) of the JudicatureAct 1908.   [3] Leaving aside the fact that this is a second application, there is nothing of substance in it.   (a)  In her judgment, the Judge said that she was extending time to pay security for costs to ensure that the applicant was not disadvantaged by the delay.3 She then said, “Mr Rabson must pay security for costs or apply to the Registrar for dispensation of security within 20 working days …”.4 In the context, this was not an order that the applicant paysecurityfor costs but rather a description of the practical effect of the extension of time she granted.   (b)  There being no order, there was nothing to stay and there is, in this respect, nothing to challenge on appeal.   (c)  There is no jurisdiction under s 61A(2) to review the order of the Judge.5    [4] The second application for leave to appeal is accordingly dismissed.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 119/2014 [2014] NZSC 190   BETWEEN  PATRICK DEAN NORRIS Applicant   AND  BRUCE DONALD GEMMELLAND RHYS JAMES CAIN Respondents   Court:  William Young, Arnold and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person G K Riach for Respondents   Judgment:  19 December 2014    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant is to pay the respondents costs of $2,500 and reasonable disbursements to be fixed by the Registrar.    REASONS  [1] The applicant was the liquidator of four companies. On the afternoon of 16 October 2012, he was found guilty of theft (by failing to account)1 in respect of one of them.2 By reason of ss 280(1)(k) and 382(1)(b) of the Companies Act 1993, he was, from that point, disqualified from acting as a liquidator. Acting on the basis that there was, as a result, a vacancyin the office of liquidator,3 the Official Assignee appointed the respondents as liquidators under s 283(6) of the Companies Act. The respondents applied for a search order in respect of the applicant’s premises, which  1 CrimesAct 1961,s220. 2 R v Norris DCNelsonCRI-2011-42-1272,16 October 2012. 3 Companies Act 1993,s283(1).  PATRICK DEAN NORRIS v BRUCE DONALD GEMMELLAND RHYS JAMES CAIN [2014] NZSC 190[19 December 2015]  was duly executed. In issue now is a challenge to the search order. This challenge was dismissed in the High Court4 and Court of Appeal.5  [2] A primary basis of the challenge in those courts and the sole focus of the applicant’s submissions in support of the application for leave is that he had, on the morning of 16 October 2012, that is, before he was found guilty, appointed another person as liquidator. The argument is that the appointment of the other person was effective, there was no vacancy in the office and the respondents’ appointment as liquidators was invalid with the result that they had no right to apply for a search order.   [3] Both the High Court and Court of Appeal held that the applicant’s resignations and his appointment of the other person as liquidator were not effective because notice of the appointment, as required by s 283(2) of the Companies Act, was not sent or delivered to the Registrar of Companies until 18 October 2012.6 The applicant disputes that conclusion. He says that when regard is had to the whole statutory scheme, including ss 241, 241A, 255, 280, 282 and 283 of the Companies Act, his resignation and the appointment of the other person was effective prior to his conviction in the afternoon of 16 October 2012.  [4] This is a unique case with unusual facts. We are not persuaded that the proposed appeal raises any issue of public or general importance. As well, the applicant’s arguments, at least in the round, have been fully considered in the reasoned judgments of the High Court and Court of Appeal and the interpretation adopted is in accordance with the language of s 283(2). More generally, there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date: ...............................  AUCKLAND CITY COUNCIL v MAWHINNEY [2014] NZHC 3316 [18 December 2014]  [I] By my decision dated 7 October 2014, I dismissed Mr Mawhinney's application for review ofdecisions ofDoogue AJ.  [2]  Paragraph 37 ofmy decision says:   There would seem no reason why costs should not follow the event on a 2B basis. If an agreement cannot be reached however, the Council is to file and serve a memorandum within 21 days of this decision. Any response from Mr Mawhinney is to be filed and served 14 days thereafter.   [3]  I have received a memorandum of counsel for the Auckland Council.  The    Council seeks scale costs and disbursements on a category 2B basis, totalling $6,130. The Council has sought those costs from Mr Mawhinney but he has failed to respond to the Council's communications. Mr Mawhinney has not filed a memorandum in response to that ofthe Auckland Council.  [4] I am satisfied that costs on a 2B basis are appropriate and they are awarded accordingly.   ThomasJ

REASONS  Introduction  [1] After a jury trial in the Whanganui District Court, the applicant, Mr van der Lubbe, was convicted of one count of threatening to cause grievous bodily harm and onecount of threateningto kill.1 He was fined $1,000 on each count.2  [2] TheCourt ofAppeal dismissed his appeal against conviction and sentence on 8 October 2014.3 Mr van der Lubbe seeks leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal decision.  1 Contrarytothe Crimes Act1961,s306(1)(a).  2 R v van der Lubbe DC Whanganui CRI-2012-083-402, 29 April 2013 (Sentencing Notes of Judge Cameron).  3 van der Lubbe v R [2014] NZCA495 (EllenFrance P, MacKenzie andAndrews JJ).  JACOBUSVAN DER LUBBE v R [2014] NZSC 187[17 December 2014]   Background  [3] The object of the threats was Mr van der Lubbe’s neighbour but the threats were made in the course of two telephone conversations with police communicators on the 111 emergency services line and not to the neighbour.   [4] Mr van der Lubbe admitted the telephone calls but sought to rely on provocation and self defence. He explained in evidence that he had made the telephone calls to lay a “paper trail” and that he wanted to be arrested so he could “tell [his] story” in court about the dispute with his neighbour and thereby bring an end to that dispute.   Discussion  [5] Mr van der Lubbe essentially seeks to raise the same issues before us as in the Court ofAppeal. Theissues hewishes to canvass raise no issues ofprinciple and largely concern factual issues. Nothing he has raised suggests that the Court of Appeal’s conclusion on those matters may have been wrong. There is no risk of a miscarriage of justice.   Result  [6] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  Solicitors: Crown Law Office, Wellington for Respondent

That sentence is subject to the post-detention conditions recommended in the probation report, namely that:   (a) Mr Watt is to attend a psychological assessment with a Department psychologist and to attend and complete any treatment/counselling as recommended in that assessment to the satisfaction of a probation officer and treatment provider; and   (b) Mr Watt is to attend and complete an appropriate alcohol and drug treatment programme to the satisfaction of the programme provider     and a probation officer (the appropriate programme is to be determined by a probation officer).

Adirection was madethat copies of all invoices supporting the disbursement claim were to be provided to the Court and Mr Davis. A further judgment would then be issued. In a memorandum dated  1 Davis v Commissioner of Police [2014] NZEmpC 195.  STEPHEN DAVISvCOMMISSIONER OF POLICE NZEmpC AUCKLAND  [2014]NZEmpC 225[12 December 2014]  21 November 2014, counsel for the Commissioner has provided a full schedule of disbursements supported by copies of invoices.   [2] Mr Davis was given an opportunity to respond to the further memorandum but has failed to do so within the time period provided.   [3] The total claim to disbursements is now $20,136.33. This figure is less than the disbursements figureoriginally claimed by the defendant.   [4] Having considered the schedule and the invoices attached, the claim to disbursements is allowed except in one respect. In the schedule there are claims to disbursements in November 2011. These are disbursements relating to a settlement meeting in Christchurch in October 2011. It appears that the defendant agreed to cover the expenses incurred by Mr Davis’s legal representatives in travelling to and from Christchurchfor that meeting.  I have been provided with no details of the basis upon which theseexpenses weremet bythedefendant orthe conditions attaching. It seems to me that if the defendant agreed to cover those expenses then they should not be claimed back from Mr Davis. Accordingly, those items are disallowed. They amount in total to $1,393.40 and this figure is to be deducted from the total claim of $20,136.33 leavinga balance of $18,742.93.   [5] Mr Davis is therefore ordered to pay this sum to the defendant.   M E Perkins Judge  Judgment signed at 11.30 am on 12 December 2014  
IN THE EMPLOYMENT COURT WELLINGTON [2014] NZEmpC 228 WRC 12/14  IN THE MATTER OF  a challenge to a determination of the   Employment Relations Authority   BETWEEN  SAI SYSTEMS LIMITED   Plaintiff    AND GRAEME BIRD Defendant  Hearing: (on the papers by memoranda filed on 2 and 12 December 2014)  Counsel: B Buckett, counsel for the plaintiff T Kennedy, counsel for the defendant  Judgment: 12 December 2014  INTERLOCUTORY JUDGMENT OF JUDGE A D FORD  [1] On 22 September 2014, I issued a judgment1 in this proceeding upholding a determination of the Employment Relations Authority (the Authority) dated 24 March 20142 in which it declined an application by the plaintiff to join another party as a defendant. Although the challenge was unsuccessful I reserved the issue of costs.  The substantive employment issue is still before the Authority.  [2] On 2 December 2014, Ms Kennedy, counsel for the defendant, filed a detailed application for costs in both the Authority and this Court in relation to the joinder application and she requested a timetabling order to enable submissions to be made in response and reply. Ms Kennedy advised that the investigation into the substantive matter in the Authority is part heard and is rescheduled to continue on 27 March (presumably 2015).  1 Sai Systems Ltd v Bird [2014] NZEmpC 177. 2 Bird v Sai Systems Ltd [2014] NZERA Wellington 27.  SAI SYSTEMS LIMITED v GRAEME BIRD NZEmpC WELLINGTON [2014] NZEmpC 228 [12 December 2014]  [3] Ms Buckett, counsel for the plaintiff, has submitted that the costs issues should be held-over pending final determination of the substantive matter before the Authority. Ms Kennedy in response submitted that the issue of joinder was a discreet matter that had finally been determined by the Court and, as such, the plaintiff was entitled to have costs fixed and paid at this stage.  [4] Although no authority was cited on the issue and this Court has a discretion  as to costs, the defendant’s application is consistent with rr 14.2(a) and 14.8(1) of the  High Court Rules which collectively provide that unless there are special reasons to the contrary, a successful party to an interlocutory matter can expect to have costs fixed and thereupon they become payable by the losing party.  [5] The timetabling order the plaintiff seeks would require all submissions to be filed prior to the Christmas vacation but Ms Buckett has advised that she will be unavailable between 15 December 2014 and 20 January 2015. In the circumstances, I consider that the suggested timetable is too onerous on the defendant. I also consider that as the substantive matter is still before the Authority, it is appropriate  that any application for costs in relation to the Authority’s determination on the  interlocutory issue should be dealt with in that jurisdiction.  [6] I, therefore, order that Ms Buckett is to file her submissions in response on or before Friday, 23 January 2015 and Ms Kennedy is to file submissions in reply by 30 January 2015.  I will then deal with the matter on the papers.  A D Ford Judge  Judgment signed at 3.45 pm on 12 December 2014

REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a decision of Harrison J, dismissing the application for review of the decision of the Registrar of the Court of Appeal refusing to dispense with security for costs and ordering him to pay security for costs on or before 3 November 2014.1 The underlying appeal concerns a judgment of the High Court ordering the applicant to pay security for costs in proceedings brought against the Commissioner of New Zealand Police alleging that he had been assaulted bya police officer.2  1 Rafiq v Commissioner of New Zealand Police [2014] NZCA500. 2 Rafiq v Commissioner of New Zealand Police [2014] NZHC 2074.  RAZDAN RAFIQ v COMMISSIONER OF NEWZEALAND POLICE [2014] NZSC 181[10 December 2014]  [2] The principles applicable to dispensing with security for costs in the Court of Appeal were settled by this Court in Reekie v Attorney-General.3 The proposed appeal does not raise any fresh issue of general or public importance. There is no error of principle in Harrison J’s approach. Nor is there any risk of a miscarriage of justice.  [3] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2014-485-006017 [2014] NZHC 3141  BETWEEN MAREE HOWARD Plaintiff  AND ACCIDENT COMPENSATION CORPORATION Defendant  Hearing: On the papers  Judgment: 10 December 2014  COSTS JUDGMENT OF CLIFFORD J  [1] On 3 October 2014 I issued a judgment striking out Mrs Howard’s application for judicial review to set aside an October 2010 notice issued by her accredited employer, NZ Post Ltd, under s 72 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001. I did so on the basis that that, and the associated issues she raised, had already been addressed by the Courts.   [2] Having succeeded in its application, Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) now applies for scale 2B costs of $13,814.99 to be paid by Mrs Howard.  [3] As the history of the matter, recorded at paragraph 13 of my judgment, shows, Mrs Howard – supported and represented by her husband Mr Howard, has pursued her complaint in an extended series of appeals and applications for special leave to appeal, including to each of this Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.  HOWARD v ACCIDENT COMPENSATION CORPORATION [2014] NZHC 3141 [10 December 2014]  [4] I therefore have some sympathy with the Corporation’s proposition that here costs should, in the normal event, follow the outcome of the application on a scale basis. The other relevant principle here is that, so far as possible, the determination of costs should be predictable and expeditious. Those principles favour me ordering costs as sought by ACC.  [5] Mrs Howard opposes any award of costs. In her memorandum of 3 November 2014 she argues that the issues she raised were ones of public interest, she points to her limited personal means and repeats, by way of criticising my judgment (which of course she is perfectly entitled to do) the substance of her complaint.  [6] Mr and Mrs Howard have pursued a lengthy battle through the courts. They have had costs awarded against them on at least one occasion previously, in the Court of Appeal. At the same time, I accept their honesty and genuineness and that an award of the amount sought by ACC is a significant sum of money for people in their position.  [7] On that basis, and in terms of r 14.7(g) I have decided not to award costs as ACC seeks. At the same time, however, I think some award of costs is appropriate, given the outcome.   [8] I therefore order that Mrs Howard pays costs in the sum of $2,500 to ACC.  “Clifford J”  Solicitors: McBride Davenport James, Solicitors, Wellington for respondent.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND   CA613/2014 [2014] NZCA 603   BETWEEN  HATA MITAI Appellant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Court:  Randerson, Harrison and Stevens JJ   Counsel:  M Dixon for Appellant B F Fenton for Respondent   Judgment: (On the papers)  9 December 2014 at 3:00 pm    JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  With the consent of the respondent:  A  Leave to appeal is granted.    B  The appeal is allowed.   C  The matter is remitted to the High Court for consideration of the   appellant’s appeal to that Court on the merits.     REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given by Randerson J)  MITAI vR CA613/2014 [2014] NZCA603[9 December 2014]  [1] After this application for leave to appeal was filed, I issued a minute on 1 December 2014 inviting the respondent to consent to the application for leave to appeal and to allowing the appeal.  [2] I did so on the basis that, in dismissing the appellant’s appeal from the District Court as abandoned, the High Court must have been relying on s 338 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011. The Crown accepts that the mandatory notice under s 338(2) was not given. This requires the Court to give the appellant ten working days’ notice of its intention to dismiss the appeal under that section. While the Criminal Procedure Act provides a formal process for an appellant to abandon an appeal under s 337, it does not provide for a Judge to treat an appeal as abandoned.  [3] In response to the minute of the Court, the Crown has now advised that it consents to the proposal contained therein.  [4] Accordingly, with the consent of the respondent:  (a)  Leave to appeal is granted.    (b)  The appeal is allowed.   (c)  The matter is remitted to the High Court for consideration of the appellant’s appeal to that Court on the merits.    [5] It will be a matter for the High Court to determine whether further evidence may be allowed on the appeal and otherwise to give any directions that may be necessary to progress the appeal.

         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY    CRI-2014-485-86  [2014] NZHC 3132       SHANE HALL        v        NEW ZEALAND POLICE       Hearing:     9 December 2014      Counsel:     S Hall in person  W S Taffs for Respondent      Judgment:     9 December 2014         JUDGMENT OF WILLIAMS J     [1] On 6 November 2014, the appellant was convicted of driving with excess breath alcohol for a third or subsequent time.  He was fined $500 and disqualified from holding a driver’s licence for 12 months.  He was further sentenced to nine months’ supervision and to attend any programme directed by Probation.   [2] The appellant appeals conviction but not sentence.  The sentence is, he accepts, fair if he is guilty.   [3] The appellant does not deny that he was driving his car on the night along the Petone Esplanade.  He was apparently swerving along the road and admitted, when pulled over, that he had been drinking.  He does not deny that a breath screening test was applied, nor does he dispute the result of the evidential breath test at 615 micrograms of alcohol per litre of breath.  The appellant’s case is a procedural one.    [4] The essence of the appellant’s case is that he is dyslexic and suffers from limited literacy.  He said he did not understand “a lot of the information they provided me” about his rights on arrest.  He said he did not receive any information in respect of his right to require an evidential blood test.  He was, he said, not advised of these things orally.   [5] The arresting constable gave evidence at trial that the appellant was verbally advised of his rights at the side of the road and that at each stage he was further advised verbally and in writing of his rights.  The appellant said this was not true.   [6] In a carefully reasoned and succinct judgment, the learned District Court Judge preferred the evidence of the arresting constable to that of the appellant.  The constable was sober.  The appellant was not.  He had been observed weaving across the road and had admitted drinking.  The appellant admitted in evidence he had been provided a summary of his rights verbally at the side of the road.  The Judge inferred from the fact that the appellant had signed the relevant form at each stage of the process that he had been given and read his rights.  This is long-standing and standard procedure and the Judge had no reason to doubt that the procedure had been followed in the appellant’s case.  Indeed the appellant admitted that when he had previously been arrested, he had in fact undertaken a blood test so was aware of this right.   [7] The learned Judge saw both witnesses and was able to undertake the necessary assessment.  I am in no position to gainsay that assessment.  I see no basis, on the record before me, to conclude that the Judge was wrong to prefer the constable’s evidence over that of the appellant.   [8] The appeal must be dismissed accordingly.              ___________________________      Williams J

B  The questions of law are:   1  Did the Panel err in law in:   (a)  failing to make findings (supported by reasons) as to who the beneficial owners of the lands at issue were pre-1893?   (b)  failing to determine the parties’ claims to the lands having regard to those findings?

Did the Panel err in law in finding that Crown purchases of individualised interests in the lands after 1893 resulted in loss of the mana whenua of the hapu in respect of those lands?  3 Did the Panel err in law by treating Crown purchases of individualised interests in land post-1893 as a relevant consideration in determining the dispute before it?  4 Did the Panel err in law in its approach to s 348 of the Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993?  C The proceeding is remitted to the High Court to determine the applicants’ appeal on the identified questions of law in accordance with the application for special leave dated 17 October 2014.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 102/2014 [2014] NZSC 177   BETWEEN  VICTORIAELIZABETH BETHELL as administrator of the estate of ROSS MCKAY BETHELL First Applicant   MARIA GAEL BETHELL Second Applicant   AND  CHRISTINEANNE BETHELL Respondent    Court: McGrath, William Young and Glazebrook JJ Counsel: SA Grant for theApplicants  R JThompson for the Respondent Judgment: 3 December 2014  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicants must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent.    REASONS  [1] John Bethell died in 1985. Under his will, his son Ross Bethell (now deceased) inherited a large block of land at Bethells Beach. This was subject to one of John’s daughters, Christine Bethell (Chrissie), having a lease during her life time of “ten (10) acres more or less together with the camp and shop buildings thereon (if any)” and having the right to have the 10 acres transferred to her if a subdivision could be achieved.  VICTORIAELIZABETH BETHELLas administrator ofthe estate ofROSS MCKAYBETHELLv CHRISTINE ANNE BETHELL[2014] NZSC 177[3December 2014]  [2] There were difficulties in implementing the will, which led to a deed of family arrangement in 1987. Under the deed, Ross agreed that Chrissie could call for “an allotment of up to 10 acres in the area known as the camping grounds1 near the main road” as long as local authority consent to the subdivision was obtained during the joint lives of Ross and Chrissie.  [3] Chrissie obtained resource consent for the subdivision of 10 acres. Ross refused to transfer the land to her, maintaining she was only entitled to the camping ground land itself, an area of approximatelyfive acres.  [4] The High Court upheld Chrissie’s claim to the 10 acres2and an appeal against that decision was dismissed in the Court ofAppeal, except that Chrissie was held to be responsible for the costs of obtaining the subdivision’s resource consent.3  [5] The applicants apply for leave to appeal to this Court.  [6] This matter involves the interpretation of a one-off deed. As a result, no issues of general or commercial importance arise. The matter has been thoroughly examined by the High Court and the Court of Appeal. Nothing that has been put forward by the applicants suggests that the courts below erred in the approach to the interpretation of the deed in the context of the particular circumstances of this case.  [7] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  [8] The applicants must paycosts of $2,500 to the respondent.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WHANGAREI REGISTRY  CRl-2014-488-44 (2014] NZHC 3076   BETWEEN  TROY DANIEL ELLIS . Appellant   AND  NEW ZEALAND POLICE Respondent   Hearing:  3 December 2014    Appearances: No appearance by Appellant MAJarman-Taylor for the Respondent  Judgment: 3 December 2014  ORAL JUDGMENT OF VENNING J  Solicitors: Crown Solicitor, Whangarei Copy To: Appellant  ELLIS v NEW ZEALAND POLICE [2014] NZHC 3076 [3 December 2014]  [1] Following a defended hearing in the District Court at Whangarei Troy Ellis was convicted on one charge of driving a motor vehicle while impaired and with blood containing evidence of the use of cannabis. Judge D J McDonald subsequently fined him $250, Court costs $130, analyst's fees $752.63 and disqualified him from holding or obtaining a driver's licence for six months from 23 October 2014.  [2] Mr Ellis represented himself before the District Court and filed an appeal on his own behalf. The appeal was stated to be against sentence.  [3] No submissions have been filed on behalf of Mr Ellis in support ofthe appeal and when the matter was called this afternoon there was no appearance by or on behalf ofMr Ellis.  [4] The notice ofthe date of the hearing of this appeal was sent to Mr Ellis at the address he recorded as his address on the notice of general appeal.  [5] As there is no appearance in support of the appeal it could be dismissed for want of prosecution. However, in preparation for the appeal I reviewed the appeal file and I am satisfied that on its merits there is no substance to the appeal against sentence and indeed, for that matter, of any prospect of an appeal against conviction succeeding.  [6] The Judge in a carefully considered reserved decision correctly identified the elements of the offending, rehearsed and considered the evidence relating to those elements, and found each of the elements proved beyond reasonable doubt. In those circumstances a conviction was inevitable.  [7] The sentence imposed, bearing in mind the maximum penalty available for offending of this nature, was towards the lower end of the scale and the period of disqualification is the minimum period prescribed by law.  [8] In the circumstances the appeal is dismissed on its merits.  Venning J  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CIV 2014-404-2424 [2014] NZHC 3059  BETWEEN BRENT DOUGLAS CLODE Plaintiff  AND THOMPSON PARK HOLDINGS LTD First Defendant  DAVID ROBERT JANS Second Defendant  Hearing: 3 December 2014  Counsel: B D Clode, in person, Plaintiff P T Finnigan for Defendants  Judgment: 3 December 2014  (ORAL) JUDGMENT OF HEATH J  Solicitors: Carson Fox Bradley Ltd, Auckland Counsel: P T Finnigan, Auckland Copy to: Mr B R Clode, Plaintiff  CLODE v THOMPSON PARK HOLDINGS LTD [2014] NZHC 3059 [3 December 2014]  [1] This proceeding was brought by Mr Clode. It relates to a claim that there was an incorrect statement of shareholding in the Register of Shares for Thompson Park Holdings Ltd. Relief was sought in the form of rectification of the share register. A claim was also made against Mr Jans, who was responsible for the way in which the share register had been prepared.   [2] Since the claim was issued, Thompson Park Holdings Ltd, has been put into liquidation. An order to that effect was made on 14 November 2014. Section 284(1)(c) of the Companies Act 1993 prevents proceedings being continued against a company that has been put into liquidation without the consent of the liquidator or an order of the Court. That means that the proceeding against Thompson Park Holdings Ltd is effectively stayed.  [3] Section 248(1)(d) also provides that no shares in the company can be transferred to another, unless the Court otherwise orders.1 That may be the mode of rectification that is required should the point still be relevant once the available assets have been used for payment of any creditors. It is something that Mr Clode can liaise with the liquidator about.   [4] The cause of action against Mr Jans seeks an order declaring that he has committed an offence against s 91 of the Companies Act 1993. I have explained to Mr Clode that this Court exercising civil jurisdiction cannot make a declaration that a person has committed a criminal offence. That being the case, I have suggested that he make any complaint to the Registrar of Companies, so that it may be investigated if it has substance.  [5] Mr Clode accepts that no useful purpose would be served by keeping this proceeding alive. In those circumstances, the claim is dismissed, with no order as to costs.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA499/2014 [2014] NZCA 587  BETWEEN  SUSAN MARIE HEAZLEWOOD Appellant   AND  JOIE DEVIVRE CANTERBURYLTD Respondent   Court:  Miller, Heath and Dobson JJ   Counsel:  A M Corry for Appellant J E Bayley for Respondent   Judgment:  2 December 2014 at 2.00 pm    (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  Request to anonymise and redact judgment declined. The Registrar should now release it.   REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Miller J)  [1] Counsel for the respondent has sought anonymisation of the judgment, redaction of certain material in it, and orders prohibiting search of the Court of Appeal file.  Counsel for Mrs Heazlewood agrees in part.  [2] No grounds have been made out for anonymisation. Mr Bayley suggests that it is commonplace to anonymise the parties in proceedings involving maintenance and relationship property. He points out that the High Court has done it in this very case. But s 11B of the Family Courts Act 1980, which applies to relationship  HEAZLEWOOD v JOIE DE VIVRE CANTERBURYLTD CA499/2014 [2014] NZCA587[2 December 2014]  property proceedings,1 provides that any person may publish a report of proceedings except in certain circumstances none of which is said to applyin this case.  [3] Nor are we prepared to have any details redacted from the judgment. No justification has been advanced for removing the reference to Lane Neave and the caveat number. The judgment should be released accordingly.  [4] It is not necessary to direct that the court file not be searched without leave.  Rule 11(5) of the Court of Appeal (Access to Court Documents) Rules 2009, which corresponds to r 3.12(2) of the High Court Rules, provides that only with the Court’s permission may a person access a document that relates to a proceeding brought under the Property (Relationships) Act 1976, as this one was. That extends to the case on appeal, which contains the allegedly sensitive information.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 104/2014 [2014] NZSC 175   BETWEEN  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON Applicant   AND  REGISTRAR OFTHE SUPREME COURT First Respondent   MINISTRY OF JUSTICE Second Respondent   Court:  William Young, Arnold and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person K Laurenson for Respondents   Judgment:  2 December 2014    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant and another person were joint plaintiffs in judicial review proceedings. Dobson J held that these proceedings ought not to have been accepted for filing because of the terms of a vexatious litigant order against the applicant’s co-plaintiff.1 The applicant has subsequently issued replacement proceedings in his sole name and these were accepted for filing. But, more relevantly, he also filed a notice of appeal against the order made by Dobson J. The Deputy Registrar of the Court of Appeal refused to accept this notice on the basis that the applicant is an undischarged bankrupt. An application by the applicant to review that decision was  Siemer v Registrar of the Supreme Court HCWellingtonCIV-2014-485-10918,25August 2014.  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON v REGISTRAR OF THE SUPREME COURT[2014] NZSC175[2 December 2014]  allowed by French J, who directed that his notice of appeal be accepted for filing as of the date on which it was filed.2  [2] In the courseof determining the application, French J:  (a)  saw s 101(1)(b) of the Insolvency Act 2006 as applicable to the applicant’s appeal on the basis that his appeal rights if any in relation to the judicial review proceedings were vested in the Official Assignee;3 but   (b)  thought it arguable that by reason of an alleged waiver by the Official Assignee, the applicant might be entitled to appeal, an issue which she thought should be determined bya panel of three judges.4    She concluded by saying that, “The issue as to whether Mr Rabson is in fact entitled to bring the appeal will be dealt with at the substantive hearing”.5  [3] The applicant wishes to challenge in this Court the conclusion of the Judge referred to above  in [2](a). The difficulty, however, is that the actual decision of the Judge (which was to direct that his notice of appeal be accepted for filing) was in his favour. So he is seeking to challenge not the decision itself, but rather the reasons. As explained in Independent Fisheries Ltd v Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery, this Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain challenges of that kind.6  [4] There is no hardship for the applicant in this conclusion. This is because, in addressing the issue identified by French J, the Court of Appeal panel which hears his appeal will have no choice but to grapple with the accuracy or otherwise of her views as to the effect of s 101(1)(b).

REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by French J)  [1] Mr Martin has filed an application for leave to appeal a decision of Peters J in the High Court.1 The High Court decision was itself an appeal against a conviction entered in the District Court for cultivating cannabis.2  [2] The application for leave to appeal to this Court purports to be filed pursuant to pt 6 of the Criminal ProcedureAct 2011.  1 Martin v New Zealand Police [2013] NZHC 2376. 2 New Zealand Police v Martin DCHamilton CRI-2012-019-5834,6June 2013.  MARTIN v R CA425/2014[2014] NZCA582 [1 December 2014]  [3] Theproceedings againstMr Martin commenced in the District Court in April 2012. His proposed appeal is therefore governednot bytheCriminal ProcedureAct, but by s 144 of the Summary ProceedingsAct 1957.  [4] The effect of s 144 is that this Court has no jurisdiction to consider MrMartin’s application. Thecorrect course ofaction is forMr Martin to first seek leave from the High Court to appeal to this Court. If the High Court declines leave, then he may apply to this Court for special leave, but not otherwise.  [5] Mr Martin was advised of the jurisdictional problem and given an opportunity to make submissions,3 but failed to do so.  [6] This is an application for leave to appeal that should be dealt with on the papers and we so direct.4  [7] We dismiss the application for leave to appeal on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction.

I reserved the question of costs and invited the parties to file submissions.  [2] Ms Tahana is legally aided. Under s 45(2) of the Legal Services Act 2011 no award for costs may be made against an aided person in civil proceedings unless the Court is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances.  [3] Mr Litchfield, for Ms Tahana, responsibly concedes that there are no exceptional circumstances engaged by this appeal but seeks the payment of her actual costs of $2,564.68 which is considerably less than the $4,950 which is the sum calculated on a 2B basis. Mr McKenna submits that given there are no exceptional circumstances it would not be appropriate to award costs against Ms Clark personally. He further notes that she is a retired beneficiary with no significant assets and would have great difficulty satisfying any award of costs. He submits that the successful appellant's costs should be met by the estate.  [4] !agree.  Result  [5] The respondent is entitled to costs in the sum of $2,564.68 and reasonable disbursements as fixed by the Registrar.  [6] These are to be paid from the estate.

[2] The appeal and cross appeal focus primarily on directions given by the Judge that disqualified a partner in a firm of solicitors in Hamilton from acting as counsel for Mr Redwood but permitted the firm to continue to act as solicitors.2 As these points have become moot, neither party wishes to proceed with their appeals against those orders.  The appeal and cross appeal is dismissed in relation to each.   [3] Judge Twaddle was asked to make some admissibility rulings. Counsel accept that he was under a misapprehension as to certain parts of Mr Redwood’s affidavit that he was being asked to exclude as inadmissible. The Judge directed that paras 23–43 (inclusive) of Mr Redwood’s affidavit of 14 August 2012 were inadmissible.3 The appeal against that order is allowed, to the extent that paras 23– 28, 34, 35 and 40–42 are ruled admissible.

REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given byCooper J)  [1] Mr He has filed a “minute” in which he seeks a “rehearing”, following the Court’s judgment of 6 November 2014.  Although not couched as such, we treat the minute as an application for recall of our judgment.  [2] In it, Mr He refers to his limited English ability, notes that he had “applied for an interpreter before the hearing” and that his application was refused. He also claims that he was not allowed to explain supplemental information at the hearing.  [3] In the result, he says that the Court’s decision was seriously affected by imprecise and insufficient information.  HE V BAI CA420/2014 [2014] NZCA563[26 November 2014]  [4] Mr He has not identified any error in the Court’s decision and the matters raised do not justify recall of the judgment. None of the circumstances discussed in Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2) applies.1  [5] Consequently, the application is dismissed.  Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2) [1968]NZLR 632 (SC).

[2] Later that same day, the Registry received a lengthy email from Dr Graham commenting on individual paragraphs in the judgment and asking that the email be put before the Judge as soon as possible. In the circumstances, we have treated this email as an application for a review of the judgment by three Judges of this Court.  [3] Having considered the matter, we see no basis on which we should reach conclusions in respect of Dr Graham’s applications that differ from those of William Young J. Accordingly, the orders in William Young J’s judgment of 24 November 2014 are confirmed.  Solicitors: MacalisterTodd Phillips, Queenstown for Respondent 
         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  AUCKLAND REGISTRY    CIV 2014-404-001281  [2014] NZHC 2956       UNDER     the Judicature Amendment Act 1972      BETWEEN     JOHN GEORGE RUSSELL  Applicant      AND     THE COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE  Respondent       Hearing:     25 November 2014      Appearances:     SRG Judd for Applicant  P Courtney for Respondent      Judgment:     25 November 2014         (ORAL) JUDGMENT (NO. 2) OF ANDREWS J   [Respondent's application for recall]           [1] In my judgment delivered on 26 August 2014 I granted the interim relief sought by the applicant, namely:1    1  Russell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue [2014] NZHC 2034 at [46].  … I have concluded that an interim order should be made prohibiting the Commissioner from commencing bankruptcy proceedings against Mr Russell, pending further order of the Court.  [2] The Commissioner has filed a notice of appeal against my judgment.   [3] On 3 November 2014, the Commissioner filed an application seeking recall of my judgment, to amend the form of relief granted.  In a memorandum in support of the application, Mrs Courtney noted that my attention had not been drawn to s 8(2) of the Judicature Amendment Act 1972, and relevant consequential provisions in the Crown Proceedings Act 1950.  Briefly summarised, Mrs Courtney submitted that the appropriate order to make against the Commissioner was a declaration that the Commissioner ought not to commence bankruptcy proceedings.  She submitted that the Court did not have jurisdiction to make an “interim order”.   [4] I directed that the application be served on counsel for Mr Russell.  On 24 November 2014, Mr Judd filed a memorandum opposing the application for recall.  He submitted that it is by no means certain whether the appropriate form in which the Commissioner is to be restrained from taking certain actions is by way of a declaration or an order.  He referred to cases where an order had been made.   [5] This issue was not argued before me at the hearing, I do not consider it appropriate to deal with it now.  Accordingly, I decline the application for recall.  The judgment is to be sealed as delivered.   [6] However, for the assistance of the parties, and any Court considering the judgment subsequently, I record that, whether the relief was in the form of a declaration or an order, it would have been to the same effect.  That is, the Commissioner is restrained from commencing bankruptcy proceedings against Mr Russell, pending further order of the Court.      ________________________    Andrews  J  
NOTE:  THE ORDER MADE BYTHE HIGH COURT ON 28 MAY 2012 PROHIBITING PUBLICATION OFTHE PARTIES' NAMESAND ANY PARTICULARSTHATWOULD IDENTIFYTHE RESPONDENT (INCLUDING HER NAME, OCCUPATION, EMPLOYMENT HISTORYAND HEALTH) REMAINS IN FORCE PENDING FURTHER ORDER OFTHE HIGH COURT.  IN THE SUPREME COURT OFNEWZEALAND SC 78/2014 [2014] NZSC 168  BETWEEN LFDB Appellant  AND SM Respondent  Court: McGrath, William Young, Glazebrook, Arnold and O'Regan JJ  Counsel: M S Smith forAppellant A E Hinton QC for Respondent  Judgment: 20 November 2014  JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  A  The application for a stay of the Court of Appeal’s judgment (SM v LFDB [2014] NZCA326) and for a further direction that copies of documents be provided to the appellant is dismissed.   B  The appellant is to pay the respondent costs of $2,500 and reasonable disbursements to be fixed by the Registrar.     REASONS  [1] The appellant has been given leave to appeal against a judgment of the Court of Appeal debarring him from taking further part in relationship property proceedings in the High Court between him and the respondent.1 The appeal will be  LFDB v SM [2014] NZSC 131.  LFDB vSM [2014] NZSC 168[20 November 2014]  heard by this Court on 5 December 2014. As aconsequence of the Court of Appeal’s judgment, the High Court has set down the proceeding for a formal proof hearing which is to commence on 12 March 2015. We expect that we will be able to deliver judgment before then.  [2] The appellant has applied for a stay of the Court of Appeal’s judgment, pending the outcome of the appeal to this Court. He also seeks a direction that the respondent provide him with copies of all documents filed by the respondent in both the High Court and Court ofAppeal, and any judicial determinations made on them, since delivery of the Court of Appeal’s judgment. The respondent opposes both aspects of the application.  [3] Unless a stay is granted, the respondent will continue to take steps in anticipation of the formal proof hearing. The appellant’s contention is that there is a risk that, if he is successful in his appeal, steps taken by the respondent, and perhaps by the courts, which are based on the Court of Appeal’s judgment, will have to be undone at cost to the appellant and to the judicial system. Court orders may also be made against him, in his absence, that may cause him prejudice.   [4] This is not, however, a case in which the appeal will be made nugatory if a stay is refused. Nor, in our view, will the appellant’s position be significantly prejudiced in those circumstances if this appeal succeeds. Overall, the reasons given for taking steps to protect the appellant’s position, in case he is successful in the appeal, do not outweigh the respondent’s right to act in accordance with the judgment of the Court ofAppeal unless and until it is set aside.  [5] Nor do we see any reason in this case for us to intervene in the processes of the High Court in relation to service of documents on the appellant. That is a matter for the High Court.  [6] The application is dismissed. The appellant is to pay to the respondent costs of $2,500 together with any disbursements to be approved by the Registrar.

The Judge who sentenced him declined to discharge Mr Chand without conviction. Instead, he ordered Mr Chand to come up for sentence if called upon to do so within 12 months.1 Mr Chand has appealed to this Court against the Judge’s refusal to grant a discharge without conviction.  [2] On 4 November 2014, the Registrar sent out the required notice advising Mr Chand of the fact that the appeal would be heard today at 10 am. When the appeal was called, however, there was no appearance by Mr Chand or by counsel on his behalf. No submissions have been filed in support of the appeal. For that reason the Court must proceed on the basis that Mr Chand has elected not to prosecute his appeal.  It is therefore dismissed for want of prosecution.

Solicitors:  Grey Kelly Law, Wellington, Applicant     [1] In my judgment of 3 November 2014, I invited counsel for the applicant to submit a memorandum addressing the need for the application for the relief sought in paragraph (b) of the statement of claim, ordering that the powers of appointment, removal and replacement of trustees, presently contained in paragraph 10 of the Trust Deed, be vested in the trustees from time to time of the Trust.1  I sought further elaboration from counsel about the need for such variation, having regard to the powers in s 43 of the Trustee Act 1956.     [2] Mr Kelly for the applicant has filed a helpful memorandum.  He explains that the application has been sought because it is considered that the powers in s 43 may not be adequate to address the long term administration of the Trust.  The long term disability of the settlor means that the powers in cl 10 are not likely to be available during his lifetime.  The power in s 43 is more limited than the power in cl 10 of the Trust Deed.     [3] With Mr Kelly’s explanation, I consider that it is appropriate to vary the power of appointment during the lifetime of the settlor, Mr Lance.  However, as Mr Kelly’s memorandum rightly recognises, my reservations about granting the order related principally to the change which the proposed order would make to the power of appointment following Mr Lance’s death.  That power, under cl 10, is vested in Mr Lance’s personal representative.  Mr Kelly’s memorandum suggests that the practical implications of the change may not be significant.  However, he suggests as an alternative that the Court might limit the variation of the powers in cl 10 to the lifetime of the settlor only.     [4] In the circumstances, I consider that is the better course.  I make an order in terms of paragraph (b) of the prayer for relief, amended by adding, after the words “[o]rders that”, the words “during the lifetime of Grahame Hubert Lance”.    1  Lance v Lance [2014] NZHC 2725.          “A D MacKenzie J”  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND NELSON REGISTRY CIV 2014-442-77 [2014] NZHC 2824  UNDER Part 19 of the High Court Rules and s 52 of the Trustee Act 1956  IN THE MATTER of an application for removal of an incapacitated trustee and vesting of land in the remaining trustees  BETWEEN JOHN HAMISH FALCONER BROWN and ANNA HARRIET BROWN as Trustees of the J H F and A H Brown Family Trusts Applicants  AND DENNIS EDWARD CREED Respondent  In Chambers: On papers  Judgment: 13 November 2014  JUDGMENT OF THE HON JUSTICE KÓS  [1] The applicants are two of the three trustees of the J H F and A H Brown Family Trust (Trust). The Trust was established by Deed on 11 July 2001.  The third trustee is the respondent, Mr Creed.  He is a retired solicitor.  [2] The trustees are the registered proprietors of a property at 56A Polygon Road, St Heliers, Auckland. It is to be sold by auction next Wednesday, 19 November 2014.  [3] Sadly, the third trustee, Mr Creed, is now permanently incapacitated. Filed in support of this application is an affidavit from Dr Charles Riley, a medical  BROWN & ANOR as Trustees of the J H F and A H Brown Family Trusts v CREED [2014] NZHC 2824 [13 November 2014]  practitioner in Nelson. He deposes that Mr Creed is no longer mentally capable of making decisions regarding his health, welfare, property and affairs. He suffers from dementia. An order has been made for his compulsory treatment as an in-patient at a rest home facility in Nelson.   [4] The application before me seeks:  (a)  An order dispensing with service of this application on the respondent; and   (b)  an order that the property described as an estate in fee simple as to one half share in Lot 15 Deposited Plan 18034 and an estate in lease hold in respect of Flat 2, Deposited Plan 100354 and being the interest described in Certificate of Title NA54C/1249 North Auckland Land Registration District be vested in John Hamish Falconer Brown and Anna Harriet Brown, the applicants.    [5] The Deed provides that the trustees be not less than two in number. It contains a power to appoint a new trustee in substitution for an existing trustee. Or to appoint additional trustees.  The power is vested in Mr and Mrs Brown.  [6] The power in the Deed has not been exercised. Mr Brown has deposed he and his wife do not wish to appoint a further trustee.  [7] In the circumstances, and given the imminent sale, I accept that it is appropriate to now make a vesting order in accordance with s 52 of the Trustee Act 1956. I am also satisfied that Mr Creed’s unfortunate circumstances are such that service on him should be dispensed with.   Result  [8] There will be orders in accordance with [4] above. Costs will be met from the funds of the trust.   Stephen K J  Solicitors: Pitt & Moore, Nelson for Applicants

[2] In my decision dated 17 September 2014 I dismissed the application. 1  [3] The second and third defendants now seek costs on a category 2 band B basis. Mr Cooke has not filed any submissious, advising the Court that he considers such an exercise would be futile.  [4] I have considered the memorandum of counsel for the second and third defendants. I am satisfied the costs sought have beeu calculated pursuant to the appropriate High Court Rules, analogous with general civil proceedings. I note that as the second and third defendants had shared representation only one set of costs has been claimed.  [5] I am satisfied that costs on a 2B basis are appropriate and an award is made for the sum of $13,731 as sought.   Thomas J  Cooke v Real Estate Agents Disciplinary 7i'ibunal [2014] NZHC 2254.

REASONS  The application  [1] Mr Reekie is seeking leave to appeal against a decision of O’Regan P declining to review the decision of the Registrar of the Court of Appeal refusing to waive securityfor costs and fixing securityat $5,880.1  Reekie v Attorney-General [2014] NZCA374.  NICHOLAS PAULALFRED REEKIE vATTORNEY-GENERAL(sued onbehalfofthe Department of Corrections) [2014] NZSC 161[11 November 2014]  [2] O’Regan P considered that Mr Reekie’s appeal is “one where the benefits to be obtained are substantially outweighed by the costs of the exercise”.2 This meant that it was not an appropriate case for dispensing with securityfor costs.3   The underlying appeal  [3] The underlying appeal is against a costs judgment of Wylie J dated 24 October 2012.4 The costs decision relates to a substantive claim alleging false imprisonment and unlawful treatment in Mr Reekie’s conditions of imprisonment in 2002 and 2003.5  [4] In his costs judgment, Wylie J awarded Mr Reekie $1,000 towards the costs incurred for counsel’s fees in preparing the original statement of claim.6 Wylie J did not allow Mr Reekie to recover for anyother claimed disbursements as the Judge did not accept these were incurred by Mr Reekie personally and/or that they were properly claimed.   Our assessment  [5] The proposed appeal to this Court does not involve a matter of general or public importance and there is no substantial miscarriage of justice. O’Regan P applied the principles set out bythis Court in Reekie v Attorney-General.7  [6] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CIV-2014-404-1055 [2014] NZHC 2793  BETWEEN D A S  Appellant   AND  G E   Respondent   Hearing:  On the papers   Counsel:  H Brown forAppellant A C Wright for Respondent   Judgment:  11 November 2014    JUDGMENT OF KATZ J (Costs)  This judgment was delivered by me on 11 November 2014 at 4:00 pm Pursuant to Rule 11.5 High Court Rules  Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors: Rennie CoxLawyers,Auckland AlastairWright, Auckland  D AS vGE [2014] NZHC 2793 [10 November 2014]  Introduction  [1] On 2 May 2014 the appellant filed a notice of appeal against orders made by Judge Burns in the FamilyCourt at Auckland on 3April 2014.  [2] On 21 May 2014 the parties to the appeal filed a joint memorandum, seeking various orders. Those orders were made by Ellis J on 23 May 2014, by consent. They included an order that the appellant pay security for costs in the sum of $1,240 no later than ten working days after 27 May 2014. Those security for costs were not paid. Accordingly, when the matter was called in the appeals list before me on 29 July 2014, I queried whether the appeal was still on foot or had been deemed abandoned pursuant to s 74(2) of the District Courts Act 1947. The parties sought time to consider that issue and the matter was adjourned accordingly.  [3] The appellant subsequently filed a memorandum advising that she did not seek to take her appeal any further. The respondent filed a memorandum in response, noting that he had been put to the time and trouble of responding to the appeal and accordingly sought the costs of his wasted attendances. By minute dated 12 August 2014, I expressed the preliminary view that, as the appeal had been abandoned, the respondent was entitled to costs on a category 2B basis. If costs could not be agreed based on that preliminary indication, leave was reserved to file memoranda.  [4] Costs were not agreed. The respondent accordingly filed a memorandum on 2 October 2014, seeking costs on a category 2B basis, in the sum of $3,980. I directed that any memorandum by the appellant in response was to be filed by 3November 2014.  Nomemorandum has been received.  [5] I am satisfied that the costs sought by the respondent are appropriate and have been calculated in accordancewith the High Court Rules. Iaccordinglyorder that the appellant is to meet the respondent’s costs in relation to the appeal in the sum of $3,980, together with disbursements as fixed by the Registrar (if any).  Katz J 
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CIV-2014-404-2534 [2014] NZHC 2783  BETWEEN SAFEWAY SCAFFOLDING (NZ) LIMITED Plaintiff  AND NOELENE FAYE DAVIS Defendant  Hearing: On the papers  Appearances: R Hawk for plaintiff No appearance for defendant (no steps taken)  Judgment: 10 November 2014  JUDGMENT OF LANG J [by formal proof]  This judgment was delivered by me on 10 November 2014 at 4 pm, pursuant to Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules.  Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date……………  SAFEWAYSCAFFOLDING(NZ) LTD vDAVIS [2014] NZHC 2783[10 November 2014]  [1] This proceeding was served on the defendant on 1 October 2014, but to date she has taken no steps to defend the plaintiff’s claim. The time for filing a defence expired on 5 November 2014. The plaintiff now asks the Court to deal with its claim by way of formal proof.  [2] Formal proof evidence has been filed in the form of an affidavit by Mr Frederick Mansell dated 6 November 2014. Mr Mansell outlines the circumstances giving rise to the claim. Having read his affidavit, I am satisfied that the defendant has misappropriated not less than $805,184.24 from the plaintiff. She did so by convertingcheques she received on the plaintiff’s behalf to her own use.   [3] The plaintiff accepts that the amount for which judgment is to be entered should be reduced by the sum of $1,225.78, being the credit balance currently standing in the social club account formerly operated by the defendant. I therefore enter judgment in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant in the sum of $803,963.61 together with costs on a Category 2B basis and disbursements as fixed by the Registrar.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OFNEWZEALAND  SC 72/2014  [2014] NZSC 159   BETWEEN  RAZDAN RAFIQ Applicant   AND  GOOGLE NEW ZEARespondent  LAND LIMITED    Court: McGrath, William Young and Glazebrook JJ Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment: 6 November 2014  JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  The application for recall of the Court’s judgment is dismissed.   REASONS  [1] Mr Rafiq seeks recall of our judgment refusing leave to appeal1 on the basis that the Court was wrong to award costs against him, in favour of Google, when it dismissed Mr Rafiq’s leave application.   [2] The basis for the recall application is that the respondent did not seek costs.  The onlyrelief sought by the respondent was refusal of leave to appeal.  [3] Rule 44 of the Supreme Court Rules 2004 gives the Court discretion to “make any order that seems just” in relation to the costs of an application for leave to appeal. The availability of the Court’s discretion does not depend on whether the respondent applies for an order as to costs. In awarding costs in this matter, the Court exercised this discretion in favour of the respondent. The present application  Rafiq v Google New Zealand Ltd [2014] NZSC 126.  RAZDAN RAFIQ v GOOGLE NEWZEALAND LIMITED [2014] NZSC 159[6 November 2014]  does not set out any basis on which the Court can recall its judgment. The application for recall is dismissed.

He came up for sentence before Judge McDonald on 17 June 2014.1 The Judge also had before him an application by a probation officer to cancel an existing sentence ofhome detention and to impose imprisonment. 2  [2] Judge McDonald imposed a period of nine months imprisonment to reflect the balance of the home detention sentence that he cancelled. On the burglary charges to which Mr Hokai had pleaded guilty, he was sentenced to one year four months imprisonment, cumulative on the nine months imposed in substitution for the home detention sentence. Sentences of one year four months imprisonment and six months imprisonment were imposed concun-ently on the remaining charges. The Judge imposed an end sentence of one of two years and three months imprisonment.  [3] Mr Hokai appealed against the sentence imposed. It is agreed that the Judge made a mathematical en-or in the computation of the sentences imposed. While, individually, there was no en-or, the correct end sentence ought to have been one of two years and one month's imprisonment.  [4] As the appeal is designed only to correct the end sentence, the Police do not oppose. I consider it is preferable that the end sentence be amended to avoid any risk that its current expression may disadvantage Mr Hokai inappropriately.  [5] The appeal against sentence is allowed, to the extent that the correct end sentence to be imposed shall be recorded as one of two years and one month's imprisonment. No adjustment to individual sentences is required.  ~s:d  PRHeathJ  Delivered at 2.00pm on 3 November 2014  Police v Hokai DC Whangarei CRl-2014-088-001168, 17 June 2014, Sentencing Act 2002, s 80F.  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV 2014-485-202 [2014] NZHC 2703  BETWEEN BRENDON DOUGLAS FORREST Plaintiff  AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS Defendant  On the papers  Judgment: 31 October 2014  JUDGMENT OF MALLON J (Costs)  [1] I refer to my judgment dated 29 July 2014.1 The judgment was silent on the issue of costs. Costs were sought in the interlocutory application but not mentioned in the submissions. The defendant has since filed a memorandum seeking costs of $6,775.09 (calculated on a 2B basis). The plaintiff does not oppose costs in principle. He queries the appropriateness of claiming for some of the steps that  make up the defendant’s calculation.  He proposes that the Court order the lesser sum  of $2,550 which he would pay off once he is released from prison.  [2] Although the defendant succeeded and the general principle is that the unsuccessful party pays costs, 2 I consider it is not appropriate to make any order in this case. I acknowledge that costs orders can be made against serving prisoners.  However costs orders, like reparation orders, may impose unrealistic burdens on them which do nothing to assist their rehabilitation when they are released.  Consequently reparation orders are frequently not made if a person is to be sentenced to imprisonment.   1 Forrest v Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2014] NZHC 1780. 2 High Court Rules, rr 14.2 and 14.8;  FORREST v THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS [2014] NZHC 2703 [31 October 2014]  [3] In this case Mr Forrest was bringing a claim under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. It concerned the clothing prisoners are required to wear for prisoner visits. Although the claim was struck out because it could not succeed, it cannot be said that it concerned a trifling matter. Certainly there was nothing about  Mr Forrest’s conduct that indicated he was anything other than genuinely concerned  about the issue. He conducted his claim in a proper manner: his pleadings were carefully framed, he was responsibly cooperative in relation to the interlocutory steps, and his written and oral submissions were focussed on the issues.3  [4] In these circumstances, I consider that it is not appropriate to saddle him with the burden of a substantial costs order, which he will need to pay off over time when he is released, when his efforts should be focussed on rehabilitation and integration.4 The claim for costs is therefore declined.

REASONS  [1] By application filed on 1 October 2014 the appellant seeks a review of the DeputyRegistrar’s decision of 30 September 2014 not to provide to the appellant the details he had requested as to payment or waiver of filing fees for the second respondent in this appeal.  [2] The application for review is opposed by the second respondent, in a memorandum filed on 6 October by her counsel.  NR V DISTRICTCOURTATAUCKLAND CA461/2014 [2014] NZCA514[28 October 2014]  [3] Havingreviewed the Registrar’s decision, I uphold it.  My reasons are  (a)  The information sought relates to the administration of the Court, and is thus not a “document” or part of the “court file” in terms of r 6(1) of the Court of Appeal (Access to Court Documents) Rules 2009 (the Rules). The definition of “document” for the purposes of the Rules is found in r 3, and expressly excludes “any material that relates to the administration of the court”. The definition of “court file” is “a collection of documents that relate to an appeal and are in the custody or control of the court”.  The information sought by the appellant does not fall within that definition for the same reason that it is not a “document”.   (b)  If I am wrong in the conclusion expressed in (a), and the request was properlymade under r 6(1) of the Rules, then I direct under r 6(3) that the information requested by the appellant not be made available to him or any lawyer he mayinstruct.  I do that because theappellant has no legitimate interest in obtaining the information. It has no relevance to his ability to advance his appeal or defend the cross-appeal.    [4] In the result, the application for review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision is dismissed.  Solicitors: WilsonHarle,Auckland for Second Respondent  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OFNEWZEALAND  SC 86/2014  [2014] NZSC 152   BETWEEN  VINCENT ROSS SIEMER Applicant   AND  JUDICIAL CONDUCT COMMISSIONER First Respondent   RODNEY HANSEN Second Respondent   DAVID HARVEY Third Respondent    Court: McGrath, Glazebrook and O'Regan JJ Counsel: Applicant in Person Judgment: 24 October 2014  JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  The application for recall of this Court’s judgment [2014] NZSC 138 is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] Mr Siemer seeks recall of this Court’s judgment1 dealing with his application for leave to appeal against a decision ofWhite J dated 30 July 2014.2  [2] The application is advanced on the basis that the Court’s reasoning for its decision to dismiss the application for leave is not adequately set out in the leave judgment.   1 Siemer v Judicial Conduct Commissioner [2014] NZSC138. 2 Siemer v Judicial Conduct Commissioner [2014] NZCA358.  VINCENTROSS SIEMER vJUDICIALCONDUCTCOMMISSIONER [2014] NZSC 152[24 October 2014]  [3] Section 16(2) of the Supreme Court Act 2003 provides that the Court’s reasons for refusing to give leave to appeal “may be stated briefly, and may be stated in general terms only”. That is the approach that was followed in the leave judgment.  [4] None of the grounds which would normally justify the recall of a judgment has been identified in the application.  It is therefore dismissed. 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND SC 82/2014 [2014] NZSC 151  BETWEEN JONATHAN DIXON Applicant  AND THE QUEEN Respondent  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is granted.  B The approved question is whether the Court of Appeal erred when it dismissed the appeal.  [1] Theapproved question encompasses whether the Court ofAppeal was correct to hold that the CCTV files are not property, as well as the question of whether the Court of Appeal should have used s 386(2) of the Crimes Act 1961 to substitute a conviction for accessing a computer system and thereby dishonestly and without claim of right obtaining a benefit.1  [2] Mr Dixon also sought leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the submissions filed by Mr Dixon after the Court ofAppeal hearing were “outside the scope of the leave granted” and that they did not individually or collectively justify quashing the conviction.2  1 Dixon v R [2014] NZCA329, [2014] 3 NZLR 504 (Harrison,Wild and FrenchJJ). 2 At [61].

IN THE SUPREME COURT OFNEWZEALAND  SC 68/2014  [2014] NZSC 148   BETWEEN  RHYS MICHAEL CULLEN Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent    Court: McGrath, William Young and Arnold JJ Counsel: Applicant in Person  J Mildenhall for Respondent Judgment: 22October 2014  JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is granted (Cullen v R [2014] NZCA 325).  B The approved question is whether the Court of Appeal was correct to dismiss Mr Cullen’s appeal.  REASONS  [1] Without narrowing the scope of the approved ground of appeal, the Court wishes the parties to address the following matters in the course of their argument:  (a)  Can the actions and states of mind of the employees other than the appellant be attributed to Tamaki Metals Ltd as to (i) possession, and   (ii) recklessness?   (b)  For the purposes of s 246 of the Crimes Act 1961, at what point was “the act of receiving” byTamaki Metals Ltd complete?    RHYS MICHAELCULLEN v R [2014] NZSC 148[22 October 2014]  (c) For the purposes of s 246(3) of the Crimes Act, can there be more than one “act of receiving” by the same offender in relation to the same property?  [2] Although the Court will not formally review the correctness of the Court of Appeal’s judgment in Cullen v R [2012] NZCA 413, the parties are not restricted in their arguments by the assumption that it was correctly decided.

         IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND           [2014] NZSC 150       BETWEEN     MEDHI JAFFARI AND TRACY JAFFARI  Applicants      AND     LIVIA GRABOWSKI  Respondent                                                 Counsel:     Applicants in person      Judgment:     22 October 2014         JUDGMENT OF McGRATH J ON REVIEW OF REFUSAL TO WAIVE FILING FEE    The filing fee is waived.  ____________________________________________________________________      REASONS  [1] The applicants, Mr and Mrs Jaffari, had judgment entered against them in the New South Wales District Court in favour of Mrs Grabowski as executrix of her mother’s estate.  Judgment on liability was entered for AUD 186,480.83.  Subsequently judgment was also entered for costs of AUD 73,077.37.   [2] The liability judgment was registered in the High Court of New Zealand under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act 1934.  The applicants applied to the High Court to set aside the New South Wales liability judgment.  The High Court refused that application and also gave Mrs Grabowski leave to register the costs    judgment.1  The High Court decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal.2  The applicants now wish to bring a further appeal to this Court.   [3] The present matter concerns the refusal of the Acting Registrar to waive fees on the filing of the application for leave to appeal.  The applicants have sought a review by a judge of that decision under s 40 of the Supreme Court Act 2003.   [4] The only arguable ground under which the filing fee can be waived in this case is that under reg 5(3)(b)(iii) of the Supreme Court Fees Regulations 2003.  The ground is that if the fee were not waived the applicant “would … suffer undue hardship if he or she paid the fee”.   [5] The regulation requires not only that payment of the fee would cause financial hardship but that hardship would be “undue”, which means excessive.  The applicants say their situation qualifies because their income is sporadic (coming from seasonal homestay board and their modest leech therapy business).  They have credit card debt of $25,000.  They say a statement by the Acting Registrar that they have income of $1,000 a week is wrong.   [6] The applicants’ bank statements indicate that loan repayments are their biggest outgoings.  There is no obvious pattern of substantial outgoings which are unexplained.   [7] I am satisfied that the applicants’ financial position is precarious.  If the fee is not waived they will go further into debt in order to pay it.  I consider the hardship they would suffer in those circumstances is such as qualifies as undue under the Regulations.   [8] For these reasons on review of the Registrar I waive the filing fee in this case.    1  Grabowski v Jaffari [2013] NZHC 3417.  2  Jaffari v Grabowski [2014] NZCA 399.        
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 89/2014 [2014] NZSC 149   BETWEEN  KUNG WE CHAN Applicant   AND  DILWORTH TRUST BOARD Respondent   Court:  William Young,Arnold and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person C E Harris for Respondent   Judgment:  21 October 2014    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant is to pay the respondent costs of $2,500 and reasonable disbursements to be fixed by the Registrar.    REASONS  [1] In a reserved judgment delivered on 20 March 2012, Associate Judge Sargisson granted summary judgment as to liability against the applicant in respect of his guarantee of the obligations of a tenant under a lease from the respondent.1 The time for filing an appeal expired on 17 April 2012. On 14 February 2014, the applicant applied to the Court of Appeal under r 29A of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005 for an extension of time to bring an appeal.  Dilworth Trust Board v Jack’s Ventures Ltd HC Auckland CIV-2011-404-3312, 20 March 2012 at [40].  KUNGWE CHAN v DILWORTH TRUSTBOARD [2014] NZSC149 [21 October 2014]  [2] In the judgment now under challenge, the Court of Appeal refused an extension.2 It saw the delay – approximately 22 months – as significant and inadequately explained.3 It was also of the view that the proposed appeal lacked merit.4  [3] Under r 29A, the Court of Appeal was required to exercise discretion. The arguments advanced bythe applicant do not disclose anyapparent error in the wayin which the Court of Appeal approached its task. We have also considered the judgment of the Associate Judge and see no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.  The proposed appeal does not involve any question of public or general importance. Accordingly the application for leave to appeal must be dismissed.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  CA474/2014 [2014] NZCA 499  BETWEEN  RAZDAN RAFIQ Appellant   AND  MEDIAWORKS TV LIMITED First Respondent   AND  MI9 NEW ZEALAND LIMITED Second Respondent   Counsel:  Appellant in person BThomson for Respondents   Judgment:  14 October 2014 at 11 am    (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OFHARRISON J (Review of Registrar’s Decision)  A The application to review the Registrar’s decision refusing to dispense with security for costs is dismissed.  B The appellant is topay the sum of $5,880.00 by way ofsecurity for costs on or before 27 October 2014.  REASONS  [1] On 21 August 2014 the appellant, Razdan Rafiq, pre-emptively applied to review a decision made by the Registrar on 22 September, declining his application to dispense with security for costs on this appeal in Rafiq v MediaWorks.1 She directed the security be set at $5,880.00 and be paid on or before 20 October 2014.  Rafiq v MediaWorks TV Ltd [2014] NZHC 1699.  RAFIQ V MEDIAWORKSTV LIMITED CA424/2014[2014] NZCA499 [14 October 2014]  [2] While it is doubtful whether Mr Rafiq is able to apply for a review of the Registrar’s decision before that decision has even been made, I am prepared to treat what is before me as such an application.  [3] The Registrar properly considered that security for costs should not be dispensed with if a reasonable and solvent litigant would not proceed with the appeal, having regard to the benefits of bringing the appeal weighed against the costs. In particular, she correctly determined there were no exceptional circumstances justifying dispensation. Impecuniositydoes not suffice. Furthermore, this appeal does not raise an issue of public importance or significance.   [4] The Registrar was also entitled to give weight to the conclusions of Faire J, whose judgment is the subject of Mr Rafiq’s underlying claim, that his application to seek summary judgment against MediaWorks is flawed, unlikely to succeed and overall a weak application at best. She was also entitled to consider the fact that MrRafiq has chosen not to apply for legal aid (despite claiming impecuniosity), which would have seen his claim subjected to assessments based on merit and costs against benefits.  [5] I am independently satisfied that it would not be right to require MediaWorks to defend the judgment under challenge without the usual protection as to costs provided by security.2 The application to review is dismissed. Mr Rafiq must pay the sum of $5,880.00 byway of security for costs on or before 27 October 2014.

B The appellant is topay the sum of $5,880.00 by way ofsecurity for costs on or before 3 November2014.  REASONS  [1] On 8 September 2014 the appellant, Razdan Rafiq, pre-emptively applied to review a decision made by the Registrar on 6 October, declining his application to dispense with securityfor costs on this appeal in Rafiq v Secretary for Department of Internal Affairs of New Zealand.1 She directed the security be set at $5,880.00 and be paid on or before 3 November2014.

[3] The Registrar properly considered that security for costs should not be dispensed with if a reasonable and solvent litigant would not proceed with the appeal, having regard to the benefits of bringing the appeal weighed against the costs. She was entitled to consider the sheer volume of unmeritorious proceedings brought by Mr Rafiq as well as the views of a number of Judges, presiding over other litigation brought by him, that Mr Rafiq’s efforts are an abuse of procedure brought to vex and harass the various respondents. She properly concluded it would not be right to require the Secretary for the Department of Internal Affairs to defend the judgment under challenge without the usual protection as to costs provided by security.2  [4] She could have added that there are no exceptional circumstances justifying dispensation in this case. Impecuniosity does not suffice. Furthermore, this appeal does not raise an issue of public importance or significance. The application to reviewis dismissed.

[2] The points raised by Mr Rafiq are not new, with one exception.  The exception is that Mr Rafiq alleges that the Court:    1  Rafiq v Chief Executive of Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [2014] NZSC 72.  … failed to consider that the review of the registrar’s decision not to dispense with security for costs was not presided by a panel of 3 Judges including the President of the Court of Appeal.  This has prejudiced the outcome of the Court of Appeal’s decision.  [3] However, there is clear statutory authority for a single Judge of the Court of Appeal to review a decision of the Registrar as to security for costs: see s 61A(3) of the Judicature Act 1908 and rule 7(2) of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005.   [4] Accordingly, the application for recall is dismissed.                    Solicitors:   Crown Law Office, Wellington for Respondents SC 19/2014  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 79/2014 [2014] NZSC 136   BETWEEN  KATHRYN FRANCES BOSWELL Applicant   AND  OWEN ROSS MILLAR Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, William Young and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person S J Chatwin for Respondent   Judgment:  7 October 2014    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant is to pay the respondent costs of $2,500 and reasonable disbursements.    REASONS  [1] These proceedings arose out of the settlement of a dispute between the applicant and the late Mr Owen Millar about an option to purchase in favour of the applicant over part of a property owned by Mr Millar over which the applicant had a lease. Under the settlement agreement, the applicant was to purchase the land in dispute but this required the issue of a separate title which required either a resource consent for a subdivision or a boundary adjustment. The agreement provided for the parties to co-operate in applying for a subdivision consent but that if one could not be obtained, the transaction would proceed, at the applicant’s option, as a boundary adjustment.   KATHRYN FRANCES BOSWELLvOWEN ROSS MILLAR [2014] NZSC 136[7 October 2014]  [2] Relevantly in issue in the High Court1 and Court of Appeal2 were claims by the applicant involving:  (a)  An alleged breach byMrMillar ofhis dutyto co-operate in relation to the subdivision consent application;   (b)  The applicant’s contention that when Mr Millar entered the settlement agreement he knew that a subdivision consent would not be obtained;   (c)  Claims for damages to recover the applicant’s costs in relation to the resolution of other disputes in respect of the settlement agreement which had been settled; and   (d)  A claim fora refund of rent paid of $5,250.    Aclaim by Mr Millar for interest or rent on the purchase price was dismissed by the Judge in the High Court and was not the subject of an appeal to the Court of Appeal.  [3] On the four primary issues in the case, the applicant was unsuccessful in both the High Court and Court of Appeal. In relation to the first two, this was substantially on the facts.3 In respect of the third, both Courts applied the well-established rule that in general legal costs incurred in relation to disputes are not able to be recovered as damages. The fourth claim required an interpretation of the lease and settlement agreement.  Both Courts resolved that issue against the applicant.  [4] The case arises out of very particular contractual arrangements. There is no point of public or general commercial importance involved. As well, the applicant’s arguments have received thorough consideration in both the High Court and Court of Appeal and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors/Counsel: Crown Law, Wellington. J Boyack, Auckland.  SWITZERLAND v SOOSAIPILLAI (AKA SINGARAJAH) [2014] NZHC 2417 [2 October 2014]  [l] The applicant appeals an order granting bail to the respondent.  [2] I note that the Crown does not appeal the substantive decision of Judge Sharp granting bail. That decision is accepted by the Crown before me and the only issue raised is the District Court's lack of jurisdiction to impose a surety. The appeal therefore is in fact an application to this Court to correct a technical error.  [3] It is common ground between the applicant and respondent that as a condition of granting bail the District Comi Judge required the respondent to provide a surety of $25,000 when the District Comi has no jurisdiction to impose such a surety.1 The High Court has inherent jurisdiction to impose a condition of bail that the respondent provide a surety.2  [4] I observe that the limitation ofjurisdiction was not pointed out to the District Court Judge.  [5] The applicant and respondent consent to an order allowing the appeal, but granting the respondent bail on the same conditions as ordered in the District Court including the order that the respondent provide a surety of $25,000.  Result  [6] The appeal is allowed insofar as the order that the respondent provide a surety of $25,000 is quashed.  [7] This Court makes an order adding a condition to the grant of bail that the respondent provide a surety of$25,000.  :.?.

PUBLICATION IN LAW REPORT OR LAW DIGEST PERMITTED.  IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY  CRI-2013-092-13289 [2014] NZHC 2387   BETWEEN  ZIGENG MA Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Hearing:  30 September 2014    Appearances: STait and J M Hudson forApplicant A J Pollett for Respondent  Judgment: 30 September 2014  JUDGMENT OF BREWER J  Solicitors: S Tait (Manukau)forApplicant MeredithConnell (Auckland) for Respondent  MAv R [2014] NZHC 2387[30September 2014]  [1] Mr Ma has been on bail since 6 December 2013, on serious drugs charges.  He and others are due to stand trial commencing 13 April 2015.   [2] Initially Mr Ma’s bail was on the condition he observe a 24 hour curfew.  This was later relaxed to enable him to leave the bail address between 7.00 am and  7.00 pm on Sundays. Mr Ma is the father of young children and the relaxation provided him with some ability to inter-act with his children outside the bail address.  [3] Mr Ma now applies for a further relaxation of his curfew. He wishes to be permitted to leave the bail address from 7.00 am until 8.00 pm daily.  This will serve two purposes. The first is to better enable him to perform paternal functions. The second is to enable him to look for work.  [4] The Crown does not oppose the relaxation of the curfew. Ms Pollett has made inquiries with the officer in charge of the case who has confirmed that there have been no breaches of bail by Mr Ma. Ms Pollett tells me that the officer in charge “is relaxed” at the prospect of the bail variation.   [5] For my part I take into account that Mr Ma is a New Zealand citizen and I understand from the material before me why the opportunity to earn an extra income for the family is necessary. His history of complying with very restrictive bail conditions from December of last year, gives me some confidence that the risk of flight is attenuated.   [6] Accordingly, I grant the application for variation of bail. The curfew is now relaxed so that Mr Ma may be absent from the bail address between 7.00 am and  8.00 pm daily. This global condition replaces the previous relaxation which applied only to Sundays.  Brewer J 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND SC 9/2013 [2014] NZSC 134  BETWEEN  JOHN ANTHONY OSBORNE AND HELEN OSBORNE Appellants   AND  AUCKLAND COUNCIL First Respondent   THE WEATHERTIGHT HOMES TRIBUNAL Second Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, McGrath, William Young, Glazebrook and Tipping JJ   Counsel:  T J Rainey and J P Wood for Appellants K L Clark QC and C R Goode for First Respondent K M Muller for Second Respondent M J Andrews and P Ieong for Attorney-General as Intervener   Judgment:  29 September 2014    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT AS TO FURTHER RELIEF  A Application for further relief declined.  B No order for costs.    REASONS  (Given by William Young J)  [1] In the principal judgment delivered on 10 June 2014, the Court reserved leave to apply for further relief. Mr Rainey has now applied for further relief which is related not to the circumstances of the Osbornes but rather to those of other claimants. In particular he drew our attention to two instances where homeowners have sought reconsideration in light of our principal judgment of decisions that their claims were ineligible made either by the chief executive or, on review, by the chair  JOHN ANTHONY OSBORNE AND HELEN OSBORNE v AUCKLAND COUNCIL [2014] NZSC 134 [29 September 2014]  of the Tribunal. Sections 13 and 16 of the Interpretation Act 1999 arguably provide for such reconsideration but to date both the chief executive and the chair of the Tribunal have declined to review the earlier decisions.  On the basis of their stance, it will be necessary for affected homeowners to seek separately, in the High Court, judicial review of the earlier eligibility decisions.  [2] With the consent of the parties, we may have been prepared to address the question whether ss 13 and 16 of the Interpretation Act 1999 permit reconsideration of the kind proposed by Mr Rainey. It is a discrete legal issue, the determination of which is not affected by the facts of particular cases.  That consent, however, has not been forthcoming. And in the absence of such consent it would not be appropriate, even if it were jurisdictionally possible, for this Court to address, for the benefit of parties other than the appellants, decisions which were not in issue in the High Court and Court of Appeal and in fact post-date our principal judgment.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA76/2014 [2014] NZCA 472  BETWEEN MORGAN NICK HOY Appellant AND THE QUEEN Respondent Hearing: 24 September 2014 Court: Harrison, Goddard and Venning JJ Counsel: L PFLafferty forAppellant S K Barr for Respondent Judgment: 26 September 2014 at 10.30 am   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for an extension of time to appeal is granted.  B The appeal against sentence is dismissed.    REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Harrison J)  [1] Morgan Hoy was found guilty along with others following a trial in the Wellington District Court on 11 counts relating to the supply of methamphetamine over a two week period in early 2012 – in particular, one of conspiring to supply, seven of offering to supply and three of possession for supply. Mr Hoy was convicted and sentenced by the trial Judge, Judge Treston, to three years imprisonment.1 He now applies for an extension of time to appeal his sentence but not his conviction.  The Crown does not oppose his applicationwhich wegrant.  Police v Hoy DC Wellington CRI-2012-085-6837, 6 December 2013.  HOYV RCA76/2014[2014] NZCA472[26 September 2014]  [2] The ground of Mr Hoy’s appeal is that the sentence is manifestly excessive because in fixing the starting point of three years imprisonment (which was also the end sentence) the Judge failed to correctly assess the level of Mr Hoy’s commercial involvement, assumed offending beyond the scope of the charges and did not correctly reflect Mr Hoy’s liability compared to his co-offenders whose culpability was more serious.   [3] The Crown case against Mr Hoy and his co-offenders was based primarily upon evidence of text messages intercepted during a covert investigation into the methamphetamine dealing activities of a syndicate headed by Mr Hoy’s co-offenders. Mr Hoy was identified through his own intercepted communications (about 1,000) with other syndicate members. Judge Treston had the distinct advantage of having heard all the evidence at trial. The Judge was satisfied that MrHoy was a significant participant in the syndicate’s commercial activities; and that he had actually been supplied about two grams of methamphetamine by the syndicate head during the relevant period. On this factual basis, and after taking account of the relevant sentencing principles, the Judge fixed a startingpoint of three years.   [4] Mr Lafferty properly conceded before us that Mr Hoy’s offending fell within the sentencing band of a starting point of two to four years imprisonment fixed in R v Fatu for methamphetamine offending on this scale.2 He was unable to identify any error by the Judge in adopting a starting point in the middle range of that band. We are independently satisfied that a starting point of three years imprisonment was open to the Judge; and we are not satisfied, having regard to the sentences imposed on his co-offenders, that the Judge erred in imposing an end sentence of three years imprisonment on MrHoy.  [5] The appeal against sentence is dismissed.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent  R v Fatu [2006] 2 NZLR 72 (CA) at [34](a).  
         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  MASTERTON REGISTRY    CRI-2012-035-991  [2014] NZHC 2366       THE QUEEN        v        ALLAN IVO GREER       Hearing:     26 September 2014  (Heard at Wellington)      Counsel:      I R Murray for Crown  Defendant in person      Judgment:     26 September 2014         ORAL JUDGMENT OF MACKENZIE J     [1] Before I begin the sentencing, I need to address several matters that Mr Greer has raised.  He has recently filed a 181 page document in which he has made a number of applications.  They have not been made in proper form, but I deal with them to the extent necessary.   [2] The first is an application that I recuse myself from dealing further with this case.  Mr Greer asserts that I am disqualified by having demonstrated bias against him, first in a bail appeal which I heard on an unrelated matter in 2010, which he asserts has led me to conduct his trial in a manner adverse to him.   [3] As the trial Judge, I should sentence Mr Greer unless there are good grounds to recuse myself.  I am satisfied that none of the many matters raised by him justify recusal.  The way I conducted the trial can potentially be raised on an appeal against conviction.  I advised Mr Greer of that in a minute on 16 May 2014, and nothing in    his further papers filed causes me to alter my view that no grounds for recusal are made out.   [4] The application for recusal is accordingly dismissed.   [5] Mr Greer has also made a renewed application for bail.  Bail is out of the question.  That application is dismissed.   [6] Mr Greer has also renewed an application for discharge.  Because the trial proceeded to jury verdicts, I have no power to discharge, or to declare a mistrial as Mr Greer requests.  As I have said, any issues as to the conduct of the trial are a matter for appeal, not for this Court.   [7] Mr Greer has also made requests for documents from the Court file.  I addressed that request in my minute of 10 July 2014.  I am not prepared to make any further order at this stage.   [8] Mr Greer has also made application for an adjournment.  This sentencing has already been delayed.  There is no basis for any further delay.  That application is refused.   [9] I will now proceed with the sentencing.              “A D MacKenzie J”

B The appeal must be lodged within five working days of the date of this judgment.  There will be no order as to costs.  REASONS  AVISON v MCFARLANE CA498/2014 [2014] NZCA 469 [25 September 2014]  [1] The applicant wishes to appeal a decision of Associate Judge Smith delivered in the High Court at Wellington on 12 August 2014.1  [2] The last day for filing a notice of appeal was 9 September 2014.  [3] The application for an extension of time, made under r 29A of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005, was filed on 11 September 2014.  [4] The delay arose out of the need to obtain better instructions from Ms Avison as to whether she wished to pursue an appeal given that the proceedings are still live in the High Court and have not yet been fully determined.  [5] The first and second respondents consent to the application being granted. I am satisfied that it may be dealt with on the papers and that the application should be granted. The delay is minimal, there is a reasonable explanation for the delay and there is no prejudice to the respondents. It is in the interests of justice to grant the application.  [6] The appeal must be lodged within five working days of the date of this judgment.  [7] There will be no order as to costs.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors: MeredithConnell,Auckland.  K vIMMIGRATIONAND PROTECTIONTRIBUNAL[2014] NZHC 2350 [25 September 2014]  [1] On 1 August 2014Idismissed K’s application for leaveto judiciallyreview a decision of the Immigration and Protection Tribunal. I considered that there was no point of public or general importance and that the plaintiff’s case was hopeless. The issues raised were either points of law or meritless and unreasoned factual assertions.1  [2] The second defendant in a memorandum dated 5 August 2014 seeks costs.  The plaintiff has opposed on the basis that he was not legally represented, that awarding costs would subject him to more undue financial hardship, and he asks that the issue of costs be suspended pending consideration of his appeal by the Court of Appeal.  [3] I am not persuaded by these arguments which many unsuccessful litigants could raise. A plaintiff who brings an action and fails is in the ordinary course of events obliged to pay costs, and a lack of legal representation, or a shortage of funds does not displace that.  An appeal does not operate as a stay.  [4] I therefore award the second defendant costs and disbursements as set out in the memorandum of 5 August 2014.  ……………………………..

His appeal against conviction was dismissed by the Court ofAppeal.1 Hedid not seek leave to bring afurther appeal but has sought to challenge his imprisonment by twice applying for writs of habeas corpus. These applications were dismissed by the High Court2 whose decisions were upheld by the Court of Appeal.3 This Court dismissed an application for leave to appeal against that judgment, holding that the habeas corpus applications were misconceived.4  1 Sv R [2013] NZCA179. 2 S v Chief Executive of Department for Corrections [2014] NZHC 1157; and Stevenson v  Attorney-General [2014] NZHC 1232.  3 Stevenson v Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2014] NZCA308.  4 Stevenson v Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2014] NZSC120 at [5].

         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  TIMARU REGISTRY    CIV-2014-485-7172  [2014] NZHC 2266       IN THE ESTATE OF     AVERIL JUNE JOHNSTONE formerly of Geraldine, retired, late of Timaru  Deceased                                   In Chambers:     On papers      Judgment:     18 September 2014         JUDGMENT OF THE HON JUSTICE KÓS      [1] Robert and Gael Johnstone apply under s 31 of the Wills Act 2007 to correct a clerical error in the will of their late mother, Averil Johnstone.  Her will is dated 25 June 2002.  Mrs Johnstone died on 16 May 2014.   [2] Clause 3(b) of Mrs Johnstone’s will provides for the residue of her estate to go to her husband, John Johnstone.  However Mr Johnstone died on 10 March 2012.   [3] In the event of Mr Johnstone pre-deceasing Mrs Johnstone, cl 3(c) of her will provides:    If my wife dies before me to divide the residue equally between my children ROBERT GRAEME JOHNSTONE and GAEL ANNE JOHNSTONE equally if both are living at my death or if only one is living at my death then to that one.  However if one or both of them die before me leaving a child or children living at my death then that child will take or those children will take equally the share which the parent would otherwise have taken under this clause.  [4] In his affidavit Mrs Johnstone’s solicitor, Mr Dorman of Timaru, explains the obvious: the reference to “my wife” is a clerical error.  The reference should have been to “my husband”.  That is, the husband referred to in cl 3(b).    [5] I am satisfied for the purposes of s 31(1) that this correction is necessary to correct a clerical error in the will, in order to carry out Mrs Johnstone’s testamentary intention.   [6] There will be an order amending the word “wife” in cl 3(c) of Mrs Johnstone’s will, to “husband”.        Stephen Kós J            Solicitors:   Gresson Dorman & Co, Timaru

B The applicant is to pay costs of $2,500 plus all reasonable disbursements (to be fixed, if necessary, by the Registrar) to the respondent.  REASONS  [1] Mr Rafiq applies for leave to appeal against a decision of Harrison J, dismissing his application for review of the decision of the Registrar of the Court of Appeal refusing to waive security for costs.1  [2] The underlying appeal to the Court of Appeal is in respect of an order for security for costs made against Mr Rafiq by Associate Judge Doogue in the High Court.2  1 Rafiq v Google New Zealand Limited [2014] NZCA320. 2 Rafiq v Google New Zealand Limited [2014] NZHC 551.  RAZDAN RAFIQ v GOOGLE NEWZEALAND LIMITED [2014] NZSC 126[17 September 2014]  [3] The High Court proceeding is a defamation claim against Google New Zealand in respect of search results returned by the Google Search Service.  MrRafiq claims that the search results lead to a third party website where comments are made about a Human Rights Review Tribunal decision where Mr Rafiq was a party.  [4] There was no error of principle in Harrison J’s approach and there is no risk of a miscarriage of justice.  Further, no issue of general or public importance arises.  [5] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  [6] The applicant is to pay costs of $2,500 plus all reasonable disbursements (to befixed, if necessary, bythe Registrar) to the respondent.

REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by French J)  [1] In a judgment delivered on 24 March 2014, we dismissed Mr Thomas’ application for special leave to appeal.1 The Accident Compensation Corporation did not apply for costs and no costs award was made.  Thomas v Accident Compensation Corporation [2014] NZCA89.  ACCIDENTCOMPENSATION CORPORATION vTHOMAS CA670/2014[2014] NZCA448 [15September 2014]  [2] Mr Thomas then applied for a recall of the judgment. In a subsequent decision we dismissed the application for recall and awarded costs against MrThomas.2  [3] ACC has now applied for costs on the application for special leave.  [4] In our view the application for costs is too late. Costs were not sought at the time.  In our assessment the recall application was in a different category.  [5] The application for costs is accordingly dismissed.  Solicitors: Medico LawLtd,Auckland forApplicant  Thomas v Accident Compensation Corporation [2014] NZCA186.

B Submissions in support of the applications for leave to appeal must be filed on or before 28 November 2014.    REASONS  [1] The applicants seek an extension of time to file submissions in support of the applications for leave to appeal. Dr Fiona Graham also seeks what in effect is a stay in relation to the payment of the fines imposed in the District Court. Dr Graham was fined $24,000 and will be arrested if she returns to New Zealand, as she wishes to do  THE WANAKAGYM LIMITED v QUEENSTOWN LAKES DISTRICTCOUNCIL[2014] NZSC 124[12 September 2014]  for the purpose of preparing submissions in support of the applications for leave to appeal.  She is currently living and working in Japan.  [2] In issue are convictions entered and sentences imposed in the District Court in respect of offending under the Building Act 2004.1 The applicants’ appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed in the High Court.2 Subsequent applications for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal were dismissed by the High Court3 and Court of Appeal.4 There being no right of appeal in respect of the leave decisions, the applicants seek leave to appeal directly to this Court against the judgment of the High Court dismissing their appeals from the District Court. Leave to appeal against the judgment of the High Court will only be granted in exceptional circumstances under s 14 of the Supreme Court Act 2003.  [3] Dr Graham is seeking legal aid for the proposed appeal and I would be prepared to extend the time for filing submissions in any event. The deadline for filing submissions is extended until 28 November 2014.   [4] I am not prepared to issue a stay in relation to the fines. It seems to me that submissions as to whether leave to appeal should be granted should be able to be made based on the judgments of the District Court, High Court and Court ofAppeal.

COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE v REDCLIFFE FORESTRY VENTURE LTD [2014] NZHC 2167 [9 September 2014]  [l] In my decision 11 August 2014 I refused the defendant's application to stay the present proceedings and restrain advertising of them. 1 I indicated that the plaintiff could file a memorandum on costs, which she has done and to which the defendant has replied.  [2] Although the plaintiff has indicated a view that indemnity costs would be justified, she recognises that because there is very little difference between here actual costs and scale costs on a 2B basis, the preferable course is to simply seek costs on a 2B basis.  [3] There is no ground for objection to that (the plaintiff having provided an amended schedule that recognised one objection raised by the defendant). It therefore make an order for costs on a 2B basis in favour of the plaintiff in accordance with Schedule B attached to counsel's memorandum of 5 September 2014.

[2] In her memorandum the Commissioner asserts that she is entitled to indemnity costs under r 14.6(4) but notes that her actual costs are only slightly more than costs calculated on a 2B basis. She seeks only costs calculated on the 2B basis and the defendants do not oppose costs so calculated or the claim for disbursements.  [3] I accordingly make an award of costs in favour of the Commissioner of $15,323 together with disbursements of $2,592.22.

[2] In my judgment I had invited the Commissioner to file a memorandum regarding costs, which she did on 7 August 2014. In that memorandum the Commissioner sought indemnity costs in accordance with r 14.6(4) of the High Court Rules. In doing so, however, she noted that her actual costs were below scale and accordingly sought an order for $10,184.29 together with disbursements of $3,057.63.  [3] The defendants' counsel has indicated his agreement to costs being fixed on that basis. It is proper that they be fixed in this way and I accordingly make an order for costs in favour of the Commissioner in the amount sought.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  AUCKLAND REGISTRY   CIV 2013-404-002685   [2014] NZHC 2151   BETWEEN  KYLE KYLE   Plaintiff   AND  HUAPAI ENTERPRISES LIMITED   First Defendant   DEAN BARRINGTON BENJAMIN   HERRING   Second Defendant    On the papers Judgment: 5 September 2014  JUDGMENT OF ANDREWS J [Costs]  This judgment is delivered by me on 5 September 2014 at 4.45pm pursuant to r 11.5 of the High Court Rules.  ..................................................... Registrar / Deputy Registrar  KYLE vHUAPAI ENTERPRISES LTD &ANOR [2014] NZHC 2151[5 September 2014]  [1] I delivered judgment in this proceeding on 20 August 2014, following a formal proof hearing.1 I ordered that the first defendant company be wound up, and that the second defendant pay compensation to the first defendant in the sum of $341,973. At [20] of the judgment I directed that a memo as to costs be filed within seven days.  [2] Two memoranda have been filed, dated 25 and 28 August 2014. Although counsel for the plaintiff had indicated at the hearing that indemnity costs would be sought against the second defendant, that is not now pursued. The plaintiff seeks costs on a 2B scale in the sum of $36,914.50, together with disbursements totalling $16,378.51.  [3] While r 14.1 of the High Court Rules provides that all matters as to costs are at the discretion of the Court, one of the general principles applicable to the determination of costs is that, pursuant to r 14.2(a), the party who fails in a proceeding should pay costs to the party who succeeds. I am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to an award of costs.  [4] I have reviewed the plaintiff’s claim for costs. With two exceptions, I am satisfied that the claim is properlymadein accordancewith the scaleofcosts. Those exceptions are in relation to preparation for hearing.  At step 31, 2.5 days are allowed for “preparation of issues, authorities, and common bundle”. At step 33, 3 days is allowed for “preparation for hearing”. In the present case, where it was anticipated that there would be no appearance by or on behalf of the defendants, and the hearing itself occupied less than one-quarter of a day, I have concluded that the plaintiff should not be able to claim for the full amounts sought under those two headings. A proper allowance for step 31 is 1 day ($1,990) and 1.5 days ($2,985) for step 33.  [5] By my calculation, that reduces the scale costs to $30,944.50.  [6] Iam satisfied that disbursements of $16,378.51 are properlyclaimed.  Andrews  J  Kyle v Huapai Enterprises Ltd [2014] NZHC 1981.  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CIV-2013-404-004964 [2014] NZHC 2195  INTHE MATTER of the Companies Act 1993  BETWEEN THE COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE Plaintiff  AND OYSTER ENTERTAINMENTLIMITED Defendant  Hearing: 5 September 2014  Appearances: Mr C Van Der Merwe for Commissioner Mr DuaneWichman-Evans -self represented shareholder Mr R Sena for the Official Assignee  Judgment: 5 September 2014  ORAL JUDGMENT OF ASSOCIATE JUDGE J P DOOGUE  THE COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE vOYSTER ENTERTAINMENTLIMITED [2014] NZHC 2195[5 September 2014]  [1] Mr Duane L Wichman-Evans has filed an application seeking an order for termination of Oyster Entertainment Limited which is in liquidation. Essentially he considers that if accounts between the company of which he is a director and the Commissioner could be re-calculated on the basis of fresh returns then there would be no debt to support the continued liquidation and the liquidation could be discharged or annulled.  [2] I have pointed out to Mr Wichman-Evans this morning after discussion with counsel for the Commission of Inland Revenue and the Official Assignee that because that point has not yet been reached (and probably will never be able to be) there is no basis for ending the liquidation. The procedures that directors/shareholders of the company would have to negotiate to get to the point where a reconsideration of the liquidation could be undertaken by the Official Assignee are complex and will cost money. The Inland Revenue is not prepared to re-visit the assessments that underlie the CIR’s debt without financial contribution from a third party (whether Mr Wichman-Evans or someone else). So long as the Official Assignee who is the correct party to take such matters up with the IRD is concerned is not prepared to do so there is little hope, I’m afraid, that the point will ever be reached where the assessments are overturned. That being so it seems almost certain that the existing debt of approximately $200,000 will remain unpaid and that being so there will be no possible basis for a termination of the liquidation of the company. Therefore the application which Duane Leslie Wichman-Evans filed 5 August 2014 is struck-out.  [3] The Commission of Inland Revenue has sought costs on the application. I consider that given the position of the applicant is that he brought proceedings in good faith, albeit mistakenly, that this is a case where exceptionally the discretion of the Court to award costs in favour of the successful party should not be followed. There will be no order for costs.  J.P. Doogue Associate Judge

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CRI-2014-404-000094 [2014] NZHC 2078  BETWEEN TEVITA POHIVA LEAO Appellant  AND AUCKLAND CITY COUNCIL Respondent  Judgment: 29 August 2014  JUDGMENT OF COURTNEY J  This judgment was delivered by Justice Courtney on 29 August 2014 at 4.00 pm pursuant to R 11.5 of the High Court Rules  Registrar / Deputy Registrar  Date………………………..  LEAO v AUCKLAND CITY COUNCIL [2014] NZHC 2078 [29 August 2014]  [1] In my decision 26 August 2014 I allowed Mr Leao’s appeal against the order that his dog Pepper be destroyed. I also indicated that if he were able to produce a medical certificate showing that he was, in fact, unwell on the day of the District Court hearing, which proceeded in his absence, then I would allow his appeal against conviction.  [2] Mr Leao has now provided a copy of the certificate from his doctor showing that he was medically unfit from 6-9 April 2014. The District Court hearing proceeded on 7 April 2014.  In other circumstances I would order a retrial.  However, I do not intend to quash the reparation order that was made so the owners of the dog that Pepper attacked will not be out of pocket. Given all of the other circumstances it seems an unnecessary use of the Court’s resources to order a retrial.  [3] Mr Leao’s appeal against conviction is allowed. The conviction is quashed but the reparation order is unaffected.  P Courtney J 
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND TAURANGA REGISTRY CIV 2013-470-000572 [2014] NZHC 2067  IN THE MATTER  the Family Protection Act 1955   BETWEEN  ALAN WESLEY BRAIN Appellant   AND  CLIVE HARWOOD First Respondent   DAVID CLIVE HARWOOD and ALAN WESLEY BRAIN as Executors of the Will of VIOLET MARY BRAIN Second Respondent    On the papers Judgment: 29 August 2014  COSTS JUDGMENT OF GILBERT J  This judgment is delivered by me on 29 August 2014 at 2 pm pursuant to r 11.5 of the High Court Rules.  ..................................................... Registrar / Deputy Registrar  BRAIN v HARWOOD & ANOR [2014] NZHC 2067 [29 August 2014]  [1] In a judgment delivered on 22 May 2014, I dismissed the appellant’s appeal from a decision of the Family Court at Tauranga which upheld the first respondent’s claim for further provision from their mother’s estate under the Family Protection  Act 1955.   This judgment deals with the issue of costs.  [2] The first respondent seeks indemnity costs contending:  (a)  the appeal had no merit;   (b)  the notice of appeal did not particularise the points on appeal so that these had to be distilled from the written submissions, increasing the preparation time required; and   (c)  the appellant took a “scattergun” approach to the appeal rather than focusing on alleged errors in the judgment.    [3] Alternatively, if the Court is not prepared to award indemnity costs, the first respondent seeks costs calculated on a 2B basis.   [4] The appellant disputes the first respondent’s contentions regarding the wayhe conducted the appeal. He submits that indemnity costs are not appropriate in this case. However, the appellant does not oppose an award of 2B costs and he agrees with the first respondent’s calculation of these.  [5] In my, there is nothing about this case that would warrant a departure from scale costs.  Although I accept that the points raised by the appellant in support of his appeal were wide-ranging and somewhat unfocused, I do not consider that the way he conducted his appeal would justify an award of indemnity costs. Such awards are reserved for exceptional cases.   [6] Accordingly, the first respondent is entitled to costs on the appeal calculated on a 2B basis in accordance with Mr Brittain’s memorandum.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA234/2014 [2014] NZCA 423  BETWEEN  ROBERT FRANK TERRY Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Hearing:  25 August 2014    Court: O'Regan P, Ellen France and Miller JJ Counsel: Applicant in person  M LWong for Respondent Judgment: 28 August 2014 at 12.30 pm   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application is dismissed.    REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Miller J)   Introduction  [1] Mr Terry was charged with using a telephone for the purpose of annoying a person. The complainant was unable to attend the hearing, and a District Court Judge declined the police an adjournment. The police being unable to offer evidence, the prosecution was dismissed.  [2] Mr Terry was refused travel expenses, the Judge noting both that medical reasons explained the complainant’s absence and that the police had earlier told MrTerry they would seek an adjournment.  [3] Mr Terry appealed against the refusal to award travel costs. Mander J dismissed the appeal, having reviewed the matter on the merits.1 He refused leave to appeal.2 Mr Terry now moves this Court for leave.  [4] We agree with Mander J that the proposed appeal raises no question of law that ought to be submitted to this Court for decision, and for the reasons he gave.  The application is dismissed.

REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by O’Regan P)  [1] We heard this appeal yesterday, 21 August 2014.  [2] At the conclusion of the hearing, we reserved our judgment.  We did not have a concluded view on either the conviction appeal or the sentence appeal, but we were  WATCHORN vR CA385/2014[2014] NZCA416 [22August 2014]  clear that, even if the conviction were to stand, the sentence of imprisonment was not appropriate. The issues in the appeal are complex and we wish to take time to deal with them. In those circumstances we invited counsel for the appellant to make an application for bail pending the release of our decision. That application was made and we have now received a memorandum setting out the conditions of bail that had been agreed between counsel for the appellant and counsel for the Crown.  [3] We are satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to grant bail given the circumstances described above.   Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent 
IN Tlill HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY  CIV-2013-404-002070 [2014] NZHC 2001   BETWEEN  N Appellant   AND  N Respondent   Judgment:  22 August 2014    JUDGMENT OF COURTNEY J  This judgment was delivered by Justice Courtney on 22August2014 at 3.00 pm pursuant to R 11,5 ofthe High Court Rules  Registrar/ Deputy Registrar  Date........... ,........... ,.. ..  N vN [2014]NZHC200l [22August20l4]  [1J In a decision delivered a year ago I allowed Ms N's appeal and set aside an order made in the Family Coutt that required a payment of relationship prope1ty to a third party, which the Family Comt did not have jurisdiction to make. However, I also made a declaration regarding the status of that payment. As a result, there was no tangible benefit to Ms N from the appeal.  [2] Ms N has now sought costs of $15,760.70 on a 2B basis. She relies on the usual prh1ciple that a party who fails should pay costs to the party who succeeds. 1  [3] Mr N opposes any award of costs on the basis that the appeal did not advance Ms N's position and only had the effect of delaying the resolution of the substantive issues further. There has been no response by Ms N to this submission.  [4] I accept Mr Vickennan's submission made on behalf of Mr N, Whilst the appeal succeeded the end result was merely the resolution of the status of the payment in question, which could have been achieved in the context of the substantive hearing. In addition, I am mindful that the payment in question was made to the Inland Revenue Department in respect of a company tax debt in circumstances where the shares in the company were all or partly relationship property. I therefore decline the application for costs. Costs shall lie where they fall.   P Courtney J  High Comt Rules, r 14.2(e),  
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA448/2014 [2014] NZCA 415   BETWEEN MONTE PAUL TUHUA Appellant  AND THE QUEEN Respondent   Hearing: On the papers  Counsel: L Freyer for Appellant J E Mildenhall for Respondent  Judgment: 22 August 2014 at 9.00 am  JUDGMENT OF MILLER J  The application for bail is granted pending hearing of the appeal on condition the appellant is to reside at [ ]Auckland, and may not have direct or indirect contact with the victims.   REASONS  [1] The appellant seeks bail pending the hearing of his appeal against a short sentence (12 months) of imprisonment.  The Crown opposes on the ground that the prospects of success are not so high as to displace the statutory presumption against bail.  [2] The decisive consideration, however, is that the appeal may be rendered nugatory, or substantially so, if bail is not granted.  The appellant was sentenced on 24 July.   [3] In addition, the appeal is not without some merit.  [4] There are no safety concerns. The appellant complied with bail conditions pending trial.  [5] Bail is accordingly granted pending the hearing of the appeal.  The following conditions are imposed: the appellant must reside at [ ] Auckland, and he may not have direct or indirect contact with the victims.  Miller J  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY   CIV-2014-485-10800   [2014] NZHC 2006   IN THE MATTER  of the estate of MICHAEL de CHARMES   BEAUCHAMP   AND  PETER BRADFORD JOHNS   WENDY LENORE BEAUCHAMP   Applicants   On the papers:    Counsel: S J Scannell for Applicants Judgment: 22 August 2014  JUDGMENT OF WILLIAMS J  [1] The applicants seek an order under s 14 of the Wills Act 2007 (the Act) declaring a document as a valid will.  [2] The applicants are executors under the document. The second named executor is the deceased's former wife. The first named executor is the deceased's friend. The deceased had a valid will dated 3 June 1994 in which Wendy Beauchamp was to be the sole executor. In that will he left his entire estate to her absolutely unless she should predecease him. If she did he left the residuary estate to any infant children on trust until they should reach the age of 25 and then vesting  absolutely.  [3] The document the subject of this application is a draft will prepared sometime in 2014 by the same Hastings solicitors who prepared the valid will. have identified above the executors under that document. The document provides for bequests -$20,000 to a friend, Karen Shailer, and a mini motor vehicle to the co­executor Peter Johns. The remainder is to be vested in a trust to be distributed on 30 June 2016-with one-third to each of his three daughters: Lorna Caroline Stanley,  ESTATE OF MICHAEL DE CHARMES BEAUCHAMP [2014] NZHC 2006 [22 August 2014]  Joanne Cherie Beauchamp, and Ellen Beth Beauchamp. The allocation to Ellen Beth Beauchamp is to be held on further trust until she reaches 30 years. The trustees of that second trust are however empowered to release funds to the beneficiary before that date in order for her to purchase a home or for other special purposes, provided her mother (the co-executor) Wendy Beauchamp consents.  [4] All parties I have mentioned here consent to the validation of this document as the deceased's will. The document is not a valid will in terms of s 11 of the Act, because it has not been executed or attested. It clearly purports to be a will and was intended to be such. The deceased simply did not get around to signing it. I have no doubt that it represents the deceased's testamentary intentions and so the requirements of s 14 are satisfied.  [5] In light of the consent of all affected parties, it is in order for me to validate the document as the will of the deceased.  I   Jt/~-I ---------------,  Wi~sJ  
IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  [2014] NZCA 406  BETWEEN MILES ROGER WISLANG Intended Appellant  AND THENORTH SHORE FAMILY COURT Intended Respondent  Judgment: 20 August 2014 at 12.00 pm  JUDGMENT OFWHITE J (Review of Deputy Registrar’s Decision)  The application for review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision declining to accept a notice of appeal filedby the intended appellant is dismissed.   REASONS  [1] This is an application for review of a decision of a Deputy Registrar of this Court to refuse to accept for filing a purported notice of appeal.  [2] The application is made under r 7(2) of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005. I intend to address the substance of the application, but do not express a view on the scope of r 7(2) or its applicability to decisions of this nature.  [3] Mr Wislang has sought to file in this Court an appeal against “the decision of Cooper J, given in the High Court at Auckland on 16th July 2014, to refuse to timeously hear an urgent interlocutory application, dated 4th July 2014, for interim orders in proceedings of judicial review, reference CIV-2014-404-1670”.  [4] The Deputy Registrar of this Court did not accept the purported notice of appeal because he considered that the decision to which it related was not an appealable decision.  [5] The background to the decision to which the purported notice of appeal relates is that Mr Wislang has filed an application for judicial review in the High Court at Auckland in relation to an interim restraining order made by the North Shore Family Court.  [6] By minute dated 16 July 2014 Cooper J in the High Court at Auckland directed that the circumstances were not such as to warrant the matter being called prior to the respondents, the North Shore Family Court and the Minister of Social Development, taking any steps in response.1 Cooper J vacated the mention of the case scheduled for Thursday 16 July 2014.  [7] Mr Wislang has advised that the judicial review proceeding is now to be called in the High Court at Auckland on 21August 2014.  [8] Cooper J’s minute of 16 July 2014 does not contain a judgment, decree or order to which s66 ofthe JudicatureAct 1908 relates. Thedecision recorded in the minute does not prevent the judicial review proceeding from being heard. It dealt with a preliminary matter of case management which could not be the subject of an appeal to this Court.  [9] Thedecision ofthe DeputyRegistrar ofthis Courtnot toaccept MrWislang’s purported notice of appeal for filing was therefore correct.  [10] The application for reviewof the Registrar’s decision is dismissed.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 57/2014 [2014] NZSC 113   BETWEEN  NEW ZEALAND FIRE SERVICE COMMISSION Applicant   AND  INSURANCE BROKERS ASSOCIATION OF NEW ZEALAND INCORPORATED First Respondent   AND  VERO INSURANCE LIMITED Second Respondent    Court: McGrath, William Young and Glazebrook JJ  Counsel: F M R Cooke QC and ALHolloway for theApplicant R GSimpson and D J Friar for the First and Second Respondents  Judgment: 18 August 2014  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is granted (New Zealand Fire Service Commission v Insurance Brokers Association of New Zealand Inc [2014] NZCA 179)..    B The approved question is whether the Court of Appeal was correct to affirm the declarations made by the High Court.  [1] The above question is intended to cover the Commission’s arguments as to whether the High Court should have made declarations, given the alleged deficiencies in the factual foundation before the Court, as well as the issue of the correct interpretation of s 48 of the Fire Service Act 1975.  NEWZEALAND FIRE SERVICE COMMISSIONvINSURANCE BROKERSASSOCIATION OF NEW ZEALAND INCORPORATED [2014] NZSC 113[18August 2014]  [2] The respondents have asked that this appeal be heard this year before MrSimpson retires. They consider that morethan onehearingdaywillbe needed. The Registrar should therefore endeavour (if possible) to set the appeal down for a dayand a half before the end of the year.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV 2013-485-9326 [2014] NZHC 1905  BETWEEN CMS TRUSTEES LIMITED Appellant  AND C E V R Respondent  Hearing: 18 June 2014  Counsel: M L Greenhough for Appellant D G Dewar and C F Rieger for Respondent  Judgment: 13 August 2014  COSTS JUDGMENT OF RONALD YOUNG J  [1] In these proceedings the appellants appealed against the assessment of the Family Court of a costs category assessment of 3C and a 30 per cent uplift of the costs.  I dismissed the appeal.  The respondent now seeks costs on this appeal.  [2] The parties agreed at a case management hearing that the appropriate category was 2B. The respondent seeks increased costs because the respondent had herself incurred increased costs because she had appointed new counsel who was then unable to complete the hearing (he was appointed a Judge) and current counsel had to appear and get fully up to date on a complex and detailed history that the case involved.  CMS TRUSTEES LTD v C E V R [2014] NZHC 1905 [13 August 2014]  [3] Secondly, solicitor/client costs are in the region of $15,000, considerably more than costs on a 2B basis.  [4] In my view neither ground is a basis for increased costs. While I appreciate the difficulties current counsel had in coming up to speed with this case at the last moment that is not a basis for increased costs against CMS Trustees Limited.  [5] Secondly, 2B cost appears to work out at $10,029.60. I do not know what the actual costs are – it is said to “exceed $15,000”, but it is not known by how much. Costs of $10,000 would be two thirds of the $15,000 mentioned in the respondent’s submissions which is the desired reimbursement level.  [6] I therefore refuse the application for increased costs. I set costs on a 2B basis as per the respondent’s memorandum at $10,029.60, including disbursements.  [7] CMS Trustees Limited is now in liquidation. Counsel for the respondent included an application in its costs memorandum for a costs order to be made against the directors of CMS Trustees Limited. Without accepting responsibility the directors of CMS Trustees Limited have agreed to pay the 2B costs awarded. In  those circumstances I do not need to consider the respondent’s application.

         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  ROTORUA REGISTRY    CIV-2012-463-000275  [2014] NZHC 1872       IN THE MATTER OF     the Estate of UNITY ANN ETERNA (also known as UNITY ANN ELLMERS) of Turangi, Retired, Radiographer, Deceased      IN THE MATTER OF     Rule 27.6 et seq of the High Court Rules      BETWEEN     IAN DONALD FARQUHAR  Plaintiff      AND     MALCOLM ROSS ELLMERS  Defendant       Hearing:     On the papers      Counsel:     J N Briscoe for Plaintiff  G R Webb for Defendant      Judgment:     8 August 2014         JUDGMENT OF WILLIAMS J (Consent Orders and Decision as to Costs)     [1] This matter has been referred to me by Associate Judge Christiansen.  It is unnecessary for me to refer to the lengthy background.  The parties are agreed that the application for probate in solemn form in relation to the deceased’s will dated 16 April 2008 be declined and that probate be granted instead in relation to the will of 1 July 2002.  I make those orders accordingly by consent.   [2] The only remaining issue is as to costs.  The defendant asks that his costs be met by the plaintiff/executor personally and that the plaintiff/executor be required to carry his own costs as well.    [3] The arguments are essentially that costs should follow the event and the defendant was successful, and secondly that this is one of the rare cases where the    executor should not be entitled to have his costs met by the estate.  This, says the defendant, is because of the unreasonable and obdurate stance the executor took in relation to these proceedings.     [4] According to the Laws of New Zealand, Administration of Estates, an executor who approves a will normally in solemn form will be entitled to costs from the estate.1  But executors may be refused costs or required to pay costs to a successful party if it is proved that he or she must have known that the will could not be supported.  Unreasonable and obdurate conduct by the executor may disentitle access to estate funds and render the executor liable for costs for him or herself.   [5] The question in this case is whether the executor here crossed that line.  I do not think he did.  On the contrary the executor appeared to adopt a position more closely akin to that of the defendant once a medical opinion was to hand, tending to suggest that the deceased lacked testamentary capacity.  Although the executor could have been more careful and thoughtful in seeking to propound the deceased’s 2008 will, in light of her known psychiatric difficulties, I accept that his stance could not be described as unreasonable.     [6] The defendant will be entitled to costs of a category 2B basis.  The costs of the plaintiff may be met by the estate.    1  Laws of New Zealand Administration of Estates at [122]-[127].             ___________________________      Williams J    Solicitors:  Davys Burton, Rotorua for Plaintiff   Nolans, Gisborne for Defendant

REASONS  [1] Mr Rabson applies for the recall of our judgment of 14 July 2014.1 In that judgment, the Court declined an application for review of a decision byGlazebrook J adjourning Mr Rabson’s application for leave to appeal (on the basis that the most sensible and expeditious course was to apply for recall of the Court of Appeal’s judgment).  [2] Mr Rabson submits the decision should be recalled on threebasis:  (a) that Glazebrook J should not have participated in the review decision;  Rabson v Chapman [2014] NZSC 90.  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON vWAYNE SEYMOUR CHAPMAN [2014] NZSC 103 [6August 2014]  (b)  if that is not accepted, that the review decision should have been made by five judges; and   (c)  that the decision was in contravention of Mr Rabson’s “statutory right of appeal”.    [3] The first two points were dealt with explicitly in our review decision. As explained at n 3 of that decision, the Court assumed that s 28(3) of the Supreme Court Act 2003 applies to leave applications. Ifthat is the case, the Court comprises the judges set down to hear that application. Section 28(3) requires the participation of the judge whose decision is the subject of the review.  [4] Mr Rabson’s third ground is a repeat of his argument on his review application. We point out that there is no statutory right of appeal. There is only a right to apply for leave to appeal. Mr Rabson’s application for leave to appeal is adjourned only and so remains live until granted or dismissed.  [5] The application for recall is therefore dismissed.  The way forward  [6] It appears from his submissions that Mr Rabson does not wish to apply for recall of the Court of Appeal’s decision. If Mr Rabson does intend to make an application for recall, then he should inform the Registrar of this Court on or before 5pm, 14 August 2014. If no communication to the Registrar is made by that date, this Court will make a decision on his leave application.  Solicitors: Buddle Findlay,Wellington for the Respondent  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC134/2013 [2014] NZSC 104   BETWEEN  RAZDAN RAFIQ Applicant   AND  THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFTHE MINISTRY OF BUSINESS, INNOVATIONAND EMPLOYMENT Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, William Young and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person W N Fotherby for Respondent   Judgment:  6 August 2014    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall of judgment is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant applies for recall of a judgment of the Court dated 19 February 2014. In that judgment the Supreme Court declined leave to appeal against a decision of the Court ofAppeal in which Harrison J on 27 November 2013 dismissed applications by Mr Rafiq to review decisions made by the Registrar of the Court of Appeal.1 Thosedecisions were arefusal to waive securityforcostsand to allocate a fixture for Mr Rafiq’s intended appeal against an order for security for costs made against him in the High Court2 in proceedings brought by Mr Rafiq against the Chief Executive of the Ministryof Business Innovation and Employment for defamation.   1  Razdan Rafiq v The Chief Executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment  [2013] NZCA586.  2 Rafiq v Chief Executive of the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment [2013] NZHC 1134(PriestleyJ).  RAZDAN RAFIQ vTHE CHIEF EXECUTIVEOF THE MINISTRYOF BUSINESS,INNOVATIONAND EMPLOYMENT[2014] NZSC104[6August 2014]  [2] In the decision of 19 February 2014,3 the panel of the Court dealing with the leave application (Elias CJ, William Young and Arnold JJ) considered there was no issue of public or general importance in respect of the proposed appeal against the security for costs ordered in the Court of Appeal and no appearance of miscarriage of justice.  [3] In the present application for recall of the judgment, Mr Rafiq raises no grounds which would justify recall of the judgment. He asserts, without further reasons, that the decision of the Court was in error and says that the “allegations that are subject matter of this proceeding are presently being shared with other departments and agencies and this action needs to end”. No substantiation for the assertion that the Court ofAppeal erred is provided by way of elaboration.  [4] No basis for recall is made out.  The application is accordingly dismissed.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 59/2014 [2014] NZSC 100   BETWEEN  VINCENT ROSS SIEMER Applicant   AND  REGISTRAR OFTHE SUPREME COURT First Respondent   MINISTRY OF JUSTICE Second Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, William Young and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person H M Carrad for Respondents   Judgment:  5 August 2014    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a judgment of Clifford J delivered in the High Court striking out judicial review proceedings he had commenced in respect of a decision by the Registrar of this Court declining to make available to him copies of all applications for leave to appeal and associated submissions so that he can post them on a website and make them generally available.1 This refusal was in both general terms, in response to an email of 2 October 2013 from Mr Siemer, and also particular to a specific application for leave to appeal, Harrison v Auckland District Health Board.2 Based on his analysis of the judgment of this Court in  1 Siemer v Registrar, Supreme Court [2014] NZHC 1179. 2 Harrison v Auckland District Health Board [2013] NZSC98.  VINCENTROSS SIEMER vREGISTRAR OF THE SUPREME COURT[2014] NZSC100[5August 2014]  Mafart v Television New Zealand Limited3 the Judge concluded that any challenge to the Registrar’s decision (or decisions) would have to be made direct to judges of this Court.  [2] The application falls to be determined under s 14 of the Supreme Court Act 2003. If this Court is ultimately required to determine the procedural issue – as to whether judicial review is available in the High Court in respect of the Registrar’s decisions – it will be much assisted by the views of the Court of Appeal. The applicant could avoid this procedural question by having the underlying substantive issue – as to access to applications for leave to appeal and submissions – determined on direct application for review of the Registrar’s decisions. For these reasons the s 14 test has not been satisfied.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondents  Mafart v Television New Zealand Limited [2006]NZSC33, [2006] NZLR 18.  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 60/2014 [2014] NZSC 102   BETWEEN  DOUGLAS AND CHRISTINE SANDRA BANKS Applicants   AND  GREY DISTRICT COUNCIL Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, Glazebrook and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicants in person J Shackleton and D AWard for Respondent   Judgment:  5 August 2014    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicants, the Banks, are involved in a dispute with the respondent, the Grey District Council, concerning a residential property in Blaketown, Greymouth that they occupy under a ground lease from the Council. The dispute concerns the timing of rent reviews under the ground lease. The Banks were unsuccessful before Fogarty J in the High Court1 and have filed appeals in the Court of Appeal against the Judge’s substantivedecision and his subsequent decision on costs.2  [2] TheBanks are self-represented. The Court of Appeal has not yetheard their appeals.  On 13 May 2014, Stevens Jgave directions that:  (a) both appeals would be heard together;  1 Grey District Council v Banks [2013] NZHC 1485. 2 Grey District Council v Banks [2013] NZHC 2304.  DOUGLASAND CHRISTINE SANDRABANKS v GREYDISTRICTCOUNCIL[2014] NZSC 102[5August 2014]  (b)  the appeals would be heard on the basis of the case on appeal filed by the Council;   (c)  all questions of costs would be dealt with as part of the appeals; and   (d)  there should be a one day fixture.    [3] The Banks seek leave to appeal to this Court against these directions, in particular the directions in (b) and (d). There is a question as to whether they filed their application in time, but as any delay was minimal, we will address the application on its merits.  [4] Procedural orders of the sort made by Stevens J are made under s 61A(1) of the JudicatureAct 1908. Under s 61A(2)such directions maybe varied orset aside byapanel ofCourt ofAppeal judges. That is themechanismbywhich challenges to this type of procedural order should be brought pre-hearing.   [5] If the directions of the single judge are upheld on review, the unsuccessful party may seek leave to appeal to this Court, although the Court is most unlikely to grant leave in respect of an interlocutory application of that type. The appropriate course is for the unsuccessful party to wait until the substantive appeal has been determined and, if unsuccessful, to seek leave to appeal to this Court against that substantive decision, raising the alleged procedural error(s) as a ground of appeal, along with any other grounds.   [6] This is not to say, of course, that this Court would necessarily grant leave in such circumstances. The application for leave to appeal would have to meet the grounds set out in s 13 of the Supreme Court Act 2003.  [7] In the result, we are not satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice that we hear and determine this appeal. Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

PUBLICATION IN LAW REPORT OR LAW DIGEST PERMITTED.  IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CRI-2014-044-001376 [2014] NZHC 1845  UNDER the BailAct 2000  BETWEEN  YUN QING (JACK) LIU   Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN   Respondent   Hearing:  5 August 2014   Counsel:  M Kan for theApplicant   W P Cathcart for the Respondent   Judgment:  5 August 2014    (ORAL) JUDGMENT OF DUFFY J  Solicitors: MichaelKan Law, Auckland Meredith Connell, Auckland  [1] The defendant, Mr Liu, has made a fresh application for bail today. Two earlier applications were declined by this Court.  [2] This is the first time that Mr Liu has advanced an application based on electronically monitored bail.  [3] The earlier decisions of this Court (see Liu v R [2014] NZHC 1422 and Liu vR HC Auckland CRI-2014-044-1376, 9 May 2014) reveal a concern that MrLiu poses a flight risk.  Electronically monitored bail may obviate that risk.  [4] As matters stand, I would not have been prepared to grant Mr Liu bail, for the same reasons as the other Judges had refused bail. But I do consider that the prospect of electronically monitored bail should be fully explored. If that can remove the flight risk, then it seems to me that in terms of the other factors in the BailAct 2000 and the presumption of innocence, Mr Liu should be granted bail.  [5] I understand from Mr Liu’s counsel that he will now be making an application for electronically monitored bail. Rather than dismiss the present application, I will adjourn it to a date to be fixed by the Registry, once the report on the suitability of Mr Liu for electronically monitored bail has become available.  [6] I understand from his counsel that Mr Liu’s employer is likely to re-employ him, should bail conditions permit him to attend work while on EM bail.  [7] Consequently, I direct that the EM bail assessors are to explore the suitability of Mr Liu’s proposed residence for a term of EM bail, and Mr Liu’s suitability for being employed whilst on EM bail. It is for Mr Liu to provide the assessors with the necessary information regarding his residence and prospective employer.  Duffy J 
         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY    CRI 2014-485-54  [2014] NZHC 1829       NEIL MARTIN CLARKE  Appellant        v        NEW ZEALAND POLICE  Respondent       Hearing:     5 August 2014      Counsel:     Appellant in Person  E M Light for Respondent      Judgment:     5 August 2014         JUDGMENT OF RONALD YOUNG J     [1] Mr Clarke is charged with using a phone to make a bomb threat and two charges of assault on police constables.  When he appeared in Court on 30 April 2014 the District Court Judge remanded him on bail requiring him to live at his residence and as a condition of bail not to contact the emergency services unless he had a genuine emergency.   [2] Mr Clarke filed a notice of appeal.  Essentially, the notice of appeal says that the condition of bail relating to the emergency services is difficult to obey because of its uncertain reach.   [3] I agree the condition of bail imposed is uncertain as to its meaning.  Presumably the emergency services are the Fire Service, the Ambulance and the Police.  The bail condition would prevent Mr Clarke from calling these services other than in emergencies.  Obviously citizens will have occasions when they need to    call the emergency services but there is no emergency.  The Judge could not have intended to prevent Mr Clarke from contacting the emergency services where he had a genuine enquiry but which was not an emergency.   [4] The bail condition is, therefore, quashed.  No alternative phrasing was suggested by the police which was functional.  Given a malicious phone call can be an offence (Telecommunications Act 2001, s 112(2)(a)) no substitute bail condition is required.      ____________________________  Ronald Young J  Solicitors:   Luke Cunningham & Clere, Crown Solicitors, Wellington  
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA720/2013 [2014] NZCA 362  BETWEEN  GORDON MARCUS MITCHELL Appellant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Hearing:  28 July 2014    Court: Harrison, Goddard andAndrews JJ Counsel: S K Green for Appellant  F Pilditch for Respondent Judgment: 31July 2014 at 2.30 pm   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The appeal against sentence is dismissed.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given byAndrews J)  [1] On 23 October 2013, Mr Mitchell filed a notice of appeal against the sentence of six months community detention and 150 hours community work imposed in theAuckland District Court on 27 September 2013,1 following his having pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing cannabis for sale. The conditions of the sentence of community detention included that he was to reside at a specified address and not leave the address without prior written approval of a probation officer, and was subject to a curfew at that address between the hours of 6 pm and 6 am.  R v Mitchell DCAuckland CRI-2012-004-11026,27 September 2013.  MITCHELLV R CA720/2013[2014] NZCA362[31 July2014]  [2] The essence of Mr Mitchell’s appeal (which he prepared without the benefit of legal advice) was that a bracelet which he is required to wear for the purpose of electronic monitoring causes discomfort and has aggravated swelling and pressure sores he suffered following a motor vehicle accident in 2001. He submitted that this prevents him from attending a rehabilitation centre he would otherwise attend three to four times a week.  [3] Although Mr Mitchell filed detailed submissions in support of his appeal, he was represented by Ms Green at the appeal hearing.  Ms Green conceded that there is a fundamental jurisdictional bar to Mr Mitchell’s appeal. This arises from s 69E(1)(e) of the Sentencing Act 2002 which provides:  69E Conditions of community detention during sentence term  (1) An offender sentenced to community detention is subject to the following conditions during the sentence term: …  (e) the offender must, when required to do so by a probation officer, submit to the electronic monitoring of compliance with the conditions of his or her sentence, which may require the offender to be connected to electronic monitoring equipment throughout the sentence term and not just throughout the curfew period;  [4] Thus, it is not the District Court that imposes the condition as to electronic monitoring; the probation officer may require an offender to submit to electronic monitoring.  [5] This Court has no jurisdiction to revisit the probation officer’s requirement that Mr Mitchell submit to electronic monitoring. It has no appellate jurisdiction in respect of the probation officer’s decision.  [6] Accordingly, Mr Mitchell’s appeal against sentence is dismissed.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  AUCKLAND REGISTRY   CIV-2013-404-000531   [2014] NZHC 1796   BETWEEN  KIRIWAI CONSULTANTS LIMITED   Plaintiff   AND  KENNETHANGUS HOLMES   First Defendant   KENNETHANGUS HOLMES and   DAVID BRIAN RUSSELLAS   TRUSTEES OF K A HOLMES 2003   FAMILYTRUST   Second Defendant   HOLMES VENTURES LIMITED   Third Defendant   Hearing: 31 July 2014 Appearances: P J Dale for Plaintiff B D Gray QC for Defendants Judgment: 31 July 2014    JUDGMENT OF COURTNEY J  This judgment was delivered byJusticeCourtney on31 July2014 at 4.45pm pursuant to R 11.5 oftheHigh Court Rules  Registrar / DeputyRegistrar  Date………………………..  KIRIWAI CONSULTANTS LTD v HOLMES &OR [2014] NZHC1796 [31 July2014]  [1] Mr Holmes has appealed my judgment of 19 March 2014 under which he was ordered to pay the plaintiff, Kiriwai Consultants Ltd, $2,681,274 together with interest. He applied for an order staying execution of the judgment pending determination of the appeal. After hearing counsel this morning I dismissed the application, with costs to the plaintiff on a 2B basis and reasons to follow.  [2] Mr Holmes deposed that he is unable to meet the judgment sum personally. However, he also asserted that his appeal is genuine and if a stay was not granted he could be bankrupted, rendering his appeal rights nugatory. Mr Holmes had proposed either an undertaking or a guarantee by Holmes Ventures Ltd (HVL) to meet the judgment in the event of the appeal failing. He said that HVL has net assets worth more than $10 million. However, HVL willnot give Kiriwai access to its accounts forcommercial reasons.  [3] Kiriwai will not accept either an undertaking or guarantee from HVL. It is not satisfied that HVL is sufficiently secure and does not wish to rely on HVL to meet the judgment. There was evidence at trial that the second defendants, Mr Holmes and Mr Russell, as trustees of Mr Holmes’ family trust, received the substantial purchase price for the HVL shareholding that gave rise to this litigation. Kiriwai considers that the trustees should be offering security. Mr Holmes has not given any explanation as to why they have done so.  [4] HVL’s unwillingness to allow Kiriwai access to its accounts is understandable. So, too, too, is Kiriwai’s unwillingness to accept Mr Holmes’ assurances regarding HVL. There is a long and unsatisfactory history between these parties. However, in the usual course Kiriwai would be entitled to enforce its judgment and I saw no reason why the usual course should not be followed.  [5] Following my decision to refuse the application Mr Dale undertook that no steps would be taken to enforce the judgment for 14 days, during which time Mr Gray would see if satisfactory security could be provided by the trustees. The matter was left on that basis, with leave reserved to come back to me ifnecessary.  P CourtneyJ

REASONS  [1] Mr Reekie seeks a recall of the judgment delivered on 29 May 2014 dismissing an appeal and an application for leave to appeal in respect of decisions  NICHOLAS PAUL ALFRED REEKIE v ATTORNEY-GENERAL [2014] NZSC 98 [30 July 2014]  made by single judges of the Court of Appeal as to security for costs. 1 The application is based on a mix of particular and general challenges to the judgment.  [2] We see none of the arguments advanced as warranting recall of the judgment.   [3] The allegations of torture were not ignored as the conduct said to amount to torture was referred to, as were the associated findings of fact made in the High Court. The Court noted the apparent inconsistency between the practice which obtained before the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005 and the approach taken in Siemer v Heron.2 There was no inconsistency between the conclusion that the wrongful detention claim was arguable and the conclusion that Mr Reekie had suffered no detriment because if all issues had been appropriately addressed, he would have remained in custody for the relevant period.  [4] The more general challenges (to the difficulties identified by the Court as to the role of the Registrar, the general principles set out in the judgment and the engagement by the Court with the merits of the appeals to the Court of Appeal) raise nothing new.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 45/2014 [2014] NZSC 97   BETWEEN  BRUCE JAMES KING Applicant   AND  ASB BANK LIMITED Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, Glazebrook and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person P V Shackleton for Respondent   Judgment:  28 July 2014    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for a stay of the determination of the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.    The applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent.  REASONS  [1] The applicant, Mr King, borrowed money from the respondent, ASB Bank Ltd, against the security of a property he owned.  The loans fell into arrears and ASB sought to realise its security. Having allowed Mr King time to attempt to sell the property himself, ASB sold the property by mortgagee sale.   [2] Mr King then issued proceedings against ASB seeking to have the loan agreements reopened or to obtain other relief, on the basis that ASB breached the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 and the Fair Trading Act 1986. As the proceeds of the sale were insufficient to meet Mr King’s full indebtedness, ASB issued a counterclaim seeking to recover the balance. ASB sought summary  BRUCE JAMES KING v ASB BANK LIMITED [2014] NZSC 97 [28 July 2014]  judgment both on its counterclaim and as a defendant in respect of Mr King’s claims  against it. Katz J granted both applications.1  [3] Mr King then filed an appeal in the Court of Appeal. He applied for a waiver of the requirement to pay security for costs. When the Registrar dismissed his application, Mr King sought a review of her decision by a single Judge of the Court of Appeal. Ellen France J dismissed his application and ordered him to pay security in the amount of $5,880 by 28 April 2014.2 Mr King now seeks leave to appeal against that decision.  [4] In addition, Mr King has filed an application for a stay of the determination of his leave application. He did so because a friend has agreed to lend him sufficient funds to cover the security fixed by the Court of Appeal and he wishes to see whether the Court of Appeal will permit him to revive his appeal by paying security for costs after the date fixed by Ellen France J.  [5] Whatever the outcome of Mr King’s further application to the Court of Appeal, we see no reason to delay dealing with his application for leave to appeal to this Court against Ellen France J’s decision. Accordingly, we dismiss his application for a stay of our determination.  [6] We are not satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice that we hear and determine this appeal. As the principles concerning security for costs were recently addressed by this Court in Reekie v Attorney-General,3 the proposed appeal does not raise any issue of general or public importance. Moreover, there is nothing in the material before us to indicate that there is any risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.  [7] Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed. The applicant must pay the respondent costs of $2,500.

[2] That position is reached essentially because it is recognised that there is benefit in the appellant attending the course of education proposed and, secondly and very importantly, because there is clearly a need for the appellant to be able to attend on his counsel and prepare for trial.  [3] I am therefore satisfied that I should allow appeal and vary the current bail terms as follows, namely:  (a)  The curfew is to apply Mondays to Fridays between the hours of 7 pm  and 7 am;   (b)  On Saturdays and Sundays a 24-hour curfew will apply, save for the hours of 8 am to 12 pm on Saturdays and Sundays.

NOTE: PUBLICATION OF NAME OR IDENTIFYING PARTICULARS OF COMPLAINANT PROHIBITED BY S 139 OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 1985.  IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 55/2014 [2014] NZSC 95   BETWEEN  G (SC55/2014) Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, Glazebrook and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person J E Mildenhall for Respondent   Judgment:  22 July 2014    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant, G, was convicted following a jury trial of the sexual violation of his 4 year old step-daughter and was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of five years.1 He appealed his conviction on the grounds first, that the verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence and second, that the Judge had made errors in his summing up to the jury. The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal.2 He now seeks leave to appeal to this Court.  [2] The decision of the Court of Appeal dismissing G’s appeal is dated 12 June 2013. G’s application is dated 30 May 2014 and is, accordingly, well out of time.   1 Rv G DCWellington CRI-2011-035-1816,27 September 2012. 2 G(CA663/2012) v R [2013]NZCA222.  G(SC55/2014) v R [2014] NZSC95 [22 July2014]  However, because G is self-represented, we will consider the application on its merits.  [3] While it is not entirely clear from the material filed, G’s principal ground appears to be that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable as there was insufficient evidence to support it. He also expresses concern about the way both his trial counsel and his counsel on his appeal conducted his case.  [4] TheCourt ofAppeal accepted thattherewere some issues withaspects ofthe complainant’s evidence, but considered nevertheless that she was consistent in relation to the essential allegation against G. The Court concluded that there was a rational and legitimate basis for the jury’s guilty verdict. As this Court has stated previously, it is not the role of a final appellate court to embark on a review of the strength of evidence at trial in a case where, as here, the Court of Appeal has delivered a fully reasoned judgment addressing the concerns that are the basis of the application to this Court.3  [5] Moreover, the concerns raised about counsel do not suggest that G suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of not having a fair trial or because the guilty verdict may be unsafe.4 G’s concerns about trial counsel were not raised in his appeal to the Court of Appeal and his concerns about appellate counsel are no more than general.  [6] We are not satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice that we hear and determine this appeal. It does not raise any issue of general or public importance and nothing has been raised to indicate that a substantial miscarriage of justice may have occurred. Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  [20 SC 36/2014 14] NZSC 92   BETWEEN  PAULANTHONYApplicant  BLAIR   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent    Court: McGrath, William Young and Glazebrook JJ Counsel: R M Lithgow QC forApplicant CA Harold for Respondent Judgment: 21July 2014  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is refused.  REASONS  [1] The applicant was convicted by a jury in the District Court of selling cannabis to a police officer at the door of a house and of possession of cannabis for sale.  The Court ofAppeal dismissed his appeal against conviction.1  [2] His application for leave to appeal is based on the grounds of wrongful admission of voice identification evidence and failure by the trial Judge to address the juryon that evidence in breach of ss 46 and 126 of the EvidenceAct 2006.  [3] TheCrown case was primarilybased on visual recognition ofthe applicant as the person who answered the door when a police officer knocked, and who sold the officer a tinnie. The officer gave detailed evidence of the appearance of the seller  Blair v R [2014] NZCA101.  PAULANTHONYBLAIR v R [2014] NZSC 92[21 July2014]  and identified the applicant from a photo montage. The officer also gave evidence that the seller he spoke with had a distinctive baritone voice and was the same person who had earlier called out “hold on” before answering the door. The applicant admitted being on the premises at the time and that he was the person who called out when the police officer knocked. His defence was that there was another person in the house, of similar appearance to the applicant, who answered the door, spoke with the officer and made the sale.  [4] The voice identification evidence had been admitted without objection at trial. The Court of Appeal decided that, on the balance of probabilities, it was reliable and therefore admissible under s 46 of the Evidence Act. The voice was distinctive, there was no background distorting noise and there had been a very short period of time between the two voices that were heard.2 We see no arguable error of approach nor any flaw in this reasoning that is indicative of a miscarriage of justice.  We see it as relevant to our conclusion that this is a case where two voices were heard ‘side byside’in circumstances where the opinion of the officer was based on a comparison that, on the evidence, he was in a position to make. It is not a case of an identification based on the familiarity of the witness with the accused’s voice.  [5] In relation to whetherawarning should have been givento the jury,a detailed direction on the visual identification evidence was given by the Judge, concerning which therewasno complaint. TheCourt ofAppeal decided that the Crown casedid not depend “wholly or substantially on the voice identification” in terms of s 126 of the Evidence Act. It turned on the visual identification.3 We see this analysis as correct beyond argument, so that no direction was required under s 126.  [6] Overall, the applicant raises no matter of general or public importance. Nor is there any indication a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred.   [7] Leave to appeal against conviction is refused.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent  2 At [11] and [13]. 3 At [21] and [26].

He applied without notice for an order preventing removal of the children from Auckland, and was successful.    [2] The matter was then allocated a directions conference because the Judge directed that and also directed a hearing.  However, the current position is that Ms Small is not advancing a request to relocate the children.  She feels aggrieved that Mr Eccleston has obtained this order.  She would like to have a conversation with him, but I have an impression that he is not really available for that conversation.  [3] Ms Meates asked me to refer the matter to Family Disputes Resolution so that they can have that conversation.  I do not perceive there is a legal issue that would support my making such a reference, nor that it would be proper for me to do so.  That is because, although Mr Eccleston has obtained an order, Ms Small is not seeking to relocate the children out of Auckland at the present time, and, accordingly, there is no issue between the parties currently within the parameters of Mr Eccleston’s application.  [4] It strikes me that unless a party makes an application for orders generally regarding the day-to-day care of the children, or Ms Small makes an application to relocate or to set aside the order that has been obtained, the matter is effectively closed.  [5] Even if Ms Small applied to set aside the order I would not regard it as appropriate to refer it to FDR.  It would be a more appropriate course to simply set that down for hearing.  [6] Accordingly, I note that there is no current issue joined between the parties in this matter and the file should be closed.  J G Adams Family Court Judge  
IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  CA174/2014 [2014] NZCA 320  BETWEEN  RAZDAN RAFIQ Appellant   AND  GOOGLE NEW ZEALAND LIMITED Respondent    Counsel: Appellant in Person TWalker for Respondent  Judgment: 14 July 2014 at 10am (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OF HARRISON J  A The application to review the Registrar’s decision refusing to dispense with security for costs is dismissed.  B The appellant is to pay the sum of $5,880.00 by way of security for costs on or before 30 July 2014.  REASONS  [1] On 26 May 2014 the appellant, Razdan Rafiq, applied to review a decision made by the Registrar on 15 May 2014, declining his application to dispense with security for costs on this appeal. She directed that the security be set at $5,880.00 and be paid on or before 12 June2014.  [2] The grounds for the Registrar’s direction were that Mr Rafiq had failed to establish it was in the interests of justice that costs be waived. In particular she was not satisfied that there were any exceptional circumstances justifying dispensation.  RAFIQ V GOOGLE NEWZEALAND LIMITED CA174/2014[2014] NZCA320 [14 July2014]  Impecuniosity alone does not suffice.1 Furthermore, the appeal does not raise an issue of public importance or significance.  [3] TheRegistrar was also entitled to give weight to the conclusion ofAssociate Judge Doogue, whose judgment is the subject of Mr Rafiq’s appeal, that his application to pursue a claim against the Commissioner had little prospect of  2 success.  [4] Mr Rafiq has failed to establish that the Registrar erred. Additionally I am independently satisfied that the appeal has no merit or prospects of success. The application to review is dismissed.

[3] The Registrar was also entitled to give weight to the unequivocal conclusion of Courtney J, whose judgment is the subject of Mr Rafiq’s appeal, that his application to pursue a claim against the Commissioner lacked merit and it would be wrong to expose the Commissioner to the inevitable costs of defending a proceeding without any prospects of success. 1  [4] Mr Rafiq has failed to establish that the Registrar erred.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 52/2014 [2014] NZSC 90   BETWEEN  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON Applicant   AND  WAYNE SEYMOUR CHAPMAN Respondent    Court: William Young, Glazebrook and Arnold JJ Counsel: Applicant in person  SABarker for the Respondent Judgment: 14 July2014  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for review is declined.  REASONS  [1] On 13 May 2014 Mr Rabson applied for leave to appeal against a decision of the Court ofAppeal striking out his appeal against a decision of Kos J.1  [2] One of Mr Rabson’s arguments is that an order striking out the appeal could not be made because his appeal had already been deemed abandoned under r 43 of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005. He had not applied for a hearing date or filed the Case on Appeal within the time frame set out in r 43(1).2 In addition, the three month period, under r 43(3), for applying for an extension of time had passed. In Mr Rabson’s submission there was therefore no appeal to strike out.   1 Rabson v Chapman [2014] NZCA 158. Mr Rabson’s submissions in support of his application for leave were received on 11 June 2014. The respondent’s submissions were received on 30 June 2014.  2 He was unable to do so because he had not paid security for costs: r 37(2).  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON vWAYNE SEYMOUR CHAPMAN [2014] NZSC 90 [14July2014]  [3] On 8 July 2014 Glazebrook J issued a minute indicating that the Court of Appeal, in striking out his appeal, may have overlooked the fact that his appeal had already been deemed abandoned.  In the circumstances, the minute suggested that the better course would be for Mr Rabson to apply for a recall of the Court of Appeal’s judgment. In the meantime, Glazebrook J adjourned Mr Rabson’s application for leave to appeal to this Court.  [4] Mr Rabson applies for a review of Glazebrook J’s adjournment decision under s 28(3) of the Supreme Court Act.3  [5] The course suggested to Mr Rabson in Glazebrook J’s minute was the sensible course and likelyto be the most expeditious.  [6] The application for review is declined.  Solicitors: Buddle Findlay,Wellington for the Respondent  We are assuming that s 28(3) applies to an application for leave to appeal. The Court conducting the review is the Court which was set down to decide the leave application. As we note in Siemer v Stiassny [2014] NZSC 80 at [4] and [6], section 28(3) requires the participation of Glazebrook J inthe Court deciding the review.  
         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  AUCKLAND REGISTRY    CRI-2013-404-000279  [2014] NZHC 1621       CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE  DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS          v        TONY DOUGLAS ROBERTSON       Hearing:     On the papers      Counsel:     A Longdill for the Crown  PJB Winter for Defendant      Judgment:     11 July 2014         JUDGMENT OF ASHER J   (Access to Court file - NZ Herald)    This judgment was delivered by me on Friday, 11 July 2014 at 11 am  pursuant to r 11.5 of the High Court Rules.        Registrar/Deputy Registrar                    Solicitors:   Meredith Connell, Auckland.  PJB Winter, Auckland.    Copy to:  D Fisher, New Zealand Herald.      [1] I refer to my judgment of 2 July 2014.1  When I issued that judgment I understood that there were two requests from Television New Zealand in relation to the psychologist’s report.  The TVNZ request had sought only the report of a psychologist Ms Tolond.  I refused the TVNZ application.  I now appreciate that in fact there were two different requests, one from TVNZ News and one from the New Zealand Herald.  The Crown opposed both applications.     [2] I now deal specifically with the New Zealand Herald request.  The New Zealand Herald request seeks copies of all documents on the present court file without limitation.   [3] For the same reasons that I have set out in my earlier judgment, applying my discretion under r 6 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2012, I refuse access at this point in the proceeding.  In addition to Ms Tolond’s report, there is a good deal of confidential material on the file.  It is personal to Mr Robertson and if he is not convicted he would wish to keep it confidential.     [4] The reason put forward for accessing the court file is “… to access the information as soon as possible to prepare reports for publication at the conclusion of the new proceedings faced by Mr Robertson.”  This reason is not persuasive.  There is no need for any particular media organisation to have access in advance of and in anticipation of suppression being lifted.  The file is of moderate dimensions, and could be read and understood by an experienced journalist within a relatively short timeframe.  All journalists are likely to have an equal opportunity to apply to see the material if suppression is lifted.  They can review their position then.   [5] For the time being, a balancing of the r 6.10(2) factors leads to a conclusion in favour of privacy.   [6] Therefore, I decline the application of the New Zealand Herald dated 16 June 2014.    1  Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections v Robertson [2014] NZHC 1526.    ……………………………..

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CIV-2013-404-5198 [2014] NZHC 1594  BETWEEN BECKETT BOOKS LIMITED Applicant  AND MOVING OUT 2012 LIMITED Respondent  Hearing: 10 June 2014 (on papers)  Appearances: Mr W McKean for the Applicant Mr G Bogiatto for the Respondent  Judgment: 9 July 2014  JUDGMENT OF ASSOCIATE JUDGE J P DOOGUE [on Costs]  This judgment was delivered by me on  09.07.14 at 4 pm, pursuant to      Rule 11.5  of the High Court Rules.     Registrar/Deputy Registrar   Date……………  [1] I gave judgment for the respondent in this matter on 20 May 2014. I invited counsel to settle the matter of costs or alternatively to file memoranda by 13 June 2014. A memorandum has been received from counsel for the applicant, Mr Bogiatto. That memorandum incorporates the assumption that a costs order will be made in favour of the respondent and sets out the amounts that the applicant ought to pay which, inclusive of disbursements, totals $6,080.  [2] I deal first with the question of which party should pay costs.   [3] I consider that in the light of r 14.2(a) HCR costs should be paid by the applicant as the party who has failed to the respondent who is the party who has succeeded.  [4] The costs and disbursements which are set out in the memorandum which Mr Bogiatto has filed appear to be reasonable. I therefore make an order that costs on a 2B basis are to be paid by the applicant in the sum of $5,970 together with disbursements of $110.00.  J.P. Doogue Associate Judge   
         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  NELSON REGISTRY    CRI-2014-442-11  [2014] NZHC 1590       BETWEEN     DARREN ALBERT JOLLY  Appellant      AND     NEW ZEALAND POLICE  Respondent        Hearing:     8 July 2014  (Heard at Wellington)      Appearances:     A Heward for appellant  E Riddell for respondent      Judgment:     8 July 2014         ORAL JUDGMENT OF CLIFFORD J     [1] This is an appeal against sentence.  The Crown consents to the appeal being allowed.    [2] The effect is that the sentence of 19 months’ imprisonment imposed on Mr Jolly on one of the charges he faced, (CRN 183), by Judge Zohrab in the District Court at Nelson on 11 June 2014,1 is quashed and that a nominal concurrent sentence of five months’ imprisonment is substituted in its place.    [3] On the basis that the Crown consents to that outcome, this appeal is allowed and the orders follow the Crown memorandum.   [4] I note, for the record, that the Crown’s consent to this appeal reflects the Crown’s agreement with the appellant, and the Crown’s advice to this Court, that at the time of sentencing it was understood by all involved, including Judge Zohrab, that Mr Jolly would be released very shortly after his sentencing date, based on time    1  R v Jolly DC Nelson CRI-2013-042-001945, 11 June 2014.  served.  The effect of allowing this appeal is that Mr Jolly will be released on 10 July 2014.            “Clifford J”        Solicitors:   City Legal, Nelson for appellant.

         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY    CRI-2013-485-35  [2014] NZHC 1592       BETWEEN     JACK HIGGINS  Appellant      AND     NEW ZEALAND POLICE  Respondent       Hearing:     8 July 2014      Appearances:     B Crowley for appellant  A Whittaker for respondent       Judgment:     8 July 2014         ORAL JUDGMENT OF CLIFFORD J       [1] This is an appeal against the fine element of a sentence imposed in the District Court on 14 April 2014 on the appellant Jack Higgins on one count of wilful damage by tagging.     [2] Mr Higgins is a young, first offender.  There was evidence that his offending may have been contributed to when he failed to continue taking prescription medication for a diagnosed condition of ADHD.  No permanent damage was caused by the tagging, and no reparation was sought.   [3] In a very brief decision recording the outcome only, the Judge convicted Mr Higgins following his guilty plea and fined him $750 together with Court costs of $130 in the following terms:    [1] Mr Higgins, on the one charge to which you earlier entered a guilty plea, convicted and fined $750, Court costs of $130.  [4] Mr Higgins had originally appealed his conviction, but that appeal has been abandoned.  The question before me today is simply whether the fine of $750 is, as Mr Crowley has submitted, out of line with general sentencing practice in the District Court and hence manifestly excessive.  His submission was that such practice would typically involve fines for this type of offending of between $100 and $200.   [5] For the Crown Ms Whittaker was not able to throw any light on sentencing practice in the District Court.  Ms Whittaker acknowledged she had no basis on which to challenge that submission.   [6] On that basis, I consider I should accept Mr Crowley’s submission.  I certainly have no reason not to do so.  Nor, and this is no criticism of the Judge’s decision in what was a very straightforward matter, am I assisted as to any written reasons why the particular level of fine was imposed.  A sentence will be manifestly excessive where it is significantly out of line with accepted sentences for like offending.  On the basis of the materials before me, I am satisfied that that is the case with the $750 fine imposed on Mr Higgins.   [7] I therefore allow the appeal and substitute a fine of $150 in place of the Court ordered fine in the District Court of $750.  The order for Court costs will remain.          “Clifford J”          Solicitors:   B Cowley, Barrister, Wellington for the appellant.  Crown Solicitor, Wellington for the respondent.  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CIV-2013-404-004642 [2014] NZHC 1568  UNDER the Administration Act 1969, the Trustee Act 1956 and the Public Trust Act 2001  INTHE MATTER of the Estate of RonaldAlfred Billingham  BETWEEN JAN MAREE BILLINGHAM Plaintiff  AND RICHARD GEORGE WILSONand MARCUS ANDREW HUGH RUDKIN Defendants  Hearing: (On the papers)  Counsel: PA Fuscic for Plaintiff G C Jenkin for Stepdaughters  Judgment: 4 July 2014  COSTS JUDGMENT OF VENNING J  This judgment was delivered by me on 4 July 2014 at 5.00 pm, pursuant to Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules.  Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Date……………  Solicitors: McVeaghFleming,Auckland JacksonRussell,Auckland Bruce Dell Law,Auckland  Copyto: G CJenkin,Auckland  BILLINGHAM vWILSON&ANOR [2014] NZHC 1568 [4 July 2014]  [1] The substantive issues in these proceedings have now been resolved without the need for hearing. The plaintiff seeks costs to be apportioned between the estate and the stepdaughters. The stepdaughters oppose the imposition of costs against them and argue the entire costs should be paid out of the estate.  [2] Mr Jenkin argues that it was not until the plaintiff’s submissions were filed on 5 March 2014 that the plaintiff’s position became clear in relation to the October 2012 will.   [3] Having reviewed the file, the minute of Associate Judge Abbott and the oral judgment of Woodhouse J I am satisfied that it is appropriate that part of the costs be borne by the stepdaughters as opposed to the estate generally.   [4] At the hearing before Woodhouse J the stepdaughters opposed leave being granted to commence proceedings by originating application. That was effectively resolved againstthem bythe grant ofleavethe Judgemade. Counsel fortheplaintiff was ready to argue the matter substantively before Woodhouse J. It was adjourned by the Judge as a matter of fairness because the stepdaughters were not in a position to argue the matter that day. The costs associated with that hearing should be allowed as against the stepdaughters.  [5] Further, following that grant of leave the substantive relief sought by the plaintiff was effectively conceded with the appointment of the Public Trust as trustee.  [6] In the circumstances there will be costs to the plaintiff on a 2B basis calculated in accordance with the scheduled attached to Mr Fuscic’s memorandum, save for a reduction for the hearing time to a quarter day, namely $1,892 to be paid out ofthe estategenerally; $6,291.70 to bepaidout ofthe stepdaughters’sharefrom the estate.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2014-485-4205 [2014] NZHC 1499  IN THE ESTATE OF  STANLEY AUBREY NOLAN (DECEASED)   Hearing:  On the papers   Counsel:  M B Deacon    Judgment: 1 July 2014  JUDGMENT OF MACKENZIE J  I direct that the delivery time of this judgment is  2.30 pm on the 1st day of July 2014.  Solicitors: Sumpter Moore, Balclutha.  Re Nolan (deceased) [2014] NZHC 1499 [1 July 2014]  [1] This is a without notice application to correct the will of the deceased. The application is made as an interlocutory application in the probate proceedings.  When the application for probate was considered the errors which are now sought to be corrected were noted by the Registrar. He declined to grant probate at that stage and indicated that an application to correct the will should be filed.   [2] The first issue for me is to consider whether the application can properly be dealt with without notice, under r 7.46(2) of the High Court Rules. I am satisfied that there are no other persons who are affected by the application or the order sought who should be given an opportunity to be heard on the present application. I accordingly am satisfied, under r 7.46(3), that the interests of justice require the application to be determined without notice.   [3] The circumstances giving rise to the error in the drafting of the will appear from the affidavit of the solicitor who prepared the will, Mr Deacon. Mr Deacon’s firm prepared mirror wills for the deceased and his late wife. The will of the wife was prepared first and was used as a template for preparing the will of the husband.   That method of drafting meant that the word “him” had to be changed to “her” and the word “husband” had to be changed to “wife”. The necessary changes were overlooked, in two places.  [4] I am satisfied, in terms of s 31(1) of the Wills Act 2007, that the corrections sought are necessary to correct a clerical error in the will, to carry out the deceased’s testamentary intentions.   [5] There will be an order correcting the will of the deceased dated 6 November 2008, a copy of which is annexed to the affidavit of Mark Barry Deacon sworn on 13 May 2014 as follows:  (a)  changing the word “him” where it appears in cl 2 of the will to “her”;   (b)  changing the word “husband” where it appears in cl 3 to “wife”.    “A D MacKenzie J”

[2] Mr Churchman responds that the application is mischievous, because the defamation proceeding against Ms Strachan rests on one publication to one person on one occasion. Any award of damages must be confined to that single publication.  MOODIE v STRACHAN CA871/2013 [2014] NZCA 289 [30 June 2014]  [3] We are not persuaded that our judgment was inaccurate in any relevant way, so as to meet the established test for recall. We decline to recall it.  Solicitors: Izard Weston, Wellington for Respondent  
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA363/2013 [2014] NZCA 286  BETWEEN STUART GRAEME SPURR Appellant  AND FARMLANDS FUEL LIMITED (FORMERLY CRT FUEL LIMITED) Respondent  Court: Randerson, Stevens and French JJ  Counsel: Applicant in person M B Couling for Respondent  Judgment: 30 June 2014 at 3.00 pm (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall is dismissed.    REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Stevens J)  [1] The applicant, Mr Spurr, seeks recall of this Court’s judgment delivered on 23 May 2014,1 dismissing his application for recall of an earlier decision of this Court2 declining to extend time for him to appeal a decision of the High Court adjudicating him bankrupt.3 The present application is more accurately described as  1 Spurr v Farmland Fuels Ltd [2014] NZCA 196 [second recall decision]. 2 Spurr v CRT Fuel Ltd [2013] NZCA 567 [extension of time decision]. 3 CRT Fuel Ltd v Spurr HC Timaru CIV-2012-476-237, 30 April 2013.  a third application to recall the first decision by this Court, declining to grant an extension of time to Mr Spurr.4  [2] The grounds for seeking this latest recall essentially repeat those relied upon in the two prior unsuccessful applications. Mr Spurr also includes myriad additional grounds in his application relating to alleged fraud and injustice, all of which have been raised in various iterations in previous submissions. None of these provide a basis for this Court to reconsider its judgment declining to grant an extension of time. The application for recall is dismissed for the same reasons as given in earlier judgments.5  [3] In the second recall decision we noted that repetitive applications by Mr Spurr would be dealt with summarily.6 That approach has been followed with this application. We also direct the Registrar not to accept for filing any further applications for recall of our decision extending time by Mr Spurr.  Solicitors: Anderson Lloyd, Dunedin for Respondent  4 See second recall decision, above n 1, at [3] – that application for recall was also framed as an application to recall the first recall decision of this Court, Spurr v Farmlands Fuel Ltd [2014] NZCA 48 [first recall decision], but was treated as an application to recall the extension of time decision, in reliance on Colman v Attorney-General [2013] NZSC 59 at [1] and Peterson v Lucas [2014] NZSC 6 at [9].  5 First recall decision, above n 4, at [6]–[14] and second recall decision, above n 1, at [5]–[8].  6 Second recall decision, above n 1, at [3].  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  [2014] NZSC 80   BETWEEN  VINCENT ROSS SIEMER Appellant   AND  MICHAEL PETER STIASSNY &ANOR Respondent    Court: Elias CJ, McGrath, William Young, Glazebrook and Arnold JJ Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment: 25 June 2014  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] Mr Siemer applies for recall of this Court’s judgment in Siemer v Stiassny delivered on 13 June 2014.1  [2] That judgment dismissed an application for review, pursuant to s 28(3) of the Supreme Court Act 2003, of a decision of Glazebrook J which dismissed an application for review of a decision of the Supreme Court Registrar, under s 28(2) of the Supreme Court Act.  [3] Mr Siemer’s recall application is on the basis that Glazebrook and Arnold JJ should not have been on the Court for the s 28(3) review. This is because Glazebrook J conducted the review under s 28(2) and Arnold J had been involved  Siemer v Stiassny [2014] NZSC70.  VINCENTROSS SIEMER vMICHAELPETER STIASSNY&ANOR [2014] NZSC80[25 June 2014]  with the matter at an earlier stage. Mr Siemer also says that he should have been given the opportunity to make submissions on the composition of the Court.   [4] Thereason Glazebrook and Arnold JJ wereon the Court was explained in the judgment,2 byreference to this Court’s decision in Howard v Accident Compensation Corporation.3 That case involved an application for review of a decision by McGrath Junder s28(2)ofthe Supreme Court Act. McGrathJ was part ofthe Court deciding the s28(3) review.  In that case the Court said:4  Adecision under s 28(3) is to be made by the “Judges of the Supreme Court who together have jurisdiction to hear and determine a proceeding”. The subsection has obvious application to decisions made by a single Judge under s 28(1) or (2) being reviewed at the subsequent hearing of the substantive appeal. In such circumstances, the Judge who made the decision would probably be involved in the exercise (which is why McGrath J has participated in this decision). We are addressing the applicant’s application on the assumption, but without deciding, that s 28(3) is available in the present, and rather different, circumstances.  [5] Mr Siemer was apparently unaware of this Court’s decision in Howard v Accident Compensation Corporation and so did not make submissions on the composition of the Court in his s 28(3) application. He has, however, now had the opportunity to make submissions on this point in this recall application.  [6] The Court has considered Mr Siemer’s submissions but is not persuaded that its interpretation of s 28(3), as set out in Howard v Accident Compensation Corporation, is wrong. The participation of Glazebrook and Arnold JJ on the Court was required by s 28(3),5 despite their earlier involvement in the matter.  [7] The application for recall is accordingly dismissed.  2 At n3.  3 Howard v Accident Compensation Corporation [2014] NZSC 31 (Elias CJ, McGrath, William Young, GlazebrookandArnold JJ).  4 At [3].  5 On the assumption a s 28(3) review is available in these circumstances: see Siemer v Stiassny, above n  1,  at  n3.   
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 47/2014 [2014] NZSC 81   BETWEEN  RAJENDRA PRASAD Applicant   AND  INDIANA PUBLICATIONS (NZ) LIMITED Respondent   SC 48/2014    BETWEEN RAJENDRA PRASAD Applicant  AND INDIANA PUBLICATIONS (NZ) LIMITED Respondent  Court: McGrath, William Young and Arnold JJ Counsel: Applicant in Person Judgment: 25 June 2014  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] Mr Prasad has applied for recall of the Court’s judgment of 20 June 20141 dismissing applications for leave to appeal against decisions of the High Court and Court ofAppeal.   Prasad v Indiana Publications (NZ) Ltd [2014] NZSC78.  PRASAD v INDIANAPUBLICATIONS (NZ) LIMITED [2014] NZSC 81 [25 June 2014]  [2] The grounds for the present application are expressed very generally. The applicant asserts that the judgment is in serious breach of the law, has caused substantial miscarriage of justice and was wrongly made by “bundling” unrelated matters, with the result that it is misconceived and of no relevance to the applications for leave to appeal. The submissions make extensive reference to the underlying copyright and bankruptcy proceedings in which final judgments have been entered against the applicant.  [3] Nothing in what the applicant has put to us raises matters that could give the Court jurisdiction to reconsider the judgment it has delivered. The Court is also satisfied that the form of its judgment, which addressed applications in respect of three judgments of the Court of Appeal and High Court, was appropriate in the circumstances.  [4] The application for recall is accordingly dismissed.  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 53/2014 [2014] NZSC 79   BETWEEN  RONALD VAN WAKEREN Applicant   AND  THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFTHE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS Respondent    Court: McGrath, William Young and Glazebrook JJ Counsel: Applicant in Person Judgment: 24 June 2014  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall of judgment is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks recall of the Court’s judgment, delivered on 6 June 2014,1 dismissing his application for leave to appeal against a judgment of the Court ofAppeal rejecting his application for habeas corpus.  [2] The applicant’s first ground for seeking reconsideration is that the Court did not address in its judgment the validityof the warrant for imprisonment under which he is detained. This is incorrect. In paragraph [8], the Court found that the warrant had been properly issued, in respect of an amended sentence imposed by the Court of Appeal, thus upholding its validity.

The appeal should have been lodged by 28 April 2014. Ms Webby has applied for a waiver of the time within which her appeal ought to have been lodged.  [2] Ms Webby explained that she was not given the correct postal address for the Court.  [3] The Council does not oppose the waiver application.   Consideration and Decision  [4] Under s281(1)(a)(ii) RMA, I may waive the time within which anything must be lodged in the Environment Court, but only if I am satisfied that none of the parties to the proceedings will be unduly prejudiced (s281(2)).  [5] The only other party to the appeal is the Council, which does not oppose the application. The appeal was only filed about 3 working days late. I am satisfied that no party will be prejudiced, and I grant the waiver sought.   DATEl&gton thi  Jo,._day of June 2014  BP Dwyer Environment Judge  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 47/2014 [2014] NZSC 78   BETWEEN  RAJENDRAPRASAD Applicant   AND  INDIANA PUBLICATIONS (NZ) LIMITED Respondent   SC 48/2014    BETWEEN RAJENDRA PRASAD Applicant  AND INDIANA PUBLICATIONS (NZ) LIMITED Respondent  Court: McGrath, William Young and Arnold JJ Counsel: Applicant in Person Judgment: 20 June 2014  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The applications for leave to appeal are dismissed.  REASONS  [1] This judgment deals with applications by Mr Prasad to appeal against one decision of the High Court and two decisions of the Court ofAppeal.  [2] First, he seeks leave to appeal against a judgment of Venning J in the High Court which upheld a judgment of an Associate Judge striking out as an abuse of process a claim by Mr Prasad seeking to re-litigate issues already determined by the  RAJENDRAPRASAD vINDIANAPUBLICATIONS (NZ) LIMITED [2014] NZSC 78  courts.1 Venning J also directed the Registrar not to accept for filing any further purported proceedings from the applicant relating to the issues of breach of copyright or costs that had led to the applicant’s bankruptcy.  [3] Mr Prasad also applies for leave to appeal against two decisions of Wild J in the Court of Appeal directing the Registrar not to accept documents that the applicant had endeavoured to file. In both decisions, Wild J ordered that the Registrar not accept any further papers from the applicant without prior leave of a Judge.  [4] The background to these matters is the applicant’s desire to challenge a District Court judgment in copyright litigation which was adverse to him, the propriety of subsequent costs orders in that proceeding, and the appellate courts’ eventual refusal to entertain the applicant’s attempts to re-litigate final judgments on these matters. He also seeks to challenge earlier decisions of this Court refusing leave to appeal against the original judgments entered against him.2  [5] None of the applications raises a question of general or public importance or other ground making it necessary in the interests of justice to hear and determine the proposed appeal. In particular, although the outcome of the copyright and bankruptcy proceedings has been frustrating and burdensome for the applicant, there is no indication that a substantial miscarriage of justice will occur if the appeal is not heard.   [6] As well, in relation to the application against the judgment of Venning J, there are no exceptional circumstances that would justify a direct appeal to the Supreme Court.  [7] Accordingly each of theapplications for leave to appeal is dismissed.  1 Prasad v Attorney-General [2013] NZHC 2721. 2 Prasad v Indiana Publications (NZ) Ltd [2010] NZSC 60; and Prasad v Indiana Publications (NZ) Ltd [2012] NZSC 43.  
IN THE EMPLOYMENT COURT AUCKLAND [2014] NZEmpC 105 ARC 32/14  INTHE MATTER OF an application for leave to filechallenge out of time  BETWEEN BENJAMIN JOHN AUSTIN Applicant  AND YOOBEE LIMITED Respondent  Hearing: By written submissions filed on 12 Mayand 12 and 19 June 2014  Appearances: Applicant in person T Clarkeand E Coats, counsel for respondent  Judgment: 20 June 2014  JUDGMENT OF CHIEF JUDGE G L COLGAN  [1] Benjamin Austin has applied forleave to challengeout oftime apreliminary interlocutory determination of the Employment Relations Authority (the Authority) finding that proposed evidence in Mr Austin’s personal grievance will be inadmissible.1  [2] The Court has not needed to hear submissions from the respondent, Yoobee Limited, and is able to determine Mr Austin’s application for leave in the following circumstances.  [3] On 13 June 2014 the parties were advised by Minute that a judgment of the full Court, which was to issue that day, would likely be determinative of Mr Austin’s challenge, even if the Court were to grant leave for that to be made out of time. The  1 Austin v Yoobee Limited [2013] NZERAAuckland 504.  BENJAMIN JOHN AUSTIN vYOOBEE LIMITED NZEmpC AUCKLAND [2014] NZEmpC 105 [20 June 2014]  full Court judgment referred to is H v A Limited.2 The Registry supplied copies of this judgment to the parties. Having considered his position as he was invited to by the Court’s minute of 13 June 2014, Mr  Austin has nevertheless advised the Registry that he wishes to proceed with his application.  [4] Mr Austin’s application for leave to challenge outoftime is dismissed. That is because s 179(5) of the Employment Relations Act 2000 (the Act), as interpreted by the full Court in H v A Limited, precludes statutorily a litigant from challenging a determination of the Authority about its procedure. Determining that proposed evidence is inadmissible is amatterof the Authority’s procedure.  The scheme ofthe Act is for the Authority to get on and determine the proceeding on its merits. If Mr Austin is dissatisfied with the Authority’s substantive determination of his grievance, hewillhavea right ofchallengebyhearingdenovo. In thecourseofthis,hewillbe entitled to re-argue the question of the admissibility of the evidence which the Authority has refused to consider. Thus, the Authority’s determination on the inadmissibility of the evidence does not create an irrevocable injustice for Mr Austin.  [5] For the foregoing reasons, the application for leave to challenge out of time is refused. Yoobee Limited may be entitled to an order for costs on this application. It may, however, be significant, in determining such an application, that the law was, until a week ago, uncertain on the question of whether parties are entitled to challenge preliminaryAuthoritydeterminations on admissibility of evidence.  [6] Mr Austin’s personal grievance remains with the Authority for investigation and determination on its merits.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA42/2014 [2014] NZCA 256  BETWEEN  KARL DEE MCQUILLAN   Appellant   AND  THE QUEEN   Respondent   Counsel:  J Moroney forAppellant   J M Jelas for Respondent   Judgment:  18 June 2014 at 3 pm    (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF HARRISON J  The application for bail is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The appellant, Karl McQuillan, was sentenced in the Manukau District Court on 17 December 2013 to four years imprisonment following his conviction for one count of possessing 24.8 grams of methamphetamine for supply.1 He filed an appeal against his conviction on 24 January 2013. One of his primary grounds of appeal is that fresh evidence is now available which answers the Crown’s allegations against him.   R v McQuillian DCManukau CRI-2010-057-2348, 17December 2013 at [12].  MCQUILLAN v R CA42/2014[2014] NZCA256  [2] MrMcQuillan has applied for bail pending determination of his appeal,2 which I have personally considered.3 The test to be applied is well known.4 Bail is not to be granted unless I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it would be in the interests of justice in this case to do so. Mr McQuillan carries the onus of showing why bail should be granted and must show that his circumstances are exceptional.   [3] MrMoroneyadvances two grounds in support ofthe application. Thefirst is based upon what he says is the strength of Mr McQuillan’s appeal. As has been said frequentlybyJudges of this Court, it is neither necessarynor appropriate to carryout a detailed analysis of the merits of an appeal when determining a bail application. It is sufficient to observe that Mr McQuillan must show that his prospects of success are strong. He relies heavily upon the fresh evidence of two witnesses, MsWilliamson and Ms O’Brien. Having reviewed the brief affidavits filed byboth witnesses, I am not satisfied that they show, at this preliminary stage, that the merits of Mr McQuillan’s appeal are strong.  [4] Second, Mr Moroney emphasises that there is a suitable address and family support available should Mr McQuillan be granted bail. This factor does not of itself carryanyweight.   [5] Theapplicationfor bail is declined.  [6] It is always open to Mr Moroney to request the Registry to allocate the first available fixture to hear Mr McQuillan’s appeal.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  AUCKLAND REGISTRY   CIV-2013-404-004931   [2014] NZHC 1369   BETWEEN  JUNHE   Appellant   AND  CYNTHIA BAI   Respondent   Hearing:  On the papers   Judgment:  18 June 2014    JUDGMENT OF COURTNEY J  This judgment was delivered by Justice Courtney on 18June2014at3.00pm pursuant to R 11.5 ofthe High Court Rules  ~  Registrar / Deputy Registrar  . /.,!?--,6"-# Date........................... .  MAmon  Deputy Registrar  HE v BAI (2014] NZHC 1369 (18 June 2014]  [1] In my decision delivered on 1 April 2014 I dismissed Mr He's appeal brought under s 119 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA). Mr He has now sought  leave to appeal my decision.  [2] Mr He makes his application under Part 2 of the Comt of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005. However, the application is properly brought under s 120 RTA which provides that any paity to an appeal under s 119 may appeal the determination with the leave of the High Comt or (if that leave is refused) for special leave of the Court  ofAppeal.  [3] Section 120(2) provides that:  An application to the High Court for leave to appeal to the Comt of Appeal under this section shall be brought, in accordance with the rules of the Comt, within 15 working days after the determination of the High Court, or within such fmther time as the High Comt may allow; the High Comt may grant leave accordingly if, in its opinion, the appeal involves a question of law that, because of its general or public importance or for any other reasons, ought to be submitted to the Comt of Appeal for a decision.  [4] The grounds for Mr He's appeal from the Tenancy Tribunal's decision were difficult to identify but I was satisfied that they did not involve a question of law. Nor do any questions of law appear from his application for leave to appeal, much less a question of law that is of general or public importance. Nor is there any other  reason that this matter justifies a second appeal.  [SJ Mr He's application for leave to appeal is dismissed.   P Comtney J  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 30/2014 [2014] NZSC 69   BETWEEN  VINCENT SIEMER Applicant   AND  NEW ZEALAND COURT OF APPEAL First Respondent   ATTORNEY-GENERAL Second Respondent   Court:  William Young, Glazebrook and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person A M Powell for Second Respondent   Judgment:  11 June 2014    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] Theapplicant issued High Court proceedings againstthe Court ofAppeal and the Attorney-General challenging a decision made by Wild J in the Court of Appeal as to security for costs. These proceedings were struck out in the High Court and he then appealed to the Court of Appeal. Security for costs was fixed in the sum of $5,880. The applicant then applied (under s 61A(1) of the Judicature Act 1908) for an order, by a judge, waiving the requirement to provide security. The Registrar of the Court of Appeal rejected the application on the basis that the correct procedure was for such an application to be made to the Registrar. The applicant then applied under r 7(2) of the Court ofAppeal (Civil) Rules 2005 for a review of the Registrar’s decision.  The result was an email from the Registryto the applicant which recorded:  VINCENTSIEMERv NEWZEALANDCOURTOF APPEAL[2014] NZSC 69[11June2014]  Justice French directs:  “I uphold the Registrar’s decision. Application to review dismissed for the reasons articulated in Siemer v Official Assignee [2014] NZCA 3.” French J, 11/03/2014  [2] The applicant seeks leave to appeal against this decision. The basis of the proposed appeal is that it was not open to French J to dismiss his application for review in this comparatively informal way, by what he claims was a “Secret Judgment”.  [3] Under theCourt ofAppeal (Civil) Rules 2005, there is noprescribed method for the delivery of interlocutory orders which can be, and often are, noted in handwritingon the file. Theapplicant relies on the PublicRecords Act 2005 but this merely requires that full and accurate records are maintained. Moreover, where an application in a case raises an issue that is identical to the issue raised in a previous case, a judge is entitled to refer to the reasoning in the earlier case as the basis for his or her decision in the present case rather than setting out again the full reasoning.  We therefore see no point of law of public orgeneral importance.  As well there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Second Respondent  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND SC 3/2014 [2014] NZSC 66  BETWEEN  GRAHAM EDWARD MCCREADY   Applicant   AND  ABC AND ANOTHER   Respondents   Court:  McGrath, William Young and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person   J K Scragg for Respondents   Judgment:  9 June 2014    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant is to pay costs of $2,500 together with disbursements to be fixed, if necessary, by the Registrar.  REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a judgment of Stevens J dismissing his challenge to a decision by the Registrar of the Court of Appeal not to dispense with security for costs. 1 The security required of the applicant was $5,880. The appeal to the Court of Appeal is against an order of adjudication in bankruptcy made against the applicant based on non-payment of an order for costs made against him in earlier proceedings.2  [2] We have anonymised the respondents because of suppression orders made in the High Court in related proceedings. We also note that the applicant sought an order disqualifying counsel for the respondents because of his complaint about the  1 McCready v ABC [2013] NZCA 646. 2 McCready v ABC [2013] NZHC 2594.  GRAHAM EDWARD MCCREADY v ABC AND ANOTHER [2014] NZSC 66 [9 June 2014]  conduct of a partner in the same firm in relation to his conduct in those related proceedings. There is nothing in this application as it is clear that the conduct of the partner is not relevantly “in issue in the matter” presently before this Court for the purposes of r 13.5.3 of the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act (Lawyers: Conduct and Client Care) Rules 2008.  [3] The principles relating to the discretion to dispense with security for costs have been reformulated in the judgment of this Court in Reekie v Attorney-General.3 The proposed appeal thus does not raise any question of public or general importance. In his judgment, Stevens J accepted, at least by implication, that the applicant was impecunious. As it turns out, however, the applicant could have provided security as he received an ACC payment of $8,001 early this year. In those circumstances, we can see no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.  [4] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

B  Mr Rafiq is granted an extension of time to pay security for costs.  In the   event  that  the  Supreme  Court  refuses  him  leave  to  appeal against  the   judgment delivered on 10 April 2014, he is ordered to pay the amount of   $5,880.00 within 14 days of the date of the Supreme Court judgment.     REASONS  [1] On 10 April 2014 I delivered ajudgmentdismissingMrRafiq’s applicationto review the Registrar’s refusal to dispense with payment of security for costs and ordered him to pay the sum of $5,880 on or before 1 May 2014.   [2] On 26 May 2014, well past the extended date for payment, Mr Rafiq filed an applicationforextension of time to pay securityfor costs.1 His grounds are that he is applying for leave to appeal my earlier judgment and “needs to allow the appeal  Rule 43 of the Court ofAppeal (Civil) Rules2005.  RAFIQ V THE PRIVACYCOMMISSIONER CA116/2014[2014] NZCA232  process to unfold in the Supreme Court”consistentlywith justice. Further, therewill be no prejudice or irreparable harm to the PrivacyCommissioner.  [3] On 29 May 2014 the Commissioner filed a memorandum advising that, while he believes MrRafiq’s application for leave to the Supreme Court is without merit, hedoes not oppose MrRafiq’s application for an extension oftime providingthat any extension ends “very soon after the Supreme Court issues its decision” on the application for leave.  [4] In these circumstances I vary the judgment delivered on 10 April 2014. MrRafiqis granted an extensionoftime to pay securityfor costs. In the event that the Supreme Court refuses him leave to appeal against the 10 April 2014 judgment, he is ordered to pay the amount of $5,880.00 within 14 days of the date of the Supreme Court’s judgment.

B  The notice of abandonment issued by the Deputy Registrar on 11 November   2013 is set aside.    C  The time for the applicant to apply for a  fixture is extended to 20 June   2014.     REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given byHarrison J)  [1] On 5 August 2013 the applicant, Avonside Holdings Ltd, filed an appeal against a judgment delivered by MacKenzie J in the High Court on 11 July 2013.1 The three month period for applying for a hearing date and filing the case on appeal  Avonside Holdings Ltd v Southern Response Earthquake Services Ltd [2013] NZHC 1433.  AVONSIDE HOLDINGS LIMITED V SOUTHERN RESPONSE EARTHQUAKE SERVICES LIMITED CA520/2013[2014] NZCA225  expired on 5 November 2013 without Avonside taking either of those steps. On 11 November 2013 this Court gave notice of abandonment of the appeal.2  [2] On 20 November 2013 Avonside applied for an extension of time to file its case on appeal and apply for a fixture. By reason of an administrative oversight in the Registry, the application was not drawn to the Court’s attention until recently. The respondent, Southern Response Earthquake Services Ltd, does not consent to or oppose the application.   [3] Avonside in fact filed its case on appeal on 28 November 2013, and Southern takes no objection to its contents.   [4] In support of the application, Avonside relies on the facts that the length of the delay was only 15 days, there was no prejudice to Southern, the case on appeal has now been filed and it has always intended to pursue the appeal.   [5] In thesecircumstances, in particular that the period of delay was short and the case on appeal has now been filed, we grant Avonside’s application for an extension oftime. Thenoticeofabandonment issued bythe DeputyRegistrar on 11 November 2013 is set aside. The case on appeal is treated as having been filed in accordance with the rules. The time for Avonside to apply for a fixture is extended to 20 June 2014.

[2] In my judgment of 29 November 2013 I answered three questions posed by the Social Security Appeal Authority (the Authority). Those questions involved issues relating to the meaning of aspects of ss 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001 (the Act).   [3] The three questions posed by the Authority were:  (1) Did the Authority err in law when holding s 10 of the Act as directed towards determining residence requirements in s 8(b) and (c) of the Act?  GREENFIELD v THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE MINISTRY OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT [2014] NZHC 1199 [30 May 2014]  (2) Did the Authority err in law by holding that a missionary must show that her settled life is in New Zealand and absences from New  Zealand are temporary, in order to be considered “ordinarily resident”  in New Zealand?  (3) Did the Authority err in law in its application of the meaning of  “ordinarily resident in New Zealand” to Mrs Greenfield’s situation?  [4] I answered all three questions “Yes”.  [5] I am satisfied that the issues raised by the questions I answered meet the criteria for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal.  [6] The questions which the Court of Appeal is invited to consider are whether I erred in law when I answered any of the questions set out in paragraph [3] above.  [7] Costs are reserved.

Date?.~//q  C. McKenzie Deputy Registrar High Court  Auckland  BUTLER v THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL [2014] NZHC 1156 [29 May 2014]  [l] Mr Butler has applied for an order under s 70 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 transferring a criminal proceeding currently in the District Court to this Court. When the application was called on 14 May 2014, there was no appearance by or on behalf of Mr Butler. I therefore directed that Mr Butler was to file written submissions in support of his application no later than 11 June 2014.  [2] Mr Butler has now purported to file an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Given the fact that I have not made any substantive decision, there are no grounds for leave to be granted. Mr Butler will, of course, have a direct right of appeal to the Court of Appeal once any substantive decision on his application is given.  [3] For this reason, and to the extent that it relates to the directions made in my minute, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  [4] I note that the application also seeks to challenge directions given by Woolford Jon 5 May 2014. I will leave it to Woolford J to respond to that aspect of the application.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND ROTORUA REGISTRY  CRI-2014-470-9   [2014] NZHC 1124   BETWEEN  ROBERTANDREWYEATES   Appellant   AND  THE QUEEN   Respondent   Hearing:  26 May 2014    Appearances: No appearance by Appellant H J Sheridan for Respondent  Judgment: 26 May 2014  JUDGMENT OF COOPER J  Solicitors: Ronayne Hollister-Jones Lellman, Crown Solicitors,Tauranga Copyto: RAYeates PO Box 148, Katikati  YEATES v R [2014] NZHC 1124[26May2014]  [1] Mr Yeates has appealed against his conviction and sentence on a charge of dangerous driving under s 35(1)(d) of the Land Transport Act 1998.   [2] Having convicted him, Judge Macdonald sentenced him to 40 hours community work and six months’ disqualification from driving.   [3] It appears that the only point raised on the conviction appeal arose out of the fact that the Judge dealt with the matter in the absence of a witness whom MrYeates wished to call. The witness was unavailable when the matter was dealt with on 19 March, although on the previous day when the matter was mentioned MrYeates had indicated that he would be ready to proceed on 19 March.  [4] The Judge dealt with that eventuality on the basis that he heard the prosecution evidence and then adjourned the case for resumption on 31 March, a date when he understood MrYeates’ witness would be present.  [5] On 31 March, however, MrYeates advised the Judge that the witness could not attend due to an appointment with a doctor and referred to a letter dated 5 March confirming that was the case.  [6] The question that would have arisen on the appeal is whether in the circumstances there had been a breach of MrYeates’rights pursuant to s 25(f) of the New ZealandBill ofRights Act 1990 to callwitnesses in his defence. However, the case has been called today and MrYeates has not appeared nor has he provided submissions in support of his appeal or given anyexplanation for his absence today.   [7] In the circumstances Ms Sheridan has suggested that I should treat the appeal as abandoned, but I think the proper course to follow is to dismiss it for want of prosecution and it is dismissed accordingly.

REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks a recall of the judgment of this Court delivered on 30April 2014 dismissing two applications for leave to appeal against three judgments delivered by Wild J in the Court of Appeal.1 The complaint is that the Court issued a single judgment dismissing two applications dealing with unrelated  Siemer v Official Assignee [2014] NZSC 42.  VINCENTROSS SIEMER vOFFICIALASSIGNEE [2014] NZSC 60 [26May2014]  respondents and what are said to be unrelated judgments2 and in the absence of an order consolidating the applications. No authority was cited for the proposition that it was not open to the Court to act as it did and we are satisfied that there is nothing in the applicant’s complaint which would warrant the recall of the judgment.  [2] The application to recallthe judgment is accordingly dismissed.  Solicitors: LeeSalmonLong,Auckland for Respondents  They were unrelated save in respect of some commonality between the challenges advanced by the applicant. 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 22/2014 [2014] NZSC 61   BETWEEN  VINCENT ROSS SIEMER Applicant   AND  DEPUTY REGISTRAR OFTHE COURT OFAPPEAL Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ and William Young J   Counsel:  Applicant in person P J Gunn for Respondent   Judgment:  26 May 2014    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks recall or correction of a judgment of this Court delivered on 1 May 2014 dismissing his application for leave to appeal against a judgment of O’Regan P.1 The basis of the application is the contention that the judgment “failed to address the legal question on which leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was sought”.   [2] The judgment at [4] addressed, albeit in slightly different terms, the legal question identified by the applicant. That question was not determined but this is a necessary function of the leave application beingdismissed.  The recall application is therefore, in substance, simply a reiteration of the argument made in support of the application for leave to appeal.

B The respondent must pay the applicant costs for a standard application for leave on a bandA basis and usual disbursements.  REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given by Ellen France J)  [1] We have decided that leave should be granted on one question of law. The question is a variation on the question identified by Mr Mitchell for the applicant.

He is one of several accused named in the indictment.  He applies for a discharge under s 347 of the Crimes Act 1961 on the grounds that, on the evidence to be adduced by the Crown, no reasonable jury, properly directed, would convict him.    [2] The charge arises following an extensive Police operation relating to alleged methamphetamine manufacture and associated drug offending.  The other accused face particular charges relating to the manufacture, possession and supply of drugs, but there is no specific count alleging any offending by Mr Lavea.   [3] In his submissions in support of the application, Mr Morison indicated that he has approached the Police and Crown counsel on a number of occasions in order to establish precisely what role the applicant is said to have played in the alleged criminal group and, in particular, what evidence the Crown relies upon as proof.  At the time he filed his submissions on 12 May 2014, Mr Morison had received no relevant information.   [4] Ms Pollett for the Crown says that the application and what the Crown considers “relevant evidence” have been reviewed and the application for a discharge is no longer opposed.  I know no more than I have just explained about why Mr Lavea was named in the indictment in the first place, but it is plain that the Crown does not offer any evidence in support of the one charge he faces.   [5] Accordingly, I order that Mr Lavea be discharged forthwith under s 347 of the Crimes Act 1961.  Orders under that section are required to be made in open Court.  This matter is to be called in the callover on Wednesday, 4 June 2014 for that purpose.  Mr Lavea’s attendance is excused.     ……………………………… Toogood J  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV 2014-485-4288 [2014] NZHC 1077  IN THE MATTER OF the Charitable Trust Act 1957  IN THE MATTER OF a charitable trust established by deed dated 12 July 2010 constituting the Prisoners Aid and Rehabilitation Trust  BETWEEN SUSANNE MARY WOOD Plaintiff  AND PRISONERS AID AND REHABILITATION TRUST Defendant  Hearing: 20 May 2014  Counsel: D McLay for the Plaintiff No appearance for the Defendant  Judgment: 21 May 2014   JUDGMENT OF MALLON J  [1] The Prisoners Aid and Rehabilitation Trust (“the Trust Board”) was incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 and is registered as a Charitable Trust Board. At a meeting of the Trust Board on 20 January 2014 the board resolved to cease trading on 31 January 2014, to apply to the Court for the Official Assignee to be appointed liquidator, and to authorise the plaintiff, who is the chair of the Trust Board, to prepare and sign the necessary documents for this action.   [2] Pursuant to that authorisation the plaintiff applies for an order putting the Trust Board into liquidation and that the Official Assignee be appointed as liquidator. The reason for the application is the financial position of the Trust Board. In 2013 it became apparent to the board that it had a deficiency in income relative to expenditure.  After full consideration and taking professional advice it reached the  WOOD v PRISONERS AID AND REHABILITATION TRUST [2014] NZHC 1077 [21 May 2014]  view that that most appropriate course was to cease to operate.  The Trust Board discussed that position with the Department of Corrections, its primary stakeholder. As a result of that discussion the Trust Board did not cease to operate immediately, so as to ensure that services it provided to prisoners would continue in the short term and alternative arrangements could be considered by the Department.  The Trust Board and the Department agreed that the Trust Board’s services would continue until 31 January 2014.  The present position, as set out in a balance sheet dated 30 November 2013, is that there is a small surplus of assets over liabilities.  However this is not a final balance sheet and there may be further creditors who are yet to submit invoices.  [3] The application has been advertised.  No party has filed any defence or opposition or appeared in opposition to the application at the hearing. The evidence is that liquidation has been carefully considered as the appropriate course in light of the financial position. I am satisfied that it is just and equitable that the Trust Board be put into liquidation.1  [4] Accordingly the defendant Trust Board is put into liquidation as at 10.17 am on 20 May 2014 and the Official Assignee is appointed to act as liquidator. The Official Assignee should note that, although the registered office of the defendant is in Wellington, the records of the defendant are principally maintained in Christchurch.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  CA208/2014 [2014] NZCA 193  BETWEEN PETER WILLIAM MAWHINNEYAS TRUSTEE OFTHE FORESTTRUST Applicant  AND THE COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE First Respondent  REGISTRAR OFTHETAXATION REVIEWAUTHORITY Second Respondent  Counsel: Applicant in person PHCourtneyfor First Respondent  Judgment: 20 May 2014 at 3.00 pm (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OFFRENCH J (Review of Deputy Registrar’s decision)  A  The application for review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision declining   to waive payment of the filing fee is granted.   B  The filing fee of $1,100 is waived.     REASONS  [1] Mr Mawhinney wishes to file an appeal in his capacity as trustee of the Forest Trust. He sought a waiver of the filing fee on the grounds of undue hardship. The Deputy Registrar declined to grant a waiver because Mr Mawhinney failed to provide any information relating to the financial position of the trust. He only provided information relating to his own personal circumstances.  MAWHINNEYASTRUSTEE OF THE FORESTTRUSTvTHE COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE CA208/2014[2014] NZCA193[20May2014]  [2] Mr Mawhinney then sought a review of the DeputyRegistrar’s decision.  [3] When the file was referred to me, I issued a minute giving Mr Mawhinney an opportunity to file a statutory declaration setting out theTrust’s financial position.  [4] Hehas sincedoneso. Accordingto the statutorydeclaration, the Trust has no fixed assets and no cash. Its only asset is the disputed debt at issue in the litigation.  [5] The Trust’s financial position was plainly relevant and the Deputy Registrar was correct to decline waiver in the absence of any information about it. Had the information been made available at the outset, the decision would have been different.  [6] I am satisfied in light of the new information that waiver should be granted.  [7] The application for review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision is therefore granted and the filing fee of $1,100 is waived.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor First Respondent  
         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  NAPIER REGISTRY    CRI-2014-441-000004  [2014] NZHC 1012       BETWEEN     GEORGE VICTOR KEMP  Appellant      AND     NEW ZEALAND POLICE  Respondent       Hearing:     16 May 2014      Counsel:     P B Webby for Appellant  C R Walker for Respondent      Judgment:     16 May 2014         REASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF COLLINS J     Introduction  [1] This judgment briefly explains why I must allow Mr Kemp’s appeal from a decision of Judge Mackintosh, in which she dismissed Mr Kemp’s application for costs under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967.     [2] On 27 January 2014, Mr Kemp was found not guilty of a charge of refusing to give a blood specimen.1  He was found guilty of careless of a motor vehicle.2  At the conclusion of the hearing Mr Kemp applied for costs in relation to the charge of refusing to give a specimen of blood.   [3] Judge Mackintosh dismissed Mr Kemp’s costs application.  However, her Honour’s reasons for finding against Mr Kemp were not properly recorded and cannot be deciphered.      1  Land Transport Act 1998, s 60(1)(c).  2  Section 37(1).  [4] Mr Kemp’s appeal against the refusal to award him costs involves a challenge to the way Judge Mackintosh exercised her discretion and engages the principles articulated in May v May.3   [5] In the absence of an explanation of the reasons as to why Judge Mackintosh dismissed Mr Kemp’s application, I cannot determine if Judge Mackintosh made an appealable error.   [6] Accordingly, I believe I must allow Mr Kemp’s appeal and remit his application for costs back to Judge Mackintosh for her to reconsider.  I make this order pursuant to s 274(d) of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011.    3  May v May (1982) 1 NZFLR 165 (CA); B v R [2011] NZCA 331 at [9]; Lawrence v R [2011] NZCA 272 at [11].        ____________________   D B Collins J        Solicitors:   Crown Solicitor, Napier for Respondent
