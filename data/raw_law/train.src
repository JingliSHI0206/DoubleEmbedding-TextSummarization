[3] A reminder email was sent by the Registrarto Mr Siemer, but no memorandum has been received from him.     SIEMER v REGISTRAR OF THE SUPREME COURT[2021] NZHC 1951 [30 July 2021]     Discussion  [4] All matters relating to costs are discretionary.3 The discretion must be exercised on a principled basis. And the determination of costs, so far as possible,  4   [ 5] I see no reason to depart from the usual course  respect to a proceeding or an interlocutory application should pay costs to the party who succeeds. 5  [ 6]   was a quintessential abuse of process, as Mr Siemer had simply re-packaged and re-filed a claim in the Wellington Registry that had been struck out by the High Court in Auckland. 6 There was equally no public interest element to the proceeding.        Result    [7] Costs are awarded to the respondent on a 1 B basis together with disbursements, totalling $5,602.     Isac J  Solicitors:

Pursuant to Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules  ……………………………… Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors/Counsel:  ShieffAngland,Auckland LeeSalmonLong,Auckland  TAUA,v TAHI ENTERPRISES LIMITED [2019] NZHC 2861 [5 November 2019]  [1] My 29 August 2019 minute explained the parties reached an interim accommodation, pending the Court of Appeal’s March 2020 hearing of related proceedings between them. Theparties wouldsimilarlyhave accommodated vacation of the fixture before meforan interlocutoryinjunction, but failed toexplain the scope of adjournment sought, with the result the civil list judge maintained the fixture, with that consensual result.  [2] At both parties’ request, I reserved the issue of costs. I regret the delay in responding to the parties’ timely engagement on costs. Their memoranda only were put before me for decision this week.  [3] The defendants now seek 2B costs in the amount of $5,377.50, essentially on the basis their expenses in preparation forand attendance at the hearing were wasted. Expressed in that way(and not as a(presently,unjustified) claim forindemnitycosts)1 , the claim relies entirely on my discretion,2 as the defendants do not claim benefit of any principle for determination of costs,3 and “increased costs” spring from such principled determination.4 Thus the claim is just for the plaintiffs’contribution to the defendants’ expenses. Implicit in the defendants’ claim is any wastage is attributable to the plaintiffs’ failure, here to express to the civil list judge the “cogent” and ‘efficient’reasons for the proposed adjournment. But the request foradjournment was joint; both parties bear responsibility for any shortfall in its expression.  [4] Isee no reason to exercise mydiscretion in favour of adetermination of costs now. Theapplication remains fordetermination; onlyappearancetime maybewasted; and either party ultimately may be successful. Myminute recorded my determination may include costs’further reservation, which is mydecision.  [5] Costs are reserved.  —Jagose J  1 HCR14.6(4). 2 HCR14.1. 3 HCR14.2. 4 HCR14.6(1).

VINCENTROSS SIEMER [2021] NZSC 72 [25 June 2021]  REASONS  [1] Mr Siemer has filed an application for recall of this Court’s judgment in Re Siemer. 1 In that judgment, the Court declined to vary the pre-trial suppression orders made by the Court in S (SC 58/2019) v Vector Ltd. 2  [2] Theapplication for recall is in substance an attempt to reargue the application for the Court to vary its suppression orders. Nothing has therefore been advanced which would warrant recall of the judgment.3 Theapplication for recall is dismissed.  [3] We add that the exception to the order suppressing the judgment applies only to publication in alawreport or lawdigest.

We issued a further judgment on 10 March 2021.2  [2] Mr Dyer now seeks leave of this Court,3 to apply for further directions regarding the imposition of interest on his share of the current account from 1 June 2012 to date, and the value of Ms Gardiner’s assets forthe purposes of compensation under s 44C(2)(a) of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976.  [3] Mr Dyer has not provided any reasons whyleaveshould begranted. Hedoes not explain why the matters now raised werenot addressed in his 30 November 2020 application, which sought directions relating to his entitlement to the current account and his entitlement under s 44C(2)(a).   [4] It is not appropriateforMr Dyer to now seek thesedirections, given healready had the opportunity to make extensive submissions on the two issues he now wishes to address. Further, in circumstances where the costs of this litigation, having been heardby threedifferent courts, is already disproportionate to thevalueof theproperty in issue, we consider it is not in the interests of justice to grant leave to Mr Dyer to seek further directions.  We decline leave to Mr Dyer to seek further directions.  [5] The respondents seek costs for this application.

[2] In doing so, the order made for intensive monitoring was that the maximum period be limited to 12 months from the date on which the ESO was made.  [3] For the Chief Executive, Ms Currie has brought to the Court’s attention that Mr Clements’ sentence release date is not likely to be4 June2021. Upon that basis the Crown had intended to seek that themaximum term of the intensivemonitoring be 12 months from the sentence release date.  [4] Mr Nicholls has responsibly indicated that Mr Clements will not oppose an amendment to correct the previous order.  [5] Accordingly, I recall the order made on 27 May 2021 in relation to intensive monitoring. The order now made is that the maximum term of intensive monitoring will be 12 months from Mr Clements’ sentence release date.  [6] Mr Clements will be required to be brought before the nearest High Court Registry to have a copy of these orders (as amended) provided to him.

REASONS  [1] On 5 November 2020, the applicant appeared in the District Court on two charges of driving while his licencewas suspended. Thehearing of thesecharges was adjourned to 21 March 2021. On 18 December 2020, heattempted to filein the Court of Appeal an application againstthe adjournment decision. This was rejected by the Deputy Registrarforwant of jurisdiction and Miller J dismissed anapplication by the applicant to review that decision.1 The applicant now seeks leave to appeal to this Court against Miller J’s judgment.  [2] There is no right of appeal in District Court criminal proceedings in respect of adjournments.2 If there were a right of appeal it would be to the High Court and not  1 Terry v New Zealand Police [2021] NZCA7.  2 Section 215 ofthe Criminal Procedure Act 2011liststhe types ofpre-trial decision inrespect of whichthere arerightsofappeal inJudge-alone cases.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANANUI SC 5/2021 [2021] NZSC 43  BETWEEN DONGLIN DENG Applicant  AND LU ZHENG Respondent  Court: O’Regan, Ellen France and Williams JJ Counsel: J D Turner and L X Huang for Applicant D Zhang and E Tie for Respondent Judgment: 14 May 2021  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A Leave to appeal is granted (Zheng v Deng [2020] NZCA 614).  B The approved question is whether the Court of Appeal was correct to make a declaration that there was a partnership between Mr Zheng and Mr Deng in which they were equal partners and to make orders that were consequential on that finding.  REASONS  [1] The appeal raises potential issues about the interpretation of documents translated from Mandarin and the cultural setting in an arrangement between two Chinese parties whose business relationship appears to have been conducted in Mandarin.  The Court of Appeal noted that it was conscious that language is used in a broader linguistic and cultural setting, by reference to background assumptions about personal and business relationships and the ways in which dealings are normally structured, that were shared by the parties, but which the Court may not be aware of  DONGLIN DENG v LU ZHENG [2021] NZSC 43 [14 May 2021]  or understand.1 The Court referred to the need to be sensitive to the social and cultural context and to be cautious about drawing inferences based on preconceptions about business dealings.2  [2] It may be necessary for this Court to explore these factors in order to resolve the appeal.  Accordingly, we invite the New Zealand Law Society | Te Kahui Ture o Aotearoa (the Law Society) to consider intervening in this appeal, after consultation with NZ Asian Lawyers. We direct the Registrar to bring the appeal to the attention of the Law Society and NZ Asian Lawyers and provide them with a copy of this judgment.  [3] We note that Orient Construction Ltd and Orient Homes Ltd were parties to the appeal in the Court of Appeal.  Neither is named in the notice of application for leave or the submissions filed by the parties. Counsel should confer and advise the Court within seven days whether, in light of the question on which leave has been given, either or both of those companies ought to be parties to the appeal to this Court.

Ueputy Registrar  High Court  Auckland  Solicitors: Public Defence Service, Auckland Crown Solicitor, Auckland  POA v NEW ZEALAND POLICE [2021] NZHC 1002 [6 May 2021]  [1] On 14 April 2021, Jesse Cam Poa appeared in the District Court at Notih Shore on a charge of assault with intent to injure. Mr Poa applied to vary his bail by altering his residential address and by varying his curfew from 7.00 pm to 7.00 am to one between 9.00 pm and 7.00 am.  [2] The Police prosecutor indicated to the District Comi Judge that the amendments were agreed to. After a further brief discussion between the Judge and counsel, the Judge made an order varying the bail address but overlooked the agreed variation to the curfew hours. Mr Dalton did not realise that the Judge had omitted the variation to the curfew until later and was unsuccessful in having the matter recalled. This appeal is the result.  [3] Counsel for the Police agree that an error was made by the Court that should be corrected on appeal.  [4] I allow the appeal accordingly. Mr Poa's terms of bail, as recorded in the warrant issued on 14 April 2021, shall be varied by changing the curfew hours from between 7.00 pm and 7.00 am to between 9.00 pm and 7.00 am. The other terms of bail remain unaltered.  Toogood J

Solicitors: Meredith Connell,Auckland  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE v BATEMAN [2021]NZHC 980[5 May 2021]  [1] In my judgment of 2 March 2021, I granted restraining orders in relation to specified property, pursuant to ss 24 and 25 of the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery)Act 2009.1 The Commissioner seeks costs on that application. As foreshadowed in my judgment (at [17]), I consider that the Commissioner has been largely successful and should have his costs on a 2B basis, together with disbursements, against the respondent. The Commissioner notes, however, that while a costs award may be available against Mr Hunt, one is not sought. The Commissioner notes, and I agree, that Mr Hunt’s involvement in the proceedings was relevantly limited and related to only one item of property subject to the Commissioner’s application for restraining and effective orders. It is also noted that Mr Hunt’s opposition was inherent in MrHitchcock’s case.  [2] On the basisof the foregoing, I am satisfied that theCommissionershould have his costs in the sum of $17,925.

Mr Harris does not oppose the application.  [2] The purpose of an extended supervision order is to protect members of the community from those who, following receipt of a determinate sentence, pose a real and ongoing risk of committing serious sexual or violent offences.  [3] Mr Harris is an offender eligible for an extended supervision order.  I am satisfied, having considered the matters addressed in the health assessor’s report dated 6 August 2020, that Mr Harris is at high risk of committing a relevant sexual offence in the future.  I have satisfied myself that the factors set out in s 107IAA of the Parole Act 2002 (the Act) apply to Mr Harris.  [4] The application is granted.  I make an extended supervision order against Mr Harris. The order will commence on his statutory release date of 17 May 2021.  The term of the extended supervision order is 10 years.  By operation of statute, the conditions of the extended supervision order are the standard conditions set out in s 107JA of the Act.  [5] The applicant applies also pursuant to s 107IAB of the Act for an order requiring the New Zealand Parole Board to impose an intensive monitoring condition on Mr Harris.  The application is not opposed.  Given Mr Harris’s history of accosting children and offending sexually against them, I am satisfied that I should make the order.  [6] I make an order requiring the Parole Board to impose an intensive monitoring condition on Mr Harris requiring him to submit to being accompanied and monitored, for up to 24 hours a day, by an individual who has been approved, by a person authorised by the Chief Executive, to undertake person-to-person monitoring.  The maximum duration of this condition is 12 months.  Brewer J

[2] The plaintiff is seeking an adjournment on the grounds detailed in an affidavit of Mr Murray Macarthy, the director of the plaintiff, which I willdetail furtherbelow.  The application is supported by the defendant.  [3] In Decemberof last year Mr Macarthy received news that his son, who resides in Australia, had been diagnosed with a serious medical condition.  He travelled from New Zealand to Australia in January 2021 when the Australian Government was  SIAM CUISINE LIMITED vAMYEDER [2021]NZEmpC 24 [11March 2021]  allowing travel between New Zealand and Australia. At the time hebelieved his time away would be of short to medium duration.  [4] Mr Macarthy’s son’s condition has not improved, and Mr Macarthy has remained in Australia to this date. Heis now having difficulty obtaining aspace in a managed isolation (MIQ) facility to return to New Zealand. He does not expect to be able to return until June or possibly July 2021, as MIQ spaces are booked up until June.

REASONS  [1] The applicant applied for the recall of this Court’s judgment of 27 November 2020 (the original judgment), in which his application for review of the decision of the Deputy Registrar was dismissed and his application for directions was also dismissed.1  [2] The application for recall was dismissed in a judgment issued on 11 February 2021 (the recall judgment).2  1 Siemer v Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court of New Zealand [2020] NZSC135. 2 Siemer v Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court of New Zealand [2021] NZSC 3.

LIANSEN MAO v INDUSTRIALANDCOMMERCIALBANK OF CHINA(NEWZEALAND) LIMITED [2021] NZCA36[2March 2021]   REASONS  [1] This judgment responds to an application to review the Registrar’s refusal to waive securityfor costs.  The Registrar was correct.  My reasons will be brief.  [2] Thedecision under appeal was given byWhataJinthe form of aminute issued on 28 October2020. TheJudgestruck out aproceedingin which Mr Mao challenged a settlement with the respondent Bank. It was a fourth proceeding in litigation challenging the Bank’s decision to recover a shortfall on a mortgagee’s sale in New Zealand byobtainingajudgment andfreezingorders inChina. Theproceedings havebeen struck out as untenable orabusive, and Whata Jconsidered this proceeding was either a rerun of those proceedings or the claims ought to have been brought earlier.  [3] Mr Mao says that his appeal is a matter of public interest and further that the bank abused court powers byobtainingfreezingorders in China. Healso saysthat the bank has adequate security under the freezing orders.  [4] Iagreewith the Registrarthat ithas not been shown that the respondent should haveto defend this appealwithoutsecurity. Mr Mao does not claim to beimpecunious, and it is not apparent to me that his appeal raises anyquestion of public interest.  Nor do I accept that the bank already has security; it maintains that assets affected by the freezing order are of insufficient value to recover amounts owed to the bank and the frozen assets maynot necessarilybeavailable foracostsordermadeinNewZealand. Thereis forcein the bank’s submission thatitneeds the protection afforded bysecurity because Mr Mao’s conduct is vexatious.  [5] The application is dismissed. The Registrar extended time for payment of $7,060 until 5 February. I will extend time for payment of that sum until 16March 2021.  Solicitors: Buddle Findlay,Auckland for Respondents

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors: Russell McVeagh, Auckland Copy to: Respondent  WEBSTER v BREWER [2021] NZHC 298 [26 February 2021]  [1] On 22 December 2020, I found the respondent in contempt of court and fined her $5,000 to be paid in its entirety to the applicants.  The respondent took no steps, formal or informal, to oppose or take part in the proceeding notwithstanding service of all documents on her.  [2] The applicants have now applied for costs on a 2B basis.  I have reviewed the applicants’ memorandum and calculations as to the appropriate costs.  [3] As to the successful party, the applicants are entitled to costs on a 2B basis.  I therefore order the respondent to pay the sum of $14,926.13 to the applicants towards their costs for the preparation and filing of the contempt of court application and the substituted service application and for appearance by counsel on 9 December 2020 together with disbursements.

[2] Although Ihave recorded above that there was no appearance forthe first and second defendants, the defendants had instructed solicitors. While those solicitors have not taken formal steps, they filed a memorandum advising the Court that the defendants will not be filing documents to oppose the claim.  [3] Having reviewed the documents, I am satisfied that the guarantee sued on covers the sums claimed in the statement of claim.  [4] The material filed confirms the first and second defendants do not have adefence to the plaintiff’s claim. Theadvice from the defendants’ counsel that they will not be filing documents to oppose that claim is consistent with the view I have reached.  [5] I am satisfied the plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment in terms of theMemorandum of Quantum dated 24 February 2021 in the sum of $720,426.35. The plaintiff is also entitled to costs on an indemnity basis as provided for in the relevant documents in the sum of $18,460.65, as per the affidavit of costs and disbursements dated 24 February2021.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANANUI SC 101/2020 [2021] NZSC 3  BETWEEN VINCENT ROSS SIEMER Applicant  AND DEPUTY REGISTRAR OF THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND Respondent  Court: Glazebrook, O’Regan and Ellen France JJ Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment: 11 February 2021  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall of this Court’s judgment of 27 November 2020 (Siemer v Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court of New Zealand [2020] NZSC 135) is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant has applied for the recall of this Court’s judgment of  27 November 2020, in which his application for review of a decision of the  Deputy Registrar was dismissed and his application for directions was also dismissed.1  [2] The position in relation to recall of a judgment was summarised by this Court  in Craig v Williams as follows:2  The case law has … identified three categories of case in which a judgment may be recalled. These are an amendment after the hearing to relevant legislation or a new judicial decision of “high authority”, where counsel has failed to draw the Court’s attention to a relevant legislative provision or  1 Siemer v Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court of New Zealand [2020] NZSC 135. 2 Craig v Williams [2019] NZSC 60 at [10].  VINCENT ROSS SIEMER v DEPUTY REGISTRAR OF THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND [2021] NZSC 3 [11 February 2021]  decision and “where for some other very special reason justice requires that the judgment be recalled”.3  [3] Neither of the first two of the above grounds applies, so the present application appears to be based on the third.  [4] Nothing in the application or the affidavit filed with it discloses any reason that justice requires the judgment to be recalled, let alone a “very special reason”. While the applicant makes it clear that he disagrees with a number of aspects of the decision, there is nothing in the material the applicant has put before the Court that requires reconsideration of the decision.  The Court does not therefore intend to engage with the arguments the applicant has put forward.  [5] The application for recall is dismissed.

REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byBrown J)  [1] On 2 December2020 the applicant’s request forleaveto bring asecond appeal was declined in a decision determined on the papers.1 Neither respondent sought an  SKP Inc v Auckland Council [2020] NZCA610.  SKPINCORPORATED vAUCKLAND COUNCIL[2021] NZCA5 [5February 2021]  order for costs in the written submissions which they filed. However they belatedly do sonow,each seeking an award of costs of $3,346.2  [2] The applicant opposes the making of any award of costs because it submits it is reasonable to infer that the Court deliberately declined to order or to reserve costs (in which eventthe Courtis said tobefunctus officio). Inthealternative theapplicant contends only one set of costs should be payable. It further submits there should be no costs awarded in favour of the Council in view of findings made by the Maori Appellate Court in what are described as related proceedings.  [3] Where the Court refuses leave to appeal an applicant will normally be liable forcosts: r 53G(1) of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005. Theomission of the respondents toseek an order for costsintheirsubmissions does not precludetheirnow applying. Nordoes this Court lack jurisdiction to makean order forcostsinthat event.  [4] Wedo not consider that thereareany reasons why the applicant should not pay costs in accordance with the principle stated in r 53A(1)(a). However we are not satisfied that on the application forleaveto bring asecond appeal two setsof costsare justified, notwithstanding the second respondent’s submission that it was appropriate for it to take an active role. One set of costs will suffice.  [5] Theapplicant is to pay the respondents oneset of costsin the amountof $3,346.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors: Crown Law, Wellington Copy To: G B Paterson, Australia  PATERSON vATTORNEY-GENERAL[2021] NZHC 61 [3 February 2021]  [1] The plaintiff’s claims against the Attorney-General were dismissed in my judgment dated 9 December 2020.1 The defendant seeks costs and disbursements in the sum of $25,903 which have been calculated according to schedule 2B of the HighCourt Rules 2016.  [2] MrPaterson submits thatcostsshould notbe awarded againsthimdueto the misconduct of the defendant in admitting that thedaily list published on 5 April 2016 contained an error. He emphasises that the proceeding was brought pursuant to s 27 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, and was not brought for financial gain.  MrPaterson also challenges the quantum of costs claimed on the basis that they are likely to exceed the actual costs incurred.   [3] I am not persuaded that these are reasons either to not award costs or reduce costs. MrPaterson’s submissions are essentially the same as the arguments which were put forward in support of his claim and rejected by me in the substantive judgment. The submission regarding quantum has no merit. The costs have been calculated according to scale and are undoubtedly less than the actual costs incurred.  [4] Thedefendant is entitled to costs as the successful party in the litigation. The costshavebeen conservatively calculated andare reasonablein allthe circumstances.  [5] Accordingly, I award costs and disbursements in favour of the Attorney-General in the sum of $25,903.  Edwards J  Paterson v Attorney-General [2020] NZHC 3253.

REASONS  [1] The applicant is serving a sentence of preventive detention for attempted murder and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.1 This is pursuant to a warrant issued by Brewer J on 11August 2017. An application by him for habeas corpus was dismissed by Powell J on 10 December 2020.2 He now seeks leave to appeal from that judgment.  [2] The application for habeas corpus and the current application for leave to appeal are based on a Maori sovereignty argument. The application dismissed by Powell J was the applicant’s third such application; the first having been brought  1 R v Warren [2017] NZHC 1913 (Brewer J). 2 Re Warren [2020]NZHC 3264 [HCjudgment].

Theproposed appeal does not raise a question of general or public importance and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.6  [4] The application for leave to appeal is accordingly dismissed.  3 Warren v Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2017] NZHC 12; and Warren v The Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2017] NZHC 2832. In both cases, the applicant then unsuccessfully applied for leave to appeal to this Court: Warren v The Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2017] NZSC 20; and Te Tangata Whenua (Warren) v The Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2017] NZSC 189.  4 HCjudgment, above n 2,at [7].  5 At [8].  6 Senior Courts Act 2016, s 74(2).

B  There is an order for costs in favour of the respondent for a standard   appeal on a bandA basis, plus usual disbursements.    REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byCourtney J)  [1] On 8 December 2020 this Court dismissed the appeal brought by BASF New Zealand Ltd (BASF) against a decision of the High Court setting aside a statutory demand againstthe respondent, Brian Roberts (1998) Ltd (BRL).1 BRLdidnot raise the issue of costs on the papers, nor in oral submissions. No order was made as to  BASF New Zealand Ltd v Brian Roberts (1998) Ltd [2020] NZCA634.  BASF NEWZEALAND LIMITED vBRIANROBERTS (1998) LIMITED [2020] NZCA662[18 December 2020]  costs. BRLhas applied for orders recallingthe judgment and havingitcorrected so as to address the issueof costs. BASFopposes that courseon the grounds that, sincethe issuewas not raised, thereis no error that would justifyrecall. Weagree that thereis no basis on which to recall the judgment. However, given that costs are at the discretion of the Court and generallyfollow the result,and that the issuewas not raised at the time of the hearing, BRLis not precluded from makingan application for costs now.   [2] Both parties haveindicated theirpositions regarding costsin theeventthat we were prepared to address the issue. BRL seeks costs for a standard appeal with certification forsecond counsel. BASFopposes certification forsecond counsel. This was a straightforward appeal that does not warrant certifying for second counsel. There is accordingly an order for costs for a standard appeal on a bandAbasis, plus usual disbursements. We make no order for costs in respect of the application for recall.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANANUI SC 87/2020 [2020] NZSC 149  BETWEEN ROBERT FRANK TERRY Appellant AND NEW ZEALAND POLICE Respondent Court: Glazebrook, O’Regan and Williams JJ Counsel: Applicant in person R K Thomson and S E Trounson for Respondent Judgment: 18 December 2020  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.   REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a decision of Courtney J dismissing an application for review of a decision of the Deputy Registrar of the Court of Appeal declining to accept for filing a notice of application for leave to appeal to that Court.1  [2] Courtney J upheld the decision of the Deputy Registrar because Mr Terry had exhausted his appeal rights against his conviction for a traffic offence.  He had appealed unsuccessfully from the decision of the Justices of the Peace convicting him to the District Court.2 He was then refused leave to appeal against the District Court decision by the High Court.3  1 Terry v New Zealand Police [2020] NZCA 415.  2 Terry v New Zealand Police [2019] NZDC 4742 (Judge Barry). His appeal against conviction was dismissed but his appeal against sentence was allowed.  3 Terry v New Zealand Police [2019] NZHC 1131 (Grice J).  TERRY v NEW ZEALAND POLICE [2020] NZSC 149 [18 December 2020]  [3] Mr Terry then attempted to file an application for leave to appeal against the decision of Grice J to the Court of Appeal, which was not accepted by the Deputy Registrar for filing, because Mr Terry had exhausted his appeal rights under the Criminal Procedure Act 2011.  That decision of the Deputy Registrar was upheld by Clifford J on review.4 Mr Terry sought leave from this Court to appeal against the decision of Clifford J, but this was declined.5  [4] Before filing the application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal referred to above, Mr Terry also filed a second application for leave to appeal to the High Court.  This was processed by the High Court apparently because the registry staff did not realise that the application related to the same matter that had been dealt with by Grice J.  This second application for leave to appeal to the High Court required an extension of time, which was refused by the High Court.6 Mr Terry then attempted to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the decision of Simon France J, and again the Deputy Registrar refused to accept this for filing because the Court had no jurisdiction to deal with it. That decision was upheld by Courtney J on review in the decision against which Mr Terry now seeks leave to appeal.  [5] It is clear Mr Terry has well and truly exhausted his appeal rights and that this Court has no jurisdiction to determine the present application.  His appeal rights were exhausted after the decision of Grice J. All the steps he has taken since then have been beyond the jurisdiction of the relevant courts.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors: Vallant Hooker & Partners, Auckland Crown Law Office, Wellington  PRAJAPATI v THE IMMIGRATION AND PROTECTION TRIBUNAL [2020] NZHC 3420 [18 December 2020]  [1] By my judgment of 23 October 2020, I dismissed the applicant’s application for judicial review of the decisions of the first respondent.1  [2] I held that the second respondent is entitled to costs and directed the parties to file memoranda. Apart from two aspects of the calculation the parties are agreed that scale category 2B costs apply. The respondent has calculated its costs on a scale 2B basis including disbursements as $13,030.49. The applicants dispute the claim for costs step 13, namely 0.30 days for appearance at the second case management conference before Palmer J on 13 May 2020.  The applicants note that the conference duration was for 20 minutes and they submit that the cost allowance should accordingly be based on 0.05 days yielding a figure of $119.50 rather than the $717.00 claimed by the respondent.  [3] I shall make that adjustment.  The applicants also say that the respondent has claimed taxi fares to and from Auckland Airport and air travel costs for counsel to travel from Wellington to Auckland for the hearing.  The applicants say that the proceedings were filed in Auckland and as there is a Crown Law Office in Auckland, counsel from Auckland could have been briefed to appear rather than incurring the costs for Wellington based counsel to appear.  [4] In my view it is not unreasonable for Crown Law Office to engage counsel based in its Wellington office which is its principal office and for counsel familiar with the matter to appear at the hearing.  I accordingly disallow the applicant’s submission that there should be an adjustment on that account.    Decision  [5] I make an order for costs in favour of the second respondent in the sum of $11,711.00 together with disbursements of $721.99.

Pursuant to Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules.  ………………………… Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors:  DavenportsWest Lawyers,Auckland  NEWTON v NEWTON [2020] NZHC 3337 [16December 2020]  [1] Robert Newton and Angela Newton werein adefacto relationship from early 1991. Robert had two children, Brian Newton and Carol Newton. Angela also had two children, Tia Patten-Williams and Annaliese Patten-Williams. On 22 October 1992, Robert and Angela both signed wills, drafted by their solicitors on their instructions. They each left theirestateto the otherif they survived by 14 days. Ifthey did not, the estate was to be divided equally between the four children. Robert and Angela married on 9 January 1998.  Robert died on 30 March 2009.   [2] Section 18(1)ofthe Wills Act 2007 provides that awillis revokedif the will-maker marries. So, underthat provision, Robert’s 1992 willwould havebeen revoked by the 1998 marriage. But s 18(3) provides that s 18(1) does not apply if “the will does not expressly say that itis madein contemplation of aparticularmarriage . . . but the circumstances existing when it was made show clearly that it was made in contemplation of a particular marriage” and the marriage that occurs is the contemplated one.  If s 18(3) applies, the 1998 will would be valid.  [3] Angela submits s 18(3) applies. She provides an affidavit attesting to the fact that she and Robert did not realise their marriage revoked their wills. They both believed Robert’swillwould remain in effect during the courseof his relationship with her, including if they married, without having to be updated. They were married for over 16 years after the will was signed. Angela applies for an order that the will not berevoked by s 18(1)on thebasiss 18(3)applies. Sheapplies foran order that service of the proceedings be dispensed with because all the interested parties, particularly Brian and Carol,have consented in writing to the orders sought.  [4] The evidence, including the mirror provisions of the two wills leaving the estates to all four children if both die, show that Robert’s will was made in contemplation that his relationship with Angela would endure and would have the status of marriage. That marriage occurred. I am satisfied it is in the interests of justice that the will is not revoked. I dispense with the need for service and declare the marriage did not revoke the will.

He sought findings that he was a permanent employee who had been unjustifiably dismissed together with financial remedies. Recreational Services has denied these claims.  1 Edwards v Recreational Services Ltd [2020] NZERA301 (Member Loftus). 2 At [39].

[4] The costs determination was not challenged within time. 4 Mr Edwards has now applied for leave to extend the time to challenge the costs determination. The sole ground of the application was that a mistake had been made by his agent, Mr Moore, who wrongly believed that a successful challenge to the substantive determination would automatically result in the costs determination being set aside.  [5] Recreational Services has consented to the application. For that reason I am satisfied itcan be allowed and time extended accordingly.  [6] The application is granted.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors/Counsel: Crown Solicitor, Hamilton. McKenna King Ltd, Hamilton.  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE v McIVOR [2020] NZHC 3149 [30 November 2020]  [1] Police investigated Jaron McIvor for downloading and selling pirated movies.  The Commissioner of Police restrained funds in his bank accounts totalling almost $818,000 and crypto-currencies now worth more than $21 million.  Mr McIvor acknowledged profiting from downloading and selling movies protected by copyright.  [2] Some of Mr McIvor’s ill-gotten gains found their way to bank accounts of his brother, Andrew.  The Commissioner restrained almost $386,000 and crypto­currencies now worth $1.77 million in his accounts.  [3] The brothers recently agreed to forfeiture of all crypto-currencies and all but $400,000. I approved their agreement with the Commissioner on 16 November 2020.  [4] I was satisfied this outcome was consistent with the purposes of the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009, and the overall interests of justice. I reached this conclusion because the overwhelming majority of restrained funds were forfeited, and litigation over the balance (of $400,000) would be disproportionately expensive and time consuming.  In short, I considered settlement met the public interest.   …………………………….. Downs J

However, given mydirectionforthematterto returntothe Family Court for its determination, my preliminary view is costs should lie where they fell: thatis, be borne by the party incurring them.  [2] Mr Little claims 2B costs in the amount of $17,925, plus disbursements of $1,835. Pointing out Mr Little failed on his former two grounds of appeal, Mrs Little proposes costs lie where they fell; alternatively, she should be awarded two-thirds the claimed costs, and Mr Little onlyone-third. Practicallyspeaking, that is to claim anet payment of nearly $6,000 to Mrs Little.  [3] The latter outcome would be to disregard the first general principle applying to determination of costs, that “the party who fails with respect to a proceeding … should pay costs to the party who succeeds”.2 Irrespective of how they got there, only Mr Little was successful, and Mrs Little unsuccessful, on the appeal. Mrs Little was not prosecuting any separate cross-appeal on which she may be thought to have succeeded by setting aside the Judge’s order for reference back to the Judge.  [4] Critically, “so far as possible the determination of costs should be predictable andexpeditious”.3 In otherwords, itshould havebeenobviousto the parties what costs award was likelyto accompanyloss. Thereason for mypreliminaryviewonlyjustifies refusing costs if that is accepted bythe parties, despite predictability and expedition.4 Otherwise refusal is at least as inflammatory as may be the known costs exposure’s pursuit. But an award then is the principled result.  [5] I order Mrs Little pay Mr Little costs in the amount of $17,925, plus disbursements of $1,835.  —Jagose J  1  Little v Little [2020] NZHC 2612 at [33] (citation omitted).   2  High Court Rules 2016, r 14.2(1)(a) (emphasis added).   3  Rule 14.2(1)(g).   4  Rule 14.7(g).

REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given by Brown J)  [1] On 29 April 2020 MrSiemer filed an appeal againstaminute of Palmer J dated 28 February 2020 in which the Judge chose not to proceed further with consideration of the possibility of making an order under s 166 of the Senior Courts Act 2016 in respect of Mr Siemer.  [2] In a judgment delivered on 4 September 2020 we made an order striking out the appeal because the minute to which the appeal was directed did not determine any  Re: Siemer [2020] NZCA571[18November 2020]  issue against Mr Siemer.1 Hence there was no judgment decree or order2 susceptible to appeal by him.  [3] Mr Siemer has filed an application for recall of our judgment focusing on paragraph 21 which read:  [21] However the minute records that Palmer J elected not to pursue the s166route. The minute itselfdoes not contain any decision or determination.  Hence the observation in the minute of Cooper J that there is no live legal issue concerning any order made against Mr Siemer.  [4] Mr Siemer challenges the accuracy of that paragraph, contending that it is a clear case of misstatement of fact and that correction is necessary to avoid appearance of judicial recklessness or impropriety.   [5] There is no error in paragraph [21].  The essence of that paragraph and of the judgment as a whole is that in the minute of 28 February 2020 there was no determination by the High Court against Mr Siemer’s interests which gives rise to a right of appeal by him.  [6] In any event the alleged error in ourjudgment is not amattergiving rise to the exercise of the recall jurisdiction.3 If Mr Siemer wishes to challenge our judgment, then the appropriate course is for him to apply for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.   1 Re: Siemer [2020] NZCA393. 2 Senior CourtsAct 2016, s 56(1)(a). 3 Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2) [1968]NZLR 632 (SC).

[2] Mr Paora was remanded on bail on conditions includinghe not possess, useor access any cellphone or device capable of connecting to the internet or sending text messages, and acash suretyof $100,000 belodged and liable to beforfeited “in whole or in part”on his failure to comply with a condition of his bail.  [3] A police search of Mr Paora’s bail address on 11 October 2019 located two cellphones and other electronic devices, after which he was arrested and ultimately brought before me on 16 October 2019. My minute then recorded:  Iamsatisfied on thebalanceofprobabilitiesMrPaora hasbroken thespecified condition. MrPaora consents to remainingin custodyfortwo weeks while the police continue investigations.  Expressly “[o]n that basis”, I remanded Mr Paorain custody for a further two weeks.  [4] Perhaps given Mr Paora’s temporary consensual detention and the ongoing policeinvestigations, no question arosebeforeme if Mr Paora’sfailureto complywas “without reasonable excuse” in terms of s 39(3). My expressed satisfaction in terms of s 39(1) was only of Mr Paora’s failure to comply. But non-performance of the condition being ‘without reasonable excuse’is what additionally requires entryof the non-performed condition in the court record.  [5] For those reasons, there is no foundation for the money paid under the surety to beforfeited,asforfeiturerelies on additional entryin thecourtrecordunder s39(3).

B The approved question is whether the Court of Appeal’s decision was correct.  REASONS  [1] While the approved question is general, the Court is particularly interested in hearing from the parties in relation to the following issues:  (a)  whether, given the more limited role attributed to Mr Berkland by the Court of Appeal (compared to that of his co-offender), sufficient weight was placed on that factor in setting the starting point;   (b)  whether the Court of Appeal applied the correct approach to personal mitigating circumstances in relation to Mr Berkland, and in particular    WILLIAM ALLAN BERKLAND v R [2020] NZSC 125 [17 November 2020]  in requiring a causal link between his addiction or history of deprivation and the offending; and  (c) whether the Court of Appeal was correct to uphold the imposition of a minimum period of imprisonment.  [2] It will be clear from the foregoing that it is not intended that this appeal should proceed as a wholesale re-litigation of the Court of Appeal’s guideline judgment in Zhang v R.1  Solicitors: Ord Legal, Wellington for Applicant Crown Law Office, Wellington for Respondent  Zhang v R [2019] NZCA 507, [2019] 3 NZLR 648.

SF Gilbert, Hamilton.  MANGA v POLICE [2020] NZHC 2882 [3 November 2020]  [1] On 17 August 2020, Rocky Manga appeared for sentence on seven offences: possession of methamphetamine; possession of a pipe; breaching a protection order; assault; driving while forbidden; failing to stop; and reckless driving. Judge D M Wilson QC imposed a term of 12 months’ intensive supervision and 80 hours’ community work.  In relation to the last two charges mentioned—failing to stop and reckless driving—the Judge disqualified Mr Manga from driving for two and a half years.  Mr Manga appeals this aspect alone.  He contends the Judge was without jurisdiction to disqualify him for this long.  The Crown agrees.  [2] The failing to stop offence was the first of its kind for Mr Manga.  So, ss 52A(1)(a)(ii) and 52A(3) of the Land Transport Act 1998 required a period of disqualification of six months.  The reckless driving offence carried a maximum penalty of at least six months’ disqualification.  Under s 52A(6) of the Land Transport Act, the Judge was required to make these cumulative.  So, the logical sentence was a period of 12 months’ disqualification.  [3] Mr Manga was sentenced in a busy list.  The Judge might have thought the failing to stop offence alleged a third or subsequent offence.  Had this been so, the sentence would have been unremarkable.  [4] Given the acknowledged mistake, the appeal is allowed.  The sentence of two and a half years’ disqualification is quashed.  It is replaced with a period of 12 months’ disqualification.  No other aspect of the sentence is changed.  It follows Mr Manga continues to serve a term of 12 months’ intensive supervision and 80 hours’ community work.  …………………………….. Downs J

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI PIRA O AOTEAROA CA304/2020 [2020] NZCA 521  BETWEEN  PETER RICHARD PRESCOTT Appellant   AND  VIOLET GEORGINATHOMPSON First Respondent   AND  DISTRICT COURTATAUCKLAND Second Respondent   Counsel:  Appellant in person R E Harrison QC for First Respondent   Judgment:  23 October 2020 at 11.00 am    (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OFMILLER J (Review of Registrar’s Decision)  The application for review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision is declined.   REASONS  [1] Mr Prescott applies for a review of the Deputy Registrar’s “decision” to abandon his appeal.    Background  [2] Mr Prescott filed a claim in the District Court that his former partner, MsThompson, had made a contractually binding promise that she would sell him a property at a certain value. Before this matter could be heard in the District Court, MrPrescottmade several unsuccessful attempts to adjourn the fixture. Thehearing  PETER RICHARD PRESCOTTvVIOLETGEORGINATHOMPSON [2020] NZCA521[23October 2020]  proceeded and a judgment subsequently issued in favour of Ms Thompson.1 MrPrescott filed judicial review proceedings, alleging that the District Court’s decision to not adjourn thehearingforhis claim was unreasonable. On 15 May2020, Palmer J dismissed the application for judicial review.2  [3] Mr Prescott filed an appeal against this decision on 8 June 2020.  Therequirements of r 43(1)of the Court ofAppeal (Civil) Rules 2005 of applyingfor the allocation of a hearing date and filing the case on appeal were not complied with in the prescribed three-month period. Accordingly, the appeal wasdeemed abandoned on 8September 2020.  The “Noticeof Result” communicatingthis to the parties was signed by the Deputy Registrar.   [4] Mr Prescott seeks a review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision.3 He submits that it was due to extenuating circumstances that he was unable to comply with therequirements imposed by r 43.   Analysis  [5] Theapplication forreview cannotsucceed. Thereis no decision ofthe Deputy Registrar to review. Mr Prescott’s appeal was abandoned by operation of law due to his failure to comply with the requirements of r 43. If Mr Prescott wishes to remedy this situation, he must make an application for an extension of time to comply with r43 by 8 December 2020.4 I do not encourage him to apply; he failed on the facts, and in my opinion his appeal has no merit.  However, it is his right to do so.   Result  [6] The application for review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision is declined.

[3] Charges 3, 7, 9, 10, 12 and 15 are dismissed, together with charges 8, 11, 13, 14 and 17 to 19 addressed in my ruling yesterday.  [4] My reasons will be available in a separate reasons judgment to be released through the Registry today.  Gault J  1 R v Ross HC Auckland CRI-2019-092-2113, Trial Minute / Ruling (No. 5) 21 October 2020. My earlier ruling indicated that charges 8, 11, 13, 14 and 17 to 19 should be dismissed on the basis that there is no evidence upon which a properly directed jury could reasonably convict.  2 The relevant charges are: Charge 3: Between 3 February and 20 February 2019 at Wiri, unlawfully detained [A] without her consent or with her consent obtained by duress, with intent to cause her to be confined or imprisoned – a representative charge. Charge 7: Between 3 February and 20 February 2019 at Wiri, assaulted [B] with intent to injure her – namely punching her – a representative charge. Charge 9: Between 3 February and 20 February 2019 at Wiri, intentionally impeded the normal breathing of [B] by applying pressure to her throat or neck – a representative charge. Charge 10: Between 3 February and 20 February 2019 at Wiri, sexually violated [B] by raping her – a representative charge. Charge 12: Between 3 February and 20 February 2019 at Wiri, sexually violated [B] by unlawful sexual connection – namely the insertion of his finger(s) into her vagina – a representative charge. Charge 15: Between 3 February and 20 February 2019 at Wiri, sexually violated [B] by unlawful sexual connection – namely connection between the complainant’s mouth and the defendant’s penis – a representative charge. 
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY  ITE KOTI MATUAOAOTEAROA TAMAKI MAKAURAU ROHE CIV-2020-404-1379 [2020] NZHC 2777  UNDER The Residential Tenancies Act 1986  IN THE MATTER Of an appeal against a decision of the Auckland District Court  BETWEEN  KATE CULLUM Appellant   AND  KIRI BARFOOT Respondent   Hearing:  20 October 2020    Appearances: No appearance by or on behalf of the Applicant M Singh for the Respondent  Judgment: 22 October 2020  JUDGMENTOFPOWELL J  This judgment was delivered by me on 22 October 2020 at 3.30 pm pursuant to R 11.5 of the High Court Rules  Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date:  CULLUM v BARFOOT [2020] NZHC 2777 [22 October 2020]  [1] This application for leave to appeal had been adjourned from 15 September 2020 following the non-appearance of the applicant, Kate Cullum.  My Minute of 15 September 2020 noted a number of issues with the appeal on which I required further information and indicated that if Ms Cullum failed to appear when the appeal was next called on 20 October 2020 it would be likely that the appeal would be struck out without further notice to her.  [2] In the event Ms Cullum filed a 22-page document entitled “Public memorandum” on 6 October 2020 in which she confirmed that she would not be appearing at the next call of the proceedings.  Despite the length of the document it did not address any of the issues identified in my Minute.  Instead Ms Cullum spent considerable time addressing an unrelated appeal that had previously been struck out,1 made a range of complaints with regard to the court process generally, and made personal attacks on a range of individuals including the respondent, the respondent’s solicitor, the principal Tenancy Tribunal adjudicator, the District Court Judge whose decision Ms Cullum sought leave to appeal, the Deputy Registrar responsible for the civil appeals list in the Auckland High Court and myself.  [3] In the circumstances, faced with Ms Cullum’s wilful non-attendance and her failure to address any of the procedural matters requiring resolution, I conclude that allowing Ms Cullum’s application to remain extant can serve no useful purpose. Instead I conclude, in the light of the documents filed by Ms Cullum, the appropriate course is to strike out the application as an abuse of the Court process.2  [4] The application for leave to appeal is therefore struck out and I make an order for costs on a 2B basis in favour of the respondent.  Powell J  1 Cullum v Gordon [2020] NZHC 1261.  2 The application is struck out pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of this Court. See Siemer v Stiassny [2011] NZCA 1 at [15] where the Court of Appeal confirmed the strike out power found in the High Court Rules 2016 does not affect the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court to strike out a proceeding (or in this case an application) irrespective of any application for strike out by either of the parties.   
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANA NUI SC 13/2020 [2020] NZSC 112  BETWEEN DAVID SIMON BARTON Applicant AND THE QUEEN Respondent Court: Glazebrook, Ellen France and Williams JJ Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment: 16 October 2020  JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  The second application for recall of this Court’s judgment of 21 August 2020 (Barton v R [2020] NZSC 84) is dismissed.   REASONS  [1] On 31 August 2020, this Court dismissed Mr Barton’s application forrecall of this Court’s leave judgment of 21 August 2020.1  [2] Mr Barton now applies for recall of both the recall and leave judgments.  [3] Mr Barton effectively repeats his submissions he made earlier that were rejected. They do not, therefore, provide aground for recall.2  [4] Therewas onenew submission raised:Mr Barton’s request for adetermination on s 17 of the CrimesAct1961, which provides that no offendershallbesentenced to  1 Barton v R [2020] NZSC 87 (Glazebrook, Ellen France and Williams JJ); and Barton v R [2020] NZSC 84 (Glazebrook, Ellen France and WilliamsJJ).  2 Uhrle v R [2020] NZSC 62 at [29].

Mr Barton was not, however, sentenced to solitaryconfinement. Hewas sentenced to three years, two months and two weeks’imprisonment.3 Failureof his counsel to draw the Court’s attention to s 17 of the Crimes Act 1961 therefore does not provide a ground for recall.  [5] Thesecond application for recallof this Court’s judgment of 21 August2020 is therefore dismissed.  [6] We direct the Registrar to reject any further application for recall of the leave judgment of 21 August 2020 and for the recall of the recall judgments, including this judgment.

B The reference is to be heard in conjunction with Solicitor-General’s Reference CA397/2020 on 22 October 2020.  The registry is to appoint counsel to assist the Court, being the same counsel assisting with respect to Solicitor-General’s Reference CA397/2020.    REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given by Kós P)  [1] On 5 August 2020, this Court granted leave to the Solicitor-General to refer two questions of law concerning the admissibility of evidential breath tests in circumstances where the advice given to motorists under s 77 of the Land Transport Act 1998 differed from the statutory language.1 That reference, Solicitor-General’s Reference CA397/2020, is to be heard by this Court on 22 October 2020, and counsel assisting has been appointed as contradictor.  [2] The Solicitor-General now seeks leave to refer a further question under s313(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, arising from the decision of Judge Gibson in the District Court at Auckland in Police v Neutze. 2 The question posed is:  Was the Judge correct to find that the evidential blood sample obtained following the procedure in Police Procedure Sheet POL515 09/19 was inadmissible by reason only of the wording of BlockJ?  [3] We are satisfied the criteria for leave under s 313(1) are met. The reference raises a related but distinct question to those being considered in Solicitor-General’s Reference CA397/2020. Leave to refer is granted.  [4] We direct that the reference is to be heard in conjunction with Solicitor-General’s Reference CA397/2020 on 22 October 2020. The registry is to appoint counsel to assist the Court,3 being the same counsel assisting with respect to Solicitor-General’s Reference CA397/2020.

MATAURAVALLEYMILK LIMITED v GRAHAM SCOTT[2020] NZEmpC 152[25 September 2020]  to review. The purpose of that review is, according to the application, to identify whether Mataura’s confidential information has been incorporated into the emails or attachments in the account.  [3] Four conditions are proposed as part of the application as follows:  (a)  The inspected files are not to be copied (in whole or in part).   (b)  The files are only to be inspected at the office of Wynn Williams and, at all times, that inspection is to be supervised by Mr Campbell, the independent solicitor.   (c)  Any notes made by Mr May to assist him duringthe inspection are not to be removed from the office of Wyn Williams and are to be retained by the independent solicitor.   (d)  There is to be no disclosure of thecontent of information inspected by Mr May to any person (with the exception of counsel) unless first authorised by the Court.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date……………  Solicitors: Thomson Wilson, Whangarei  BURMESTER v NORSAND LIMITED [2020] NZHC 2467[22September 2020]  [1] On 5 August 2020 I issued a judgment dismissing an appeal by Mr Burmester against the decision given by Judge G M Harrison in the District Court on 5 December 2019.1  [2] I have now received the memoranda filed by counsel for the respondent and by Mr Burmester in relation to the issue of costs. The respondent seeks costs on a Category 2B basis together with disbursements.  Mr Burmester opposes any award of costs being made.  [3] The respondent was plainly the successful party and should receive an award of costs. With two exceptions, I award the respondent costs on a Category 2B basis for the steps set out in the memorandum of counsel for the respondent dated 14 August 2020.  [4] The first exception is that I decline to allow costs in relation to the preparation of written submissions in opposition to Mr Burmester’s interlocutory application seeking leave to adduce fresh evidence. From my reading of the file, that application was never timetabled through to a separate hearing.  Rather, all matters were heard at the substantive hearing. I am satisfied an award of three days to cover all written submissions is sufficient. Secondly, I do not recall any case on appeal having been filed.  Rather, it was necessary for me to rely on the material contained in the District Court file together with that filed in support of the appeal.  I therefore decline to grant costs in relation to the preparation of the case on appeal.  Lang J  Burmester v Norsand Ltd [2020] NZHC 1945.

REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byMiller J)  [1] Mr Sumovesforrecallofthis Court’s judgment of 30 April2020, in whichhis appeal against sentence was allowed and a sentence of five years imprisonment substituted.1  Su v R [2020] NZCA128.  [2] Mr Hooker, who appears for Mr Su, says that there was a mathematical error in the Court’s sentence. The calculation should have resulted in a sentence of four years, eleven months imprisonment. The recall application also seeks to reopen the judgment, saying that the Court wrongly found Mr Su to be a driver and further that he ought to have been heard on sentence if the Court was not to apply a discount for addiction which had been applied by the High Court.  [3] The short answer to the application is that there is no calculation error.  TheCourt rounded up the sentence calculation to achieve what it considered the appropriate sentence in the circumstances. That is the objective of sentencing.  [4] Insofar as Mr Su seeks to reopen the judgment, recall is not an appropriate remedy. Following the Supreme Court judgment in Uhrle, 2 an applicant must show that a substantial injustice has probably occurred as a result of this Court’s judgment.  A challenge to the merits must be made byway of appeal, not recall. MrSu’s pursuit of an additional discount is adirect challenge to this Court’s findingthat addiction did not haveacausallink to theoffending. Hisremedyis an application forleavetoappeal to the Supreme Court.  [5] The application for recall is declined.

No other response is forthcoming.  [3] I have reviewed the receivers’ costs claim, calculated for 2B steps in the proceeding, and note the receivers’ acknowledgments steps now claimed cannot be claimed againonanycostsclaim onthe balanceof their causes ofaction, and expenses incurred exceed costs claimed.

No disbursements are sought.  [3] Mr Zhangresponded bywayof an email to the Registry. Hedoes not dispute Telco’s calculation but says that he ought not to have to pay costs because there was no order to that effect in the judgment. He invites the Court to ignore Telco’s costs memorandum.   [4] The fact that no order was made in the judgment of 8 June 2020 does not precludeTelco from applyingfor costsby wayof memorandum, which is quiteusual.  Costs are at the discretion of the Court but normally determined in accordance with the principles stated in the Rules.3 Relevantly, the general principle is that the party who fails in an appeal or application should paycosts to the party who succeeds.   [5] Mr Zhang’s application forleaveto appeal posed morethan adozen questions of law. Nonehad anymeritbut Telco had to respond to them nevertheless. There is no good reason to depart from the usual principle. There is an order for costs in accordance with Telco’s memorandum as to costs dated 10 June 2020.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANANUI SC 13/2020 [2020] NZSC 87  BETWEEN DAVID SIMON BARTON Applicant AND THE QUEEN Respondent Court: Glazebrook, Ellen France and Williams JJ Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment: 31 August 2020  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall of this Court’s judgment of 21 August 2020 (Barton v R [2020] NZSC 84) is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] On 21 August 2020 this Court dismissed Mr Barton’s application for leave to  appeal.1 He applies for a recall of that judgment.2  [2] The general rule is that a judgment, once delivered, must stand for better or  worse.3 There are, however, three categories of cases where a judgment may be  recalled: a legislative amendment or a new development in case law of “high  authority”; a failure by counsel to draw attention to a relevant statutory provision or  1 Barton v R [2020] NZSC 84 (Glazebrook, Ellen France and Williams JJ).  2 The recall application has been dealt with by the panel who sat on the leave application and so it has not been placed before Winkelmann CJ as requested.  3 Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2) [1968] NZLR 632 (SC) at 633; see as cited in Craig v Williams [2019] NZSC 60 at [10].  DAVID SIMON BARTON v R [2020] NZSC 87 [31 August 2020]  caselaw; or “where for some other very special reason justice requires that the judgment be recalled”.4  [3] Most of the matters Mr Barton seeks to raise have already been considered and rejected by the Court. To the extent that is not the case, they are matters that could have been raised earlier. None of the grounds for recall are made out.  [4] The application for recall of our judgment of 21 August 2020 is therefore dismissed.

The appellant, Auckland Christian Fellowship and Recreations, failed to appear when the appeal was listed on two occasions following its unsuccessful application for a non-lawyer to represent it in the appeal.1  [2] The respondent Commissioner has now sought costs on a 2B basis.  The Commissioner’s application has been referred to the appellant and to Mr Devathasan who had sought leave to represent the appellant in the proceedings, but no steps have been taken to oppose the costs sought.  [3] Having considered the quantum of costs sought I am satisfied the amounts sought are appropriate and therefore order the appellant, Auckland Christian Fellowship and Recreations to pay to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue costs in the sum of $4,063.00 together with disbursements in the sum of $1,179.65, being a total of $5,242.65.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date……………  Solicitors: Adina Thorn,Auckland McElroys,Auckland  MCCORMACK vMAYNARD MARKS LTD [2020] NZHC 2115[20August 2020]  [1] This proceeding has been referred to me to deal with the outstanding issue of costs in relation to the application forfurther and better particulars that was scheduled to be heard on 26 August 2020. The application was withdrawn after the plaintiffs filed asecond amended statement of claim on8 July2020. Thedefendantaccepts that the amended statement of claim contains the particulars it was seeking in its application. It has therefore withdrawn the application but seeks costs.  [2] Theplaintiffs deny costs are payable. In the alternative, they say costs should bereserved and determined after trial.  [3] I do not accept that costs should be reserved because, so far as possible, the determination of costs should be both predictable and expeditious.1  [4] I am satisfied the defendant was effectively the successful party in the application because the application prompted the filing of the second amended statement of claim. The plaintiffs filed this approximately two weeks after the defendant filed the application seeking further and better particulars. The defendant should therefore receive costs on the withdrawn application on a Category 2B basis together with disbursements.  I award costs as follows:  (a)  Preparation of interlocutory application (0.6 x $2,390) $1,434   (b)  Filing fee and interlocutory application $ 500    $1,934  [5] I decline to award costs on the memorandum dealing with costs.

ORDER PROHIBITING PUBLICATION OF THE JUDGMENT AND ANY PART OF THE PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING THE RESULT) IN NEWS MEDIA OR ON THE INTERNET OR OTHER PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATABASE UNTIL FINAL DISPOSITION OF TRIAL. PUBLICATION IN LAW REPORT OR LAW DIGEST PERMITTED.  IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANANUI SC 1/2020 [2020] NZSC 79  BETWEEN PETER DANIEL HARRISON Applicant AND THE QUEEN Respondent Court: Glazebrook, O’Regan and Williams JJ Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment: 7 August 2020  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A  The second application for recall of this Court’s judgment of 6 May 2020 (Harrison v R [2020] NZSC 43) is dismissed.   B  We make an order prohibiting publication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in news media or on the internet or other publicly available database until final disposition of trial.  Publication in law report or law digest is permitted.     REASONS  [1] On 6 May 2020, this Court dismissed Mr Harrison’s applications for leave to  appeal against decisions of the Court of Appeal and the District Court.1 Mr Harrison  Harrison v R [2020] NZSC 43 (Glazebrook, O’Regan and Williams JJ) [SC leave judgment]. See also Harrison v R [2019] NZCA 534 (Collins J); and R v Harrison [2019] NZDC 9601 (Judge Gilbert).  PETER DANIEL HARRISON v R [2020] NZSC 79 [7 August 2020]  sought to be tried in absentia, after absconding while awaiting trial some 30 years ago. This Court held that, even assuming there was jurisdiction to hear Mr Harrison’s proposed appeal, the criteria for leave to appeal were not met.2  [2] On 21 May 2020 and 4 June 2020, Mr Harrison requested this Court rehear the matter. We treated those email requests post-judgment as an application to recall our judgment of 6 May 2020.  [3] None of the grounds for recall were made out and the application for recall of our judgment of 6 May 2020 was dismissed on 23 June 2020.3  [4] On 2 August 2020, Mr Harrison requested a further recall of the 6 May 2020 judgment. The new application for recall does not raise any matter than would justify the recall of this Court’s judgment. The current application is the third request for rehearing or recall in respect of the 6 May 2020 judgment.  Repeated applications to recall a leave judgment are an abuse of process.4 The application for recall is therefore dismissed.  [5] We direct the Registrar to reject any further application for recall of the judgment of 6 May 2020.  [6] For fair trial reasons, we make an order prohibiting publication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in news media or on the internet or other publicly available database until final disposition of the trial.

[2] The respondent has now applied for costs against the applicants on a 2B basis in the total sum of $17,686.2 The applicants have not taken any steps to oppose the costs sought.   [3] As the respondent has noted the parties had previously agreed that costs should be appropriately categorised as 2B. On this basis, and having checked the amounts sought, I am satisfied that the costs claimed are both reasonable and appropriate. Accordingly, the respondent is entitled to judgment for costs against the applicants in the sum of $17,686.   Powell J  1 Jiang v Chief Executive of the Ministry of Business [2020] NZHC 1439.  2 The respondent sought costs of $17,686 inclusive of GST, however, utilising the schedule provided by the respondent this sum is in fact simply the relevant scale costs calculated in accordance with sch 3 of the High Court Rules 2016, and an award of scale costs is GST neutral.

[2] Fairview has now applied for costs on a 2B basis in the sum of $8,365. Mr Singh has not taken any steps to oppose the costs sought.   [3] Having considered Fairview’s application I am satisfied that an award of costs is appropriate and the amount sought is reasonable.  Accordingly, Fairview is entitled to costs against Mr Singh in the sum of $8,365.00, and judgment is given for this sum.  [4] It is also appropriate to grant the order sought by Fairview, that the security for costs currently held by the Court, being $1,195.00, be released to Fairview and deducted from the judgment sum owing; leaving a balance of $7,170.00 outstanding.

Mr Poros would have been ordered to paythem costs in the amount of $26,768, plus disbursements of $609.36, if his liabilityforcostshad not been affected bythat section.  [3] For the respondents, Deborah Chambers QC quantifies their category 2 costs on band B’s time allocations, increased to band C for preparation of written submissions in response to Mr Poros’discursive submissions.Iaccept acomparatively large amount of time for written submissions in response is considered reasonable,3 justifying band C for that step.  [4] For Mr Poros, Jeremy Noble argues against any costs liability on grounds of Ms Bax’s alleged conduct in the FamilyCourt, being such if engaged in byMr Poros would haverendered himliable to costsnotwithstandinghis status asan aided person.4 Mr Noble concedes no such disqualifying behaviour continued in the High Court, but contends no award of costs nonetheless is justified here.  [5] Costs are awarded only with respect to steps taken in this Court. The respondents, however, failed on theircross-appeal,makingthem liable for some costs to Mr Poros. Although none is claimed, a comparatively small amount of time is considered reasonable for steps on his response to the cross-appeal, justifying band Atime allocations for steps 53 and 56, amount to 1.5 days, or $3,585, to be deducted from the respondents’claim.  [6] I therefore order an order for costs in the amount of $23,183.00, plus disbursements in the amount of $609.36,would havebeen madeagainstMr Poros with respect to this proceeding if s 45 had not affected his liability.  —Jagose J  1  Legal ServicesAct 2011, s 45.   2  Poros v Bax [2020] NZHC 1602 at [70].   3  At [18]–[19].   4  Legal ServicesAct 2011, s 45(2) and (3).

Pursuant to Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules.  ………………………….. Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Counsel:  RO Parmenter Barrister,Auckland  WATI vSHARMA[2020] NZHC 1847[28 July2020]  [1] Myjudgment of 2 July2020 in Ms Wati’s favour took the preliminary views, as the successful party, she was entitled to 1Bcosts and disbursements for steps taken on the appeal, as the appeal was of a straightforward nature occupying a normal amountof time, excludingstep 57 as Idid not requireto hearfrom Ms Wati’scounsel, Ray Parmenter.1  [2] I calculated such costs from a five-daytime allocation at a daily recovery rate of $1,590 to amount to $7,950 or such lesser sum as Ms Wati actually incurred (plus disbursements as allowedbythe Registrar),but reserved costs if that was not accepted by the parties, or they could not otherwise agree. 2  [3] Mr Parmenter proposes to reinstate step 57 as he was required to be present and had to refresh himself on the morningof the hearing. But the latteris preparation, and I did not require to hear from him. Some reduction is justified.  [4] Mr Parmenter also supplements my calculation by including time allocations for call memoranda and for sealing the judgment. I apprehend he is correct, taking costs to $9,222. Mr Parmenter seeks only costs of $9,000 on the appeal, plus $318 as costs on his costs memorandum. I accept his advice Ms Wati’s expenses exceed that sum.  [5] I understand the Registry in error initially sealed an order for costs sought by Mr Parmenter. As my judgment directed, the order should not have been sought or made except with Mr Sharma’s agreement. Be that as it may, that now has been undone. Mr Parmenter’s contribution to the incorrect sealing also should be met with some sanction, and I will not allow costs on the costs application.  [6] I therefore order Mr Sharma to pay Ms Wati costs in the amount of $9,000 (plus disbursements as allowed by the Registrar).  —Jagose J  1 Wati v Sharma [2020] NZHC 1545 at[11]. 2 At [12].

B The approved question is whether the Court of Appeal was correct to dismiss the appeal.  REASONS  [1] To assist counsel in preparing for the appeal, the Court notes the following points:  (a) The principles of contractual interpretation have been set out by this Court in Firm PI 1 Ltd v Zurich Australian Insurance Ltd (Zurich).1 We will not revisit those principles on this appeal.

Thedocument is handwritten and purports to be a will. It is witnessed by two persons but does not on its face record that each witness attested the will in the presence of each other.  [2] Evidence is filed on this application by the two witnesses and a third person who was present. All confirm that the two witnesses were present at the same time. In terms of s 14 of theAct there are no circumstances that suggest the document does not contain the testamentary wishes of Mr Peryer.  [3] Pursuant to s 14 of the Wills Act 2007, Ideclare the document appended to the affidavit of Clovis Eugene Peryer, dated 14 February 2020, and annexed as Annexure Ato be a valid will of Mr Peter Chanel Peryer.  [4] Idaw the parties’ attention to s13 of the Wills Act. Adisposition contained withinthe document is to one of the two witnesses.  The disposition is therefore void, although s13(2)identifies avenues of relief. Thefact that abeneficiaryis awitness does not invalidate the will, just the particular disposition. I accordingly did not consider this irregularity affected the s 14 application.  [5] I make the necessary preliminary orders that the application may be made without notice to any person. All parties affected by the issue have consented to the s14 application.   Simon France J  Solicitors: RMYLegal, New Plymouth forApplicant

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors/Counsel: LawWorks, Auckland. Anthony Harper, Auckland. DR Bigio QC, Auckland.  SAIN v MILLIE ERCEG TRUSTEE LTD [2020] NZHC 1778 [22 July 2020]  [1] Ms Sain successfully applied to sustain a caveat on the title to a home. She seeks 2B costs in relation to her application.  The respondent contends costs should be determined at the end of the trial, when the outcome is known, as Ms Sain’s (substantive) claim hinges on credibility determinations.  The respondent also cites delay on Ms Sain’s part.  [2] I award Ms Sain 2B costs for the simple reason she was successful.1 If the respondent succeeds at trial, it will have trial costs.  …………………………….. Downs J  Rule 14.2(1)(a), High Court Rules 2016.

IN THE HIGH COURT OFNEWZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TEWHANGANUI-A-TARAROHE  CIV-2020-485-341 [2020] NZHC 1714   INTHE MATTER of Section 14 of the Wills Act 2007  AND   INTHE MATTER of an application by Carl Read-Jones for an order that a document bedeclared a valid will (in original form) of the deceased Barry Cyril Jones of Waikanae, New Zealand, Deceased  On the papers  Counsel: C D Bennett for Applicant  Judgment: 16 July 2020    JUDGMENT OFSIMON FRANCE J  [1] This is an application to declare a document found amongst the papers of the late Barry Cyril Jones to be a valid will.   [2] The 2018 document in issue declares itself to be a will. It is typed, but is not professionally prepared. The document is witnessed by two witnesses.  Although it declares that the witnesses signedin thepresence of each other and the testator, that is not so. They signed at different times, but on each occasion in the presence of the testator who was known to them.  [3] That is not the onlyissue. Thetyped version leaves the estate, 50 per cent to a daughter and 25 per cent to each of two step-sons. There has subsequently been a handwritten alteration leavingthe estate 75 per cent to the daughter and 12.5 per cent to each of the two step-sons. Onewitness recalls that the document was in its original unamended state when she signed. The other cannot recall. I note, however, the handwritten alterations are signed by the testator and not the witnesses, suggesting they were made subsequent to the original witnessing.  [4] The three named beneficiaries are also the named executors.  One has brought the application to have the document, as amended, declared to be a valid will of MrBarryCyril Jones. Theother twoconsent to theapplication. Oneof the witnesses to the document says the original content accorded with discussions she had had with the testator. Thereis no reason to querythe subsequent amendments which aresigned by the testator.   [5] I am satisfied the document as amended expresses the testamentaryintentions of Mr Jones and should be declared to be a valid will. There is no basis to consider those intentions changed since the document was placed in its current form.  Ancillary orders  [6] The application may be made without notice to any otherparties.   Order  [7] I declare the document intituled “The Last Will of Barry Cyril Jones”, being exhibit A to the affidavit of Carl Read-Jones, to be a valid will.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND   I TE KOTI PIRA O AOTEAROA  CA703/2018 [2020] NZCA 282   BETWEEN  ABDUL JAVED Appellant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Court:  French, Courtney and Goddard JJ   Counsel:  Appellant in person E J Hoskin for Respondent   Judgment: (On the papers)  13 July 2020 at 9 am    JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  A  The application for leave to withdraw the notice of abandonment of appeal   dated 22 June 2020 is granted and the appeal is reinstated.   B  The Registrar is to allocate a new hearing date after mid-September 2020   and if possible in Wellington.    REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byFrench J)  [1] Mr Javed is a self-represented appellant.  [2] His appeal was due to be heard on 23 July 2020 in Auckland.  [3] On 22 June2020, MrJaved signed and filedanoticeofabandonment ofappeal.  TheCourt then issued anoticeofresult certifyingthat the appeal had been abandoned.  JAVED v R [2020] NZCA282[13 July2020]  [4] Subsequently, Mr Javed wrote to the Court asking for his appeal to be reinstated. In his letter, he explains that he is in the middle of a drug treatment programme at Rimutaka prison where he is being held and so could not attend a hearing in Auckland. Heasks that the appeal bereinstated and given anew hearing date after his drug treatment programme finishes in mid-September or that itbe given aWellington fixture  [5] The Crown accepts that Mr Javed appears to have intended to abandon the hearingdate —that is,seek an adjournment —ratherthan abandon theappeal entirely. It therefore does not oppose the application for reinstatement.  [6] We are satisfied that in all the circumstances it would be in the interests of justice to allow Mr Javed to withdraw his notice of abandonment.  [7] Theapplication for leaveto withdraw the noticeof abandonment is accordingly granted and the appeal reinstated. We also direct the Registrar to allocate a new hearing date after mid-September 2020 and if possible in Wellington.  Solicitors: Crown Law Office,Wellington for Respondent  
IN THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS AUTHORITY CHRISTCHURCH  I TE RATONGA AHUMANA TAIMAHI OTAUTAHI ROHE  [2020] NZERA 2743061273  BETWEEN BRIAR LECKIE Applicant  AND  ALLIANCE GROUP LIMITED   Respondent   Member of Authority:  Philip Cheyne   Representatives:  Mary-Jane Thomas, counsel for Applicant   Ken Smith, counsel for Respondent   Determination:  7 July 2020    DETERMINATION OF THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS AUTHORITY   A. Alliance Group Limited is to pay Briar Leckie $53,944.97 gross, pursuant to s 123(1)(b) of the Employment Relations Act 2000.  B. Alliance Group Limited is to pay Briar Leckie costs of $3,822.00, reimburse her for Authority meetings fees charged and pay her a further $71.56 for the Authority application fee.  [1] In a determination dated 5 June 2020 I found that Ms Leckie had personal grievances against Alliance Group Limited. The claim for reimbursement of lost remuneration was reserved for further consideration.  Costs were also reserved.  [2] These issues were canvassed during a conference with counsel today.  [3] There is agreement between counsel that taking the earlier findings together with the seasonal work dates, deducting Ms Leckie’s other earnings and applying the deduction for contribution generates a gross figure of $53,944.97 in lost remuneration. I fix that figure as the proven loss which Alliance is to pay Ms Leckie.  [4] Counsel for Ms Leckie advises that legal aid costs are $3,822.00. Ms Leckie was invoiced other charges for work on these proceedings before legal aid was fixed. Counsel sought $3,822.00 in costs. That figure is less than would apply on a daily tariff basis.  Counsel for Alliance did not oppose an award of costs of $3,822.00. I fix that amount as the figure of costs which Alliance should pay to Mr Leckie.  [5] Alliance should also reimburse Ms Leckie for the meeting and application fees charged by the Authority.  [6] I note that Alliance challenges the finding that the assessment of Ms Leckie’s lost remuneration should cover from the date of dismissal until the date of the investigation meeting. The level of contribution is also challenged. The agreement expressed in [3] leading to this determination does not affect the parties’ rights on the challenge.

Pursuant to Rule 11.5 High Court Rules  Registrar/Deputy Registrar  FUATI v PENG [2020] NZHC 1581 [6 July 2020]  [1] This is a costs judgment consequent on my judgment delivered 1 April 2020.  [2] The defendants seek costs in respect of the plaintiffs’ application “for enforcement of a discovery order”. My judgment deemed this application abandoned after the plaintiffs did not file submissions before the hearing without satisfactory explanation.  [3] The second defendant seeks costs in respect of the successful applications for leave, particular discovery and substituted service.  [4] In both instances, 2B costs and disbursements are sought.  [5] The defendants have made efforts to resolve the question of costs with the plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs have had sufficient time to respond to the cost memorandum. They have been reminded to do so. The successful party is entitled to an award. I am satisfied that it is appropriate to fix these in accordance with the schedules presented by the defendants.  [6] I award the defendants costs and disbursements of $3,815.20 against the plaintiffs jointly and severally in respect of the plaintiffs’ abandoned application.  [7] I award the first defendant costs and disbursements of $10,341.20 against the plaintiffs jointly and severally in respect of the first defendant’s applications.  [8] The defendants sought a modest award of 0.3 day under category 2 for the cost memorandum. While I accept that the plaintiffs’ failure to engage on the question of costs led to a more comprehensive memorandum, I am not prepared in this instance to include an award for costs on costs.   .......................................................

B The approved questions are:  (i)  whether the Court of Appeal was correct to refuse leave to adduce the evidence of Mr Wilson and, if so, whether a miscarriage of justice arose as a result of this evidence not being before the jury at the applicant’s trial; and   (ii)  whether the Court of Appeal was correct to conclude that evidence of the complainants’ previous convictions was inadmissible at the applicant’s trial, or that, if any of it was admissible, its exclusion did not cause a miscarriage of justice.    PENIAMINA IEREMIA v R [2020] NZSC 60 [3 July 2020]  REASONS  [1] The issues on which the applicant sought leave to appeal are:  (a)  the Court of Appeal’s refusal to give leave to adduce the evidence of Mr Wilson on the basis that it was not cogent;   (b)  the Court of Appeal’s refusal to give leave to adduce the evidence of a memory expert, Dr Strange, on the basis it was not cogent;1 and   (c)  the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that evidence of the previous convictions of the complainants would not have been substantially helpful to the jury and that the absence of this evidence at the trial did not have any impact on the verdicts.    [2] We have granted leave on the first and third grounds.  [3] We are not satisfied that the leave criteria are met in relation to the second ground. The focus of Dr Strange’s evidence was on statements made by the complainants in their initial police interviews about “blocking out” memories of the offending against them.  There was no cross-examination of the complainants about these statements or on the topic of recovered memory.  This was unsurprising given the defence case was about the credibility of the complainants and the allegation they had colluded for financial gain.  As this Court noted in B (SC 18/2020) v R, the admissibility of expert memory evidence at trial may be a topic that should be considered by this Court but, as in that case, we do not see the present case as an appropriate vehicle for that to occur.2  Solicitors: Crown Law Office, Wellington for Respondent  1 The Court of Appeal heard the present appeal at the same time as B (CA463/2018) v R [2020] NZCA 18, in which the appellant had also sought to adduce evidence of Dr Strange. An application for leave to appeal against that decision to this Court has been dismissed: B (SC 18/2020) v R [2020] NZSC 52.  2 B (SC 18/2020), above n 1, at [14].

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors: Meredith Connell (Auckland) for Respondent  GREEN v CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS [2020] NZHC 1514 [30 June 2020]  [1] This is a costs judgment.  [2] In my judgment of 25 March 2020,1 I dismissed Mr Green’s application for judicial review against the Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections.  The subject-matter of Mr Green’s application was his dissatisfaction with the way probation officers were administering a special release condition imposed by a District Court Judge pursuant to s 93(2)(b) of the Sentencing Act 2002.  [3] Because this was a civil matter, I said:  [23] If there is any issue as to costs, the respondent is to file its memorandum no later than 8 May 2020.  If a memorandum is filed, Mr Green is to file his reply no later than 22 May 2020.  [4] On 3 April 2020 the respondent filed a memorandum seeking costs.  Nothing has been received from Mr Green.  [5] The respondent seeks costs on a 2B basis.  In my view that is the appropriate scale and I approve the time allocations set out in the respondent’s memorandum.   Decision  [6] I award costs in favour of the respondent in the sum of $16,371.50.  [7] Mr Green must pay the respondent’s disbursements in the sum of $160.

PUBLICATION IN LAW REPORT OR LAW DIGEST PERMITTED.  IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANANUI SC 1/2020 [2020] NZSC 59  BETWEEN PETER DANIEL HARRISON Applicant AND THE QUEEN Respondent Court: Glazebrook, O’Regan and Williams JJ Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment: 23 June 2020  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A  The application for recall of our judgment of 6 May 2020 (Harrison v R [2020] NZSC 43) is dismissed.   B  We make an order prohibiting publication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in news media or on the internet or other publicly available database until final disposition of trial.  Publication in law report or law digest permitted.    REASONS  [1] On 6 May 2020 this Court dismissed Mr Harrison’s applications for leave to appeal against decisions of the Court of Appeal and the District Court.1 The Court did  Harrison v R [2020] NZSC 43 (Glazebrook, O’Regan and Williams JJ).  See also Harrison v R [2019] NZCA 534 (Collins J); and R v Harrison [2019] NZDC 9601 (Judge Gilbert).  PETER DANIEL HARRISON v R [2020] NZSC 59 [23 June 2020]  not consider it needed an oral hearing. Nor did it consider it necessary to appoint counsel to represent Mr Harrison.  [2] On 21 May 2020 this Court received a request from Mr Harrison for a rehearing of the matter. A further request was received from Mr Harrison on 4 June 2020, with an explanation that, at the time of the decision, Mr Harrison was in France, a country heavily-hit by Covid-19, where he was unable to contact anyone by email. He requests an oral hearing and again asks us to appoint counsel.  [3] We treat Mr Harrison’s email requests post-judgment as an application to recall our judgment of 6 May 2020.  [4] The general rule is that a judgment, once delivered, must stand for better or worse.2 There are, however, three categories of cases where a judgment may be recalled: a legislative amendment or a new development in case law of “high authority”; a failure by counsel to draw attention to a relevant statutory provision or caselaw; or “where for some other very special reason justice requires that the judgment be recalled”.3  [5] None of these grounds is made out. The application for recall of our judgment of 6 May 2020 is therefore dismissed.  [6] For fair trial reasons, we make an order prohibiting publication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in news media or on the internet or other publicly available database until final disposition of trial.  Publication in law report or law digest permitted.  2 Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2) [1968] NZLR 632 (SC) at 633; see as cited in Craig v Williams [2019] NZSC 60 at [10].  3 Saxmere Company Ltd v Wool Board Disestablishment Company Ltd (No 2) [2009] NZSC 122, [2010] 1 NZLR 76 at [2]; Green Growth No 2 Ltd v Queen Elizabeth the Second National Trust [2018] NZSC 115 at [20]; and Craig v Williams, above n 2, at [10].

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANANUI SC 41/2020 [2020] NZSC 55  BETWEEN MICHAEL MAIN Applicant  AND NEW ZEALAND POLICE Respondent  Court: Glazebrook, O’Regan and Ellen France JJ Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment: 12 June 2020  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.   REASONS  [1] Mr Main filed a document with the Registry headed “Statement of Claim Ex Parte Quash all Infringement Notices numbers, PR3744073, &, PR3743518, Dated, 21/3/2020 As of Right”. The infringement notices to which the document referred were both issued for driving a vehicle at a speed exceeding the speed limit. The document seeks the quashing of the infringement notices.   [2] When the document was filed, the Registrar advised Mr Main that this Court only has jurisdiction to consider applications for leave to appeal against decisions of lower courts.  There was therefore no jurisdiction to consider Mr Main’s document.  Unsatisfied with that reply, Mr Main applied for “review” of the Registrar’s decision.  MICHAEL MAIN v NEW ZEALAND POLICE [2020] NZSC 55 [12 June 2020]  [3] In accordance with the procedure outlined by this Court in Slavich v R, the Registrar referred the document filed by Mr Main to a panel of leave judges.1  [4] We treat the document filed by Mr Main as an application for leave to appeal against the infringement notices issued.  As we pointed out in an earlier decision relating to Mr Main, the jurisdiction of this Court in criminal proceedings is governed by s 71 of the Senior Courts Act 2016.2 Section 71(a) provides that, in relation to criminal proceedings, this Court’s jurisdiction is to determine applications for leave to appeal and appeals authorised by Part 6 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011.  In the present case there is no lower Court decision against which an application for leave to appeal can be initiated.  Mr Main’s document therefore asks the Court to do something that it does not have jurisdiction to do.   [5] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed because the Court does not have jurisdiction to consider it.  1 Slavich v R [2015] NZSC 195, (2015) 23 PRNZ 117 at [9]. 2 Main v New Zealand Police [2019] NZSC 2 at [4].

Registrar/Deputy Registrar     STEPHEN HEWLETT  Date ... lf...J.~  Deputy Registrar Hiqh Court nf New Zealand  Solicitors: Public Trust, Christchurch  PUBLIC TRUST as Administrator ofthe estate of Sally Tera Baker v PUBLIC TRUST [2020] NZHC 1294 [11 June 2020]  [1] Sally Tera Baker of Mamaku owned a property at 9 Arahiwi Road, Mamaku. In February 2019 the Rotorua District Council completed a rating sale ofthe prope1iy. Ms Baker had died intestate much earlier on 11 May 1982. On 11 February 2020 Public Trust filed an Election to Administer the deceased's estate.  [2] After payment of the outstanding rates to. the Rotorua District Comi and incidental costs associated with the rating sale a sum of$45,164, 15 was deposited with the Registrar ofthe High Comi at Rotorua. The Registrar advises that the net proceeds of sale were then transferred to Public Trust in accordance with s 76(1), Local Government (Rating) Act 2002 (the Act).  [3] Public Trust in its capacity as Administrator of the estate of Sally Tera Baker, seeks an order under s 76(2) ofthe Act for the payment ofthe balance held by Public Trust, together with interest, under the Statutory Trust to it as Administrator of the estate.  [4] Whiles 76(2) of the Act is silent as to whom the net proceeds of sale should be paid to, this Court has accepted on two occasions that the former registered proprietors are the prima facie staiiing point for consideration of the issue. 1  [5] Such an order is appropriate in this case.· Accordingly there will be an order pursuant to s 76(2) of the Act that Public Trust pay the balance proceeds it holds (including accrued interest) on account of the sale of 9 Arahiwi Road, Mamaku (CT SAl7B/841, South Auckland Registry) to Public Trust in its capacity as administrator of the estate of Sally Tera Baker.

BETWEEN KATE CULLUM Applicant   AND  JOANNA GORDON Respondent   Hearing:  9 June 2020    Appearances: No appearance by or on behalf of the Applicant No appearance by or on behalf of the Respondent (papers not released for service)  Judgment: 9 June 2020   JUDGMENT OF POWELL J  This judgment was delivered by me on 9 June 2020 at 3.30 pm pursuant to R 11.5 of the High Court Rules  Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date:  CULLUM v GORDON [2020] NZHC 1261 [9 June 2020]  [1] In my Minute of 2 June 2020 I noted that the application for leave to appeal filed by Ms Cullum appeared to be an abuse of the process of this Court and directed that the application was to be called in the Appeals list this morning. I confirmed that Ms Cullum would have the opportunity to explain to me why her application for leave to appeal should be allowed to proceed or whether it should be struck out, noting that in the event Ms Cullum did not attend Court the application was likely to be dismissed. In the meantime I directed the Registry not to release the service papers pending further order of the Court.  [2] Since the Minute was issued Ms Cullum has provided further emails to the Court, the latest one containing a 40-page submission dated 8 September 2020, but has confirmed that she will not be attending Court in support of her application.  [3] Having read the various documents filed by Ms Cullum including the submission, it confirms my initial view that the application is an abuse of the process of this Court.  The language used throughout all of the documents filed by Ms Cullum, including the application for leave and the proposed notice of appeal, is in fact wildly inappropriate, consisting of sustained and gratuitous personal attacks on the respondent and a variety of other individuals, including the Tenancy Tribunal adjudicator and the District Court Judge whose decision Ms Cullum seeks to appeal. Throughout these attacks, which are couched in extreme religious language, there is not the slightest suggestion of a bona fide issue that may call into question the judgment sought to be appealed. In those circumstances I have no hesitation in exercising my inherent jurisdiction and dismissing the application for leave to appeal as a manifest abuse of the process of this Court.  [4] The application for leave to appeal is hereby dismissed.  Powell J

[2] The application sought to have certain property vested in the liquidator. The property included a certificate of title which was described as WN31B/359.  [3] By a reserved decision dated 1 November 2019, the Court granted the orders sought.  [4] By application dated 4 March 2020 (drawn to my attention on 8 June 2020), the plaintiffs advise that the reference toCertificate of Title WN31B/359 was an error and that the relevant Certificate of Title should be WN58B/100. Theplaintiffs apply under the slip rule of the High Court Rules 2016 (HCR 11.10) for the judgment to be amended and reissued on the basis that correction of the error will give effect to what was decided and intended by the Court.  [5] Inrelianceondecisions such as Willcocks v Teat1 and Nash v Nash2 ,Iconclude that it is appropriate to use HCR11.10 to correct an error of counsel in this manner.  [6] Accordingly, pursuant to that rule, the judgment in this matter dated 1November 2019 is reissued with the Certificate of Title recorded as WN31B/359 at [19](c)(i) being deleted and replaced with the reference to Certificate of Title WN58B/100.

[3] The application by the first plaintiff and the defendants to set aside the summary judgment is granted.

Arepresentative of the companyhad testifiedas to its falsity. The appeal notice recorded that fresh evidence was available to show that the document was not forged.   [2] Afixturewas allocated for 30 November but vacated at theappellant’s request while the legal aid situation was clarified. Mr Murray had appeared for Ms King at trial, and was still acting. However, on 15 April Mr Murray filed an application to withdraw. The application noted that since early December, despite several attempts on his part, he had been unable to contact Ms King and had no instructions. He was not in a position to advance either the legal aid situation or the appeal.  Section257(1)(b)Crimes Act 1061. Ministry of Social Development v King [2019]NZDC10696.

At the same time I directed the Registrar to advise Ms King that:  (a)  Mr Murray had been granted leave to withdraw;   (b)  she was required to contact the Registry concerning the appeal;   (c)  if no contact was made the matter would bereferred to a Judge; and   (d)  itwas possible that Judgemaydismissthe appeal without furtherefforts being made to contact Ms King.    No response has been received.  [4] I have reviewed the file. The appeal was premised on fresh evidence which has not bee provided.  I cannot see any irregularity in the process, and no miscarriage is apparent to me on the face of the judgment. In these circumstances I consider it is appropriate to dismiss the appeal, and I order accordingly.  Simon France J  Solicitors: Crown Solicitor, Palmerston Northfor Crown

REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given by Brown J)  [1] The applicant’s application for leave to appeal to this Court from the interlocutory decision declining his request for an exemption from the requirement to pay security for costs in the High Court was dismissed on 24 April 2020.  [2] The respondent who is legally aided now seeks costs. The costs sought are calculated on a band A category 3 basis, namely utilising a daily recovery rate of $3,530.  BCB v CSB [2020] NZCA165[18 May2020]  [3] The applicant opposes an award of costs.  His grounds of opposition include:  (a)  heintends to fileafurtherapplication forleaveto appeal to the Supreme Court;   (b)  his appeal raised a seriouslyarguablequestion of law of public interest and importance;   (c)  he is an impecunious self-represented litigant; and   (d)  the respondent is legally aided.    [4] Wedo notconsider that thereisanyreason why, inaccordancewith the general principle in r 53A(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005, that costs should not follow the event.   [5] However we do not consider that there is any justification for costs being calculated other than on the basis of a standard application for leave.

Solicitors: CrownLawOffice,Wellington Copyfor: Applicant  NOTTINGHAM vARDERN [2020] NZHC 1013[15 May2020]  [1] Mr Nottingham has applied for recall of my judgment of 23 April 2020, in which I declined his application for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to the Habeas Corpus Act 2001 (“Act”).1 The respondents oppose the application for recall.  [2] The gist of Mr Nottingham’s application is that Crown counsel misled me at the hearingof his application on 17 April2020. In particular,Mr Nottingham contends Crown counsel misled me in the course of their submissions as to the legality or otherwise of the (now revoked) order of the Director-General of Health issued on 3April 2020 (“order”). Crown counsel deny misleading me in any way whatsoever.  [3] Although Mr Nottingham sought ahearingon hisapplication, Iam satisfied I can deal with it on the papers.  [4] Mr Nottingham and Crown counsel madedetailed submissions forand against the application for recall. However, the critical point is that my judgment has been subject to a concluded appeal, that is the Court of Appeal has both heard and determined Mr Nottingham’s appeal against my judgment.2 The effect of this is to preclude recall ofmy judgment. 3  [5] Quite aside from that, and even if Mr Nottingham could persuade me I was misled as he contends, I would have declined to exercise my discretion to recall the judgement because itwould bepointless to do. Thematters onwhich Mr Nottingham seeks to relydo not bear on the determinative issue of whether the effect of the order was to “detain” him within the meaning of theAct.  Thus the outcome post anyrecall would remain the same.   Result  [6] I dismiss the application for recall accordingly.  Peters J  1 A v Ardern [2020]NZHC796.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND I TE KOTI PIRA O AOTEAROA  CA12/2019 [2020] NZCA 118   BETWEEN SADIQ MOHAMED FARAH Appellant  AND THE QUEEN Respondent   Court: Kós P, Brown and Clifford JJ  Counsel: Appellant in Person STLTeppett for Respondent  Judgment: 24 April 2020 at 3.30 pm (On the papers)    JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  The appeal is dismissed.  REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byClifford J)  [1] Mr Farah was convicted of indecent assault following a jury trial in the District Court at Auckland in August 2018. Hefiled an appeal against conviction on 22January 2019.  [2] The appeal has since been beset by numerous delays. Timetabling directions given byMillerJon6March 2019 werenotcomplied with. On23May2019, MrDuff  — then Mr Farah’s counsel — was granted leave to withdraw after he advised theCourt that hecould not contactMr Farah. On 6 August 2019, the matterwas called  FARAH vR [2020] NZCA118[24April 2020]  before a Divisional Court but the hearing was adjourned when Mr Farah did not appear.  [3] Followingthat hearing, by minute of 8 August 2019, Mr Farah was directed to filesubmissions no later than 22 August 2019and warnedhis appeal wouldotherwise be dismissed under s 338 of the Criminal ProcedureAct 2011.  [4] On 21 August 2019, Mr Farah filed an affidavitsuggestingthat correspondence had been sent to the wrong address and requesting more time to secure new representation. Mr Farah was consequently granted more time and directed to apply for agrant of legal aid and to advise the Court when he had done so.  [5] In the following months, Mr Farah was telephoned by Registry several times and reminded of the need to apply for legal aid. An application form was posted to him for that purpose. However, no application was filed and Mr Farah is, once more, unable to be contacted.  [6] On 2 March 2020, Mr Farah was warned by minute that his appeal would be dismissed under s 338 if he did not apply for legal aid (or advise that he intended to represent himself). He was given until 16 March 2020 to make the necessary application.  [7] There has been neither an application by Mr Farah nor any contact from him.  [8] We note, for the avoidance of doubt, that this final deadline was missed by MrFarah before the country entered restrictive COVID-19 alert levels (and in fact preceded the announcement of the alert level system on 21 March 2020). Practical difficulties subsequently caused by these measures therefore do not provide an explanation for his failure to prosecute the appeal.   Result  [9] The appeal is dismissed.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANANUI SC 20/2020 [2020] NZSC 32  BETWEEN ASHOR CHRISTIAN GORGUS Applicant AND THE QUEEN Respondent Court: Glazebrook, O’Regan and Williams JJ Counsel: Applicant in person J M Irwin for Respondent Judgment: 9 April 2020  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.   REASONS  [1] In November 2018 the applicant was arrested and charged with burglary. A backpack he had been carrying was found to contain items belonging to the address that had been burgled. The applicant elected trial by jury and challenged the admissibility of evidence obtained from the backpack.  [2] In a pre-trial ruling, Chief Judge Taumaunu in the District Court held that the evidence was admissible.1 The applicant applied for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against that ruling.2  [3] Before the appeal was heard, the applicant entered a plea of guilty to an amended charge of receiving.  He was sentenced on that charge to 18 months’  1 R v Gorgus [2019] NZDC 24941. 2 Under s 217 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011.  ASHOR CHRISTIAN GORGUS v R [2020] NZSC 32 [9 April 2020]  imprisonment.3 Nevertheless, the applicant continued to pursue his application for leave to appeal against the pre-trial admissibility ruling.  [4] The Court of Appeal declined leave, considering it no longer had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal because the applicant’s guilty plea meant the admissibility issue was moot.  The Court noted that the applicant had two options to contest liability: vacate his guilty plea or lodge an appeal against conviction.  Both would require him to provide evidence explaining why he entered his guilty plea.4  [5] The applicant seeks leave to appeal that decision to this Court.  [6] This Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain an application for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal’s refusal of leave.5 Nor would it help the applicant to treat this as an application for leave to appeal directly from the District Court ruling, as there are no exceptional circumstances as required by s 75(b) of the Senior Courts Act 2016.6 Further, as the respondent submits, there can be no possibility of a miscarriage of justice7 in relation to the question of admissibility where the applicant has accepted responsibility for the offending and his plea has not been vacated.  [7] It is understood that an appeal against conviction has now been lodged in the Court of Appeal. Any matters in relation to the plea itself may be ventilated there.  [8] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  Solicitors: Crown Law Office, Wellington for Respondent  3 R v Gorgus [2019] NZDC 26079 at [15].

REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given by Goddard J)  [1] W was convicted of perjury at a judge-alone trial in the District Court.1 Theconviction related toan affidavit sheswore in Family Court proceedings.

In particular, there may have been a miscarriage of justice as a result of:  (a)  the admission in the District Court perjury proceedings of answers W gave in evidence in the Family Court proceedings in the course of questioningbythe Judge and cross-examination,withoutthe benefit of a caution from the Family Court Judge in relation to the privilege against self-incrimination;   (b)  the District Court Judge’s decisions delivered on the morning of the trial declining to recuse himself, and refusing leave forW’s counsel to withdraw.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUAOAOTEAROA   TAMAKI MAKAURAU ROHE   CIV-2018-404-355   [2020] NZHC 540   UNDER  the Care of Children Act 2004   IN THE MATTER  of an appeal from a decision of the Family   Court at Auckland   BETWEEN  AVINASH SINGH   Appellant   AND  JYOTI DEVI   Respondent   On the papers:   Judgment:  17 March 2020    JUDGMENT OF HINTON J [Re: Costs]  This judgment was delivered by me on 17 March 2020 at 4:00 pm pursuant to Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules  …………………………………………………………………… Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Counsel/Solicitors:  Victorian Lawyers, Papakura  Party:  A Singh  SINGH v DEVI [2020] NZHC 540 [17 March 2020]  [1] By Minute dated 27 June 2018 I recorded that, pursuant to s 143 of the Care of Children Act 2004, this appeal against a decision of the Family Court was to be treated as abandoned by the appellant following his failure to pay security for costs.  I also noted that the appellant had failed to file and serve his submissions, a chronology and the common bundle as directed.  I reserved the question of costs.  [2] The respondent has applied for costs on a 2B basis of $8,028 and also seeks an uplift of 50 per cent from scale on the basis the appellant acted vexatiously, frivolously, improperly and unnecessarily in commencing and continuing the appeal.1 Counsel submits the appeal was meritless and abusive, intended only to vex the respondent.  [3] Turning to the primary question of scale costs, I note that no notice of opposition was filed.  The appeal was disposed of in the manner noted above before that step was required to be taken. Accordingly, I do not award costs in respect of my work that may have been done towards providing that notice.  I do award costs on a 2B basis in respect of counsel for the respondent’s preparing for, filing a memorandum in advance of, and appearing at the first case management conference.  [4] Mr Purusram’s claim for two days for the preparation of costs submissions is improper.  His submissions were only three pages in length, relied largely on the recitation of matters noted in my Minute and (largely irrelevant) provisions of the High Court Rules, and made bare assertions as to the respondent’s entitlement to costs. I make no award of costs in respect of that memorandum.   [5] A situation such as this which has ended speedily and not taken up much time does not justify increased costs.    [6] The appellant is to pay the respondent’s costs in the amount of $2,453 in respect of the steps identified above. I would not in any event expect reasonable actual costs to much exceed that sum.

IN THE HIGH COURT OFNEWZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TE WHANGANUI-A-TARAROHE   CIV-2020-485-142 [2020] NZHC 529   INTHE ESTATE OF MAXWELLBRUCE STUART  On papers Judgment: 17 March 2020     JUDGMENT OFDOBSON J  [1] The originating application without notice for an order declaring a document to be a valid will under s 14 of the Wills Act 2007 has been referred to me.   [2] Some two days before his death, Maxwell Bruce Stuart (the deceased) completed in handwritingin blue biro asingle sheet headed “MyWill”. Theheading was followed by a list of five Christian names against which percentages were recorded in figures.  Underneath that was written “Lynda Share if she shall die before me then goes to her Husband PeterAndrew Srhoj”. Thewritingis then accompanied by a relatively legible signature of the deceased and his full name and the date, 12September 2019 (theSeptember 2019 document).  [3] On 17 July2017,the deceased had completed awillwith the PublicTrust. That will appointed the PublicTrust to be the executor and trustee of the will and provided for specific gifts of personal effects and household goods, including any motor vehicles. Thewillthen provided forgifts of the residue in defined percentages to the same fiverelationsof the deceased as arenominated in the September 2019document.  IN RE ESTATE M B STUART[2020] NZHC 529[17 March 2020]  [4] ThePublic Trust has now brought this application seeking an order validating the September 2019 document as the last will of the deceased. The application is accompanied by consents completed by each of the five beneficiaries named in both the July 2017 will and the September 2019 document, albeit in different percentages.   [5] The September 2019 document does not qualify as a will under the Wills Act because it is not witnessed.  [6] I am satisfied that the September 2019 document should be validated as expressing the deceased’s testamentary wishes.   [7] However, it is incomplete to the extent that it does not appoint an executor or trustee of the will and does not make provision for distribution of personal effects.   [8] I consider the appropriate course is to validate the September 2019 document as a codicil to the July 2017 will, to be read so that the altered percentages for distributions to the five residuary beneficiaries are to apply as provided for in the September 2019 document.   [9] The definition of “will” in s 8 of the Wills Act is clearly broad enough to include a document that the author of it intends to operate as a codicil, rather than as a fresh will. In reliance on the breadth of that definition and the terms of s 14 of the Wills Act, the originating application is granted to give testamentary effect to it.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI PIRA O AOTEAROA CA534/2019 [2020] NZCA 56  BETWEEN PETER D’ARCYLORIGAN Applicant  AND INFINITYAUTOMOTIVE LIMITED Respondent  Court: Miller and Wild JJ  Counsel: Applicant in person R LTowner forRespondent  Judgment: 13 March 2020 at 3.00 pm (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  A Time for the filing of the application for leave to appeal is extended to 14 October 2019.   B No order as to costs.  REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byWild J)  [1] Under r16Aof the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005, Mr Lorigan seeks an extension of time to apply to this Court under s 214 of theEmployment RelationsAct 2000 for leave to appeal.  LORIGAN vINFINITYAUTOMOTIVE LIMITED [2020] NZCA56[13March 2020]  [2] He wishes to appeal a judgment delivered in the Employment Court by Judge Corkill on 5 September 2019.1 That judgment stayed two of Mr Lorigan’s proceedings against Infinity in the Employment Court until Mr Lorigan paid Infinity past costs awards against him totalling $14,995, and ordered Mr Lorigan to pay a further $500 costson the application.  [3] Mr Lorigan, who is representinghimself, filed his leave application in time on 27 September 2019 but this Court’s registryrejected and returned the application as it was not accompanied by the required filing fee, nor was there an application to waive that fee. Mr Lorigan sought a fee waiver on 11 October 2019 and this was granted, and the leave application accepted for filing, on 14 October 2019. Unfortunately, the application was by then out of time.  [4] Given that chronology, the Court would normally extend time. But Infinity opposes an extension on the ground that the leave application is bound to failbecause it does not meet the criteria set out in s 214(3) of the Employment Relations Act.   [5] Given the extensive background to the employment dispute between theparties, Infinity’s assessment may becorrect. But weconsider Mr Lorigan is at least entitled to have his leave application heard and considered on its merits. Theinterests of justice dictate that.  [6] Accordingly, we extend time for the filing of the leave application to 14October 2019and direct that the application is to bescheduled forhearing. We make no order as to costs.

B  The balance of the security is to be paid to the Official Assignee.     REASONS  [1] Mr Ensom is a bankrupt whose appeal to this Court has been abandoned, leaving the Registrar holding $6,600 that he paid as security for costs.  [2] Costspayable accordingto scale areminimal, sincethe respondent did no more than fileanoticeofappearance. It asks however forcostson an indemnitybasis(for solicitor-client costs), citing a deed of guarantee. The amount payable on that basis  MARK ROBERTENSOM v DOWNTOWN HOUSE (No. 2)LIMITED [2020] NZCA51 [12March 2020]  would be$1,583. It goesfurtherandasks thatthe balanceof thesecuritybepaid to it in partial satisfaction of a judgment debt.  [3] I accept that the Court has discretionary jurisdiction to award costs on an indemnity basis where a contract so provides,1 and further to order that costs be deducted from security held.2  [4] It is exceedingly unlikely, however, that the Court would do so in circumstances where the payment would amount to a preference for the judgment creditor. That is plainly the case here, at least in relation to any amount exceeding $1,583.  [5] So far as the actual solicitor-client costs of the appeal are concerned, I do not consider the sum claimed reasonable for a notice of appearance.  [6] The Court ofAppeal (Civil) Rules 2005 do not fix a sum payable for this step.  By analogy with the High Court Rules 2016, 0.2 days is appropriate. Under this Court’s rules for a standard appeal, that comes to $478.  [7] TheRegistrar is to pay$478 to the respondent. TheRegistrar is to advise the OfficialAssigneethat sheis holdingthe balanceand is to payitto the Official Assignee on request.

REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byLang J)  [1] Mr Gorgusfaced achargeof theft in the District Court. Heelected trial byjury and lodged a pre-trial application challenging the admissibility of aspects of the evidence the Crown proposed to adduce at trial.  GORGUS v R [2020] NZCA46[10March 2020]  [2] In apre-trial rulingdelivered on 12 December2019, JudgeTaumaunu heldthe evidencewasadmissible.1 Mr Gorgus then lodgedan appeal againstthat rulingunder s 217 of the Criminal ProcedureAct 2011 (theAct).  [3] On 23 December 2019, Mr Gorgus entered aguiltypleato the charge. Counsel advise us that hewas sentenced on the same date. Notwithstandingthat fact, heseeks to maintain his appeal against the Judge’s pre-trial ruling.   Jurisdiction  [4] As we endeavoured to explain to Mr Gorgus during the hearing, there is no longer any jurisdiction for this Court to consider his appeal.   [5] Whereadefendant has elected trial byjury, s 217(2)(b) of theAct permitsboth the defendant and the Crown to seek leave to appeal pre-trial rulings as to the admissibilityof evidence. OnceMr Gorgus entered his guiltyplea and was convicted, however, the pre-trial phase ended. The admissibility issue he had raised ceased to have any relevance at that point because he acknowledged his guilt through his plea. Thereafteronlytwo options wereopento himto contest his liabilityunderthe charge. Thefirst was bywayof application to the District Court to vacate his guiltyplea. The second was by wayof appeal against conviction to this Court under s 229 of the Act.  Under either route, however, Mr Gorgus would need to provide evidence explaining why he entered his guilty plea.  [6] Wearethereforesatisfiedthis Courthas no jurisdiction to consider the present application.  It is accordingly declined.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date …………….  Solicitors: Neilsons Lawyers,Auckland K3 Legal Ltd,Auckland.  TURNER vIKEDA[2020] NZHC 435[9March 2020]  [1] On 13 February 2020, I delivered a judgment in which I dismissed an appeal by the appellant, Ms Turner, against the dismissal of her claim under the Harassment Act 1997.1 I am now required to fix costs in relation to the appeal.  [2] Therespondent was plainly the successful party and is entitled to an award of costs. I do not consider the appellant succeeded to any material degree in the appeal and no reduction in costs is justified.  [3] The respondent, Mr Ikeda, has now provided evidence that he incurred and paid legal costs amounting to $10,923.97. On that basis counsel for the respondent accepts an award of costs on a category 2B basis is appropriate.  He seeks an uplift of 20 per cent, however, to reflect the fact that the appellant failed to comply with the timetable directions made by consent in relation to the filing and service of submissions. He says this contributed unnecessarily to the time and expense of the proceeding.  [4] The appellant’s submissions were clearly filed late, and I accept this would have placed counsel for the respondent under considerable time pressure to prepare submissions in response. Ido not consider, however, that this is likely to have added materially, if at all, to the overall cost of the proceeding. I therefore do not consider any uplift is justified.  [5] I make an award of costs in favour of the respondent on a category 2B basis together with disbursements as fixed by the Registrar.   [6] TheRegistrar may now disbursethe funds held by wayof security for costs to counsel for the respondent.  Lang J  Turner v Ikeda [2020] NZHC 149.  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANANUI SC UR 18/2019 [2020] NZSC 17  BETWEEN BENJAMIN MORLAND EASTON Applicant AND ATTORNEY-GENERAL Respondent Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment: 6 March 2020  JUDGMENT OF GLAZEBROOK J  The application for review of the Deputy-Registrar’s decision declining to waive the payment of the filing fee is dismissed.   REASONS  Background  [1] On 22 November 2019, Mr Easton filed an application for leave to appeal against a judgment of the High Court striking out his proceedings for judicial review.1 He also filed an application for waiver of the filing fee.  [2] On 26 November the application for a fee waiver was declined by the Deputy-Registrar.  She determined that the proposed appeal did not concern a question of law of significant interest to the public or to a significant section of the public. Therefore, the criterion in reg 5(4)(a) of the Supreme Court Fees Regulations 2003 was not met.  She also considered that the criteria in reg 5(4)(b) were not met as the  Easton v Attorney General (Crown) [2019] NZHC 2910 (Doogue J).  BENJAMIN MORLAND EASTON v ATTORNEY-GENERAL [2020] NZSC 17 [6 March 2020]  appeal was not in respect of a judgment issued in a proceeding commenced by an organisation of the type described in reg 5(4)(b)(ii).   [3] In general, the Deputy-Registrar considered that Doogue J’s decision raised issues specific to the parties only and that it applied well-established principles relating to strike-out applications.    [4] Mr Easton applied for a review of the Deputy-Registrar’s decision on 23 December 2019.     My assessment  [5] I have reviewed the statement of claim, Doogue J’s decision and Mr Easton’s submissions in support of his application for review.    [6] While the issues raised may be of importance to Mr Easton, I agree with the Deputy-Registrar that the criteria for a fee waiver are not met.  [7] I note in any event that, on the material currently before the Court, it is not apparent that the criterion in s 75(b) of the Senior Courts Act 2016 is met. That section provides that there must be exceptional circumstances to justify a direct appeal from the High Court to this Court.     Result  [8] The application for review of the Deputy-Registrar’s decision declining to waive the payment of the filing fee is dismissed.

B The approvedquestionis whether theCourtofAppeal was correct to reject the applicant’s claims of legal advice privilege and litigation privilege respectively.  C In all other respects, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] We do not consider the criteria for the grant of leave to appeal are met in  relation to the orders to disclose financial statements and minutes of meetings (subject  LAMBIE TRUSTEE LIMITED v PRUDENCE ANNE ADDLEMAN [2020] NZSC14 [4 March 2020]  to any necessary redactions).1 The Court of Appeal’s decision in relation to those documents was an application of this Court’s recent decision in Erceg v Erceg and there is no reason for us to revisit that decision.2 Nor do we see any appearance of miscarriage in relation to those aspects of the Court ofAppeal’s decision.  [2] We ask counsel for the applicant to include in her submissions to the Court such general information about the nature of the legal opinions and other advice as possible, so that the Court has a proper context in which to consider the privilege issues.

The parties are to file submissions in accordance with paragraphs [5]–[6] of this judgment.  REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byWilliams J)  [1] In the judgment of this Court of 13 December 2019, we made a costs order against the respondent in terms of cl 4.1 of the settlement deed.1 The appellant duly provided a schedule of costs which totalled the rather impressive sum of $371,436.71  Ngati Tama Custodian Trustee Ltd v Phillips [2019] NZCA647.  NGATI TAMACUSTODIAN TRUSTEE LIMITED vPHILLIPS[2020] NZCA34[2March 2020]  (including GST). The respondent filed a memorandum on 29 January 2020 seeking two things:  (a)  documentation substantiating the costs quantum; and   (b)  to remind the court that in fact the respondent was legally aided in the appeal.    [2] This last-mentioned fact was not referred to in the judgment.   [3] Section 45(2)of theLegal ServicesAct 2011provides that “[n]o order for costs maybemadeagainstan aided person inacivil proceedingunlessthe court is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances”. “Exceptional circumstances” are further particularised in the inclusive list contained in subs (3).  [4] Plainly, an order for an award of costs is not to be made without the enquiry required by section 45.  [5] Wethereforerecallthis Court’s costsaward madein the substantivejudgment.2 We seek submissions from the parties as to whether, and if so to what extent, any exceptional circumstances justify an award of costs in this case. It is unnecessary to further address the question of substantiating documentation at this stage.  [6] The appellant may file any submissions within 10 working days of this judgment.  Therespondent may respond within 10 further working days.

[2] Mr Ward subsequently applied to theCourt ofAppeal for an extension of time to appeal the costs award against him.2 He also filed an application in this Court, seeking to stay the costs award, pending determination of his proposed appeal.  [3] Byjudgment dated 24 February2020, the Court declined to grant an extension of time to appeal, on the basis that Mr Ward’s appeal lacked merit and faced insurmountable barriers.3  [4] It necessarilyfollows that the stay application filed in this Court isnow moot. It is accordingly dismissed. Mr Lochore is entitled to costs in respect of the stay application on a 2B scale basis.

B  The applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent.    REASONS  Introduction  [1] Mr Lincoln applies for leave to appeal against a decision of the Court of Appeal1 dismissing his appeal against a High Court decision of 23 November 2018, in which Dunningham J held that Mr Lincoln does not satisfy the character requirements to be admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the High Court of New Zealand.2  1 Lincoln v New Zealand Law Society [2019] NZCA 442 (Collins, Wylie and Ellis JJ). 2 Lincoln v New Zealand Law Society [2018] NZHC 3050 (Dunningham J) at [76].  RICHARD LINCOLN v NEW ZEALAND LAW SOCIETY [2020] NZSC 4 [14 February 2020]  [2] Mr Lincoln’s application for leave to appeal to this Court is some two months out of time.  His application for an extension of time is opposed by the respondent.   Our assessment  [3] No adequate excuse has been provided for the late filing of this application for leave to appeal.  [4] In any event, we do not consider the criteria for leave are met.3 The decisions below do not raise any issues of principle. They are based on the particular facts. We do not consider there is any risk of a miscarriage of justice.4 There are concurrent findings in the Courts below and nothing raised by Mr Lincoln suggests that the conclusion reached by those Courts may have been in error.   Result  [5] Mr Lincoln’s application for an extension of time to file his application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  [6] The applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent.

(b)  Reversing the liquidators’ final report dated 5 March 2019 and re­appointing the former liquidators under s 284(1)(b) of the Companies Act 1993.   (c)  Directing that the applicant may continue the current proceeding againstAardvark Concrete Services (2000) Limited (in liquidation) in CIV-2019-485-327 under s 248(1)(c) of the Companies Act 1993.   (d)  Costs.    [2] The basis for the application was set out in an affidavit of Craig Michael McCarthysworn 4 December2019. In essence in proceedings beforethe Court under CIV-2019-485-327 the applicant is proceeding as plaintiff againstAardvark Concrete Services (2000) Limited, the second respondent and a related trust and trustees. The claim is based on certain covenants/warranties in a sale and purchase agreement with the company as vendor of a business. In a statement of defence to an amended statement of claim the second respondent pleads that he has no liability because the companyhasbeenliquidated. Theapplicantdoes notaccept that but says toavoid any argument to the contrarythese applications have been made.  [3] Affidavits of service have been filed with the Court. Ajoint memorandum of counsel has also now been provided indicating the respondents to the present proceeding do not oppose the application being granted. By affidavit dated 3 December 2019 the liquidator, Mr Iain Shephard consented to the originating application.  [4] On that basis I am satisfied that the orders are appropriate as set out in [1] above. The exception is the order referred to in [1](d) as it has been agreed between the parties that no orders forcosts should be made.  Cooke J

I heard evidence about the extent of the damage and I saw photographs. I intend to sentence you on the basis of the evidence that I've heard and on the basis that it took place at a time of considerable stress and fast developing circumstances.  R v POMANA [2020] NZHC 181 [13 February 2020]  [2] Ordinarily an offence of this kind would be one in respect of which I would consider it appropriate to impose a sentence of supervision. 1  [3] But you have already spent an extended time in custody -the maximum sentence under s 11 is imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months and you have spent something in excess of 10 months in custody.2 You have spent substantially longer than that in custody already awaiting trial on the charges that you faced. The Crown has suggested that you should be sentenced to a short sentence of imprisonment, perhaps 2 weeks. But I consider that that would be disproportionately severe for this offence taken on its own, as it must be. In all the circumstances I therefore propose to convict and discharge you.  [4] So, Mr Pomana you are free to go.  ,,­  Goddard J  Solicitors:  K Mills and A Pearce, Meredith Connell, Auckland (Email: Kate.Mills@mc.co.nz); A Ives and J Reid, Barristers, Auckland (Email: aives.barrister@gmail.com);  I asked counsel if I was right to understand that no question of restorative justice arises and that no reparations are sought. Counsel for the Crown advised that is correct in respect of reparation. She had not had the oppmtunity to check in respect of restorative justice but given that the owner ofthe cabin is ultimately a corporate entity she agreed with counsel for the defendant that the issue doesn't arise. I did not consider that a restorative justice process would serve any useful purpose in this case in any event. Counsel for the defendant advised he had spent about 13 months in custody. Counsel for the Crown was not in a position to provide a precise figure but confirmed it was a substantial period, well in excess of 3 months.  
IN THE HIGH COURT OFNEWZEALAND MASTERTON REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA WHAKAORIORI ROHE  CIV-2020-435-1 [2020] NZHC 164  UNDER the TrusteeAct 1956 and Part 19 of the High Court Rules 2016  INTHE MATTER OF the J Land C M McCluskeyFamilyTrust  BETWEEN JOCELYNANNETTE MOORE AND IAN FRANCIS WEDDERBURN Applicants  AND CYNTHIA MARGARET MCCLUSKEY Respondent Hearing: On the papers Counsel: PAMcBride and S PRadcliffe for theApplicants Judgment: 13 February 2020    JUDGMENT OFCOOKE J  [1] By applications dated 5 February the applicants seek orders:  (a)  Permitting these proceedings being commenced by way of originating application, without service or notice to any other person, and to be determined on the papers.   (b)  That title in the share of certain property in Featherston be vested in their joint names, with the respondent being removed from the title.    [2] The applications are supported by a joint affidavit of the applicants sworn 31January 2020 and a memorandum of counsel.  MOORE v MCCLUSKEY[2020] NZHC 164[13February2020]  [3] The orders and directions referred to in paragraph [1](a) above are routinely given in matters of this kind, and are in order here.  [4] Therespondent was until recentlyatrusteeof the trust that owned the property in question. The application is made as a consequence of the respondent’s dementia which is described in a report from Dr Steve Philip of the Martinborough Health Centre and the joint affidavit of the applicants. I note that with applications of this kind it is preferable forthe Court to beprovided with detailed information concerning the incapacitation of a trustee, but in the present case I am satisfied that she is incapacitated for the reasons set out in this evidence.  [5] The particular orders that are sought are under s 52 of the Trustee Act 1956.  Although the respondent has recently been removed and replaced as a trustee under s43 of the TrusteeAct 1956 her name remains on the title. Whilstshe alsohas given enduring power of attorney to one of the applicants, the orthodox view is that this cannot be exercised in respect to a person’s role as a trustee of a trust.1 Accordingly vesting orders are necessary to effect a transfer of the title to the applicants as the existing trustees.  [6] Iaccept that such orders are appropriate.  I accordingly order that:  In respect of the three-quarter share of the property consisting of land in Featherston, contained in the record of title WN15A/260:  (i)  Cynthia Margaret McCluskey is removed from the title of the property identified byWN15A/260.    (ii)  The title of that property is vested in the joint names of Jocelyn Annette Mooreand Ian Francis Wedderburn.

REASONS OFTHE COURT   (Given by Brown J)  [1] Followingajurytrial in the District Court at New Plymouth in February2017, Mr Herlihywasconvicted of contravening aprotection orderbyfollowing a protected person, his ex-wife. His conviction appeal was allowed in December 2018 after it became apparent that the protection order applied onlyto the couple’s two children.1 It appears that all parties had proceeded on the misapprehension that there was aprotection order in place in respect of Mr Herlihy’s ex-wife.

HERLIHYvR [2020] NZCA11[11 February2020]  [2] Mr Herlihy, who represented himself both at trial and on appeal, now seeks costsin connection with his successful appeal. However, aself-represented litigant is not entitled to costs under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967.2  [3] Consequently, we accept Ms Mildenhall’s submission that this Court has no jurisdiction to grant Mr Herlihy’s application for costs on his appeal.3 As a result his application for costs in this Court is declined.

IN THE HIGH COURT OFNEWZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TEWHANGANUI-A-TARAROHE  CIV-2018-485-680 [2020] NZHC 131   UNDER  the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990   BETWEEN  PETER JOHN HARTLEY   Plaintiff    AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFTHE DEPARTMENTOF CORRECTIONS Defendant  Teleconference: 10 February 2020  Appearances: S J Fraser for the Applicant A Powell for the Defendant  Judgment: 11 February 2020    JUDGMENT OFCOOKE J  [1] The plaintiff, Mr Peter Hartley has advanced various claims against the defendant under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The claims are fully described in an amended statement of claim dated 29 April 2019.  [2] The parties have now agreed to resolve the claims by the Court making a declaration. I was initially inclined to simply make the orders the parties had agreed by consent, but the parties have asked that I record the reasons in a short judgment. I accept it is appropriate to do so.   Relevant factual circumstances  [3] The claims concern the actions of the Department of Corrections when transporting Mr Hartley on two occasions while he was a serving inmate. First when  HARTLEYv THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFTHE DEPARTMENTOF CORRECTIONS[2020] NZHC 131 [11 February 2020]  hewastransferred to RimutakaPrison to TongariroPrison on 30 November2016,and secondly when he was transported from Tongariro to Rimutaka Prison on 14 December 2016.  [4] Mr Hartley contended that his treatment on those journeys breached his rights under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, and he sought relief in the form of declarations.   [5] The defendant accepts that Mr Hartley’s treatment on the two occasions specified breached his rights under s 23(5)of the New Zealand Billof Rights Act 1990. That was so because he was placed in a situation where he was forced to urinate on himself and his clothing. In particular, the defendant accepts the plaintiff’s factual ascertain that during a scheduled stop on each of those journeys at Manawatu Prison he was not given the opportunity to use the toilet, nor were any alternative arrangements made for him.   [6] The defendant agrees to the making of the declaration contemplated by the facts set out above, and Mr Hartley agrees with the defendant that a declaratory judgment can be given by consent. The balanceof the claims advanced byMr Hartley will be discontinued by the plaintiff filing a notice of discontinuance.  [7] I agree that in the circumstances referred to the agreed declaration is in order.  Accordingly I grant the following declaration by consent:  That Mr Hartley’s treatment during his transportation by the defendant on 30 November 2016 and 14 December 2016 was in breach of s 23(5) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.  [8] It is also agreed that there be no order as to costs.   Cooke J  Solicitors: John Miller Law, Wellington for Applicant Crown Law, Wellington for Respondents  
IN THE HIGH COURT OFNEWZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TEWHANGANUI-A-TARAROHE  CIV-2019-485-173 [2020] NZHC 97  BETWEEN  HARRY MEMELINK and LYNXTRUSTEES LIMITED as trustees of Link Trust (No.1) Applicants   AND  THE OFFICIALASSIGNEE Respondent    Counsel: H Memelink for himself (by memorandum) D Kerr for respondent (by memorandum)  Judgment: 7 February 2020   COSTS JUDGMENT OFASSOCIATE JUDGE JOHNSTON [On the papers]  [1] In my judgment of 16 October 2019 I dismissed applications by MrHarry Memelink and the trustees of the Link Trust (No. 1) (Mr Memelink and Lynx Trustees Ltd) for orders pursuant to s 239 of the InsolvencyAct 2006 reversing two decisions of the Official Assignee as the assignee of the bankrupt estate of MrMalcolm Grindlay. It is not necessary here to restate the issues in the case or summarise my reasons. These are all evident from the substantive judgment. I will however observethat Ihad littledifficultyin reaching theconclusions that Idid in that judgment. I reserved costs as I had not heard argument on those. I indicated that if costscould not beagreed the parties could filememorandaand Iwould deal with them on the papers.  [2] I now have memoranda on costs from Mr Kerr for the Official Assignee dated 5 December 2019and MrMemelink seeminglyonhis ownbehalf and onbehalf of the  MEMELINK and vTHE OFFICIALASSIGNEE [2020] NZHC 97 [7 February2020]  trustees (of course he has no standing to represent the trustees collectively, but I put that to one side) dated 3 February 2020.  [3] Mr Kerr’s two-page memorandum is straightforward. He says that the applicants were wholly unsuccessful and that, prima facie, the respondent is entitled to a costs award.  On the OfficialAssignee’s behalf he seeks costs on a 2Bbasis.  [4] Mr Memelink did not respond bymemorandum for two months. Hisresponse runs to 87 pages.  In effect itis are-run of allof the arguments advanced in support of theapplication in the firstplace, coupled with an attempt to introduce further evidence in the bodyof the memorandum itself and via various attachments and a great deal of extraneous material.  [5] The position is very clear. The High Court Rules provide that costs are ultimately a matter for the Court’s discretion. However, in the absence of special circumstances, the successful party in litigation is generally entitled to an award of costs, and these are calculated in accordance with the scales provided forin schedules 2and 3. Thoseschedules providea3pointrangefor recoveryratesand a3 pointrange fortime allocation. Thus, the2Bawardas sought bytheOfficialAssigneein this case is the mid-range on both scales, and reflects the orthodox position.  [6] I am not prepared in this costs judgment to re-canvass all of the arguments made on behalf of the applicants in the substantive hearing.  It is sufficient to say that there is nothing in Mr Memelink’s extensive memorandum that comes even remotely close to persuadingmethat the circumstances of this casewould justifydepartingfrom the orthodox position which I have already described. The reality is that on the available evidence theapplications were unsuccessful, and plainlyunmeritorious, and that there is no reason to deprive the successful party — The Official Assignee — of her costs.  [7] I order that the applicants pay to the OfficialAssignee costs on a 2B basis as calculated by Mr Kerr at paragraph 5 of his memorandum of 5 December 2019, that is to say an all inclusive figure of $12,786.50.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar ……………………………………  Solicitors / Parties: Mr P C Creagh, Anderson Creagh Laid Ltd, Auckland The Defendant  EASTLAND OFFICE COFFEE SYSTEMS LTD v NOBILO [2019] NZHC 3307 [13 December 2019]  [1] The plaintiff filed proceedings and sought summary judgment on 16 October 2019 for breach of the defendant’s guarantee of Winespecific Ltd’s obligations to buy back wine from the plaintiff.  [2] The defendant has signed an admission to the plaintiff’s cause of action dated 10 December 2019. The defendant admits liability to the plaintiff, including for interest and costs.  The admission states that the defendant does not wish to be heard on this matter.  [3] Counsel for the plaintiff has filed a memorandum dated 10 December 2019 seeking judgment on admission, including costs on a 2B basis, and disbursements, and requests that the call of the matter be vacated, with counsel’s appearances excused.1  [4] In the case of an admission of cause of action under r 15.16, the plaintiff may seal judgment on the cause of action admitted without Court determination.  [5] The only matter requiring determination is the fixing of costs given the admission did not specify the exact amount.  The plaintiff seeks costs on a 2B basis totalling $9,799 plus disbursements of $1,400.  As the defendant’s admission includes costs and given his indication that he does not wish to be heard, I can fix costs now on the papers.  [6] I consider 2B costs are appropriate in the circumstances.  The plaintiff is entitled to costs as sought, except for item 28 ($717) relating to obtaining judgment without appearance for the reason explained above.  Accordingly, the plaintiff is entitled to 2B costs of $9,082 plus disbursements of $1,400.  [7] Appearances are excused.  Gault J  The return date recorded in the application was 12 December 2019 but there was no summary judgment list on 12 December – they occur on Tuesdays.  The date should have been 17 December.

HENARE O’KEEFE First Appellant   DESMA KEMP RATIMA Second Appellant  FLAXMERE (2008) LIQUOR LIMITED Respondent    JUDGMENT OFDOOGUE J  [1] This judgment is to fix costs followingmyorder strikingout an application by the appellants to adduce further evidence.  [2] It follows my judgments of 31 October and 5 December 2019.  [3] The respondent submits that indemnity costs are appropriate in accordance withr14.6(4)oftheHighCourt Rules 2016 becausetheappellants filed anapplication  O’KEEFE vFLAXMERE (2008)LIQUOR LIMITED [2019] NZHC 3284[12December 2019]  to adduce further evidence when that evidence was never in fact obtained and produced to the Court.  [4] Counsel fortheappellants’submissions in response are ill conceived. It was never reasonable for the appellants to come to this Court making an application to adduce further evidence when that evidence was never obtained from the proposed deponents.  [5] The appellants’ standing (as addressed in their counsel’s submissions at paragraphs 12 to 23) is irrelevant to whether the application should have been made or not. Their standing cannot be germane to a legal decision to make an erroneous application.  [6] It is appropriate forcoststo beawarded in favour of the respondent onan actual basis as sought in the sum of $8,194.15.  [7] Those costs should be paid before any consideration will be given to the application for waiver of security for costs for the substantive hearing and the setting down of the substantive appeal.

REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given by Brown J)  LAND TRUSTLIMITED vWAM PROPERTYLIMITED [2019] NZCA642 [11 December 2019]  [1] In a judgment delivered on 20 November20191 an order was madereinstating the appellants’claim, subject to conditions which included that the appellants were to pay securityfor costs of $35,000 within one week of the date of the judgment and to payafurther amount of securityfor costs in the sum of $35,000 within threeweeks of the date of the judgment.2  [2] The appellants paid the first tranche of security within time. However they claim to beunable to paythe second trancheof $35,000 bytodayandseekanextension of time for payment of that sum to 5.00 pm on Monday 23 December 2019.  [3] Therespondent opposes the extension.  In amemorandum dated 10 December 2019 Mr Wilson submitted that the judgment delivered on 20 November 2019 is final and conclusive and that there is nothing special or exceptional that would justify the exercise of the power to recall or reopen the judgment under r 8A of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005.  [4] While recognising the force of MrWilson’s submission that the appellants are seeking a further indulgence, given the fact that the first payment has been made we consider that it is appropriate to allow the appellants one final opportunity to make payment of the second securityinstalment.  We consider that the power to extend the time is provided byr 5(2)of the Rules, therehavingbeen noappeal from ourjudgment which would render this Court functus officio.  [5] Accordingly we make an order extending the time in order B(ii) of our judgment to 5.00 pm on 23 December 2019.  [6] No furtherextension willbe countenanced. If the second payment is not made by that date the order at [34] of our judgment will take effect.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date.......................................  Solicitors: Newton Law, Auckland P Rice, Auckland  LAD v LAD [2019] NZHC 3239 [10 December 2019]  [1] On 14 October 2019 I issued judgment on the first defendant’s application for orders for security for costs and further particulars of the plaintiff’s claim. I declined to grant the application for security but I ordered (with the plaintiff’s agreement) that the plaintiff provide the further particulars sought.  [2] The issue of costs on the application remains for determination.    [3] Counsel for the first defendant has filed a memorandum as to costs and for the plaintiff, his counsel has filed a memorandum in response.   [4] In my assessment the first defendant is the successful party in an overall sense, but I accept counsel for the defendant’s submission to the extent that I agree that there should be some modest allowance for the success that the first defendant has enjoyed in securing the plaintiff’s agreement to give further particulars. I do not accept the submission that the first defendant is entitled to an indemnity from the Trust at this point for his costs’ liability or the alternative submission that costs should be reserved. I am satisfied the fair course is for the first defendant to pay costs now so that the plaintiff receives some immediate compensation for the costs he has incurred; such an order does not preclude the first defendant from seeking indemnity when the question of overall costs is dealt with, at the end of trial.  Whether or not an indemnity is allowed will be a matter for the trial judge.  [5] There is no dispute that such costs as are awarded should be on a 2B basis.    [6] I make an order for costs and disbursements in favour of the plaintiff on a 2B basis, but with the proviso that there will be a 35% reduction in the overall amount claimed by the plaintiff, pursuant to High Court Rule 14(7)(g).  Along with the reduction, the amount of the award is $3,722.22. It is to be paid within 10 working days.  Associate Judge Sargisson

[2] Mrs Burmester’s application for 2B costs and disbursements calculated at $10,924.50 was filed on 7 November 2019. Assuming it also to have been served on Mr Burmester onthat date, any response he sought to makewas dueby 14 November 2019. The application has been put before me today; no response from Mr Burmester has been received.  [3] I am satisfied the calculation appropriately reflects my original expectation nothing in the steps taken by Mrs Burmester in this averagely complex proceeding required other than a normal amount of time.  [4] I therefore order Mr Burmester to pay Mrs Burmester $10,924.50.  —Jagose J  Burmester v Burmester [2019]NZHC 2766 at [18].

They included twobreaches of a family protection order, an assault on a person in a family relationship, unlawfully getting into a vehicle, dangerous driving, failing to stop, breach of release conditions and resisting arrest.  Mr Burns has an extensive criminal record.  [2] When initially arrested Mr Burns was remanded in custody. Hewas released to attend (successfully) a two-month treatment programme. However, he again breached the protection order not long after completing the programme. The Judge noted the time already spent on custodial remand and concluded the rehabilitative sentence of intensive supervision was appropriate.  [3] Thiswas to includethe wearingof an electronic monitoringdevice. TheJudge considered it would offer protection for the complainant and assist Mr Burns to learn  BURNS v NEWZEALAND POLICE [2019] NZHC 3195[5 December 2019]  to live within the terms of the protection order and other conditions. The Judge was keen to see the cycle of breach and imprisonment broken.1  [4] Thesupervision is for15 months. Mr Burns appeals the monitoring condition, submitting it is too harshgiven the pre-trial remand he had served and the successful treatment course.  [5] Ido not agree. Anexperienced Judgehas fashioned asentencein the hopethat it would effect some change in Mr Burns. The knowledge that his whereabouts can always bedetermined mayprovethe incentivetoseeMr Burns begin to stop breaching the protection order. He and his former partner have children and she recognises contact is inevitable. The supervision conditions allow for this. Mr Burns needs to adjust his behaviour or further breaches are inevitable. The condition is directed at reoffending.  [6] Electronic monitoring is a special condition authorised by s 54I(3)(f) of the Sentencing Act. This is because another of the special conditions prohibitsMr Burns from entering a particular area. In such circumstances, the condition may be reinforced by use of an electronic monitoring condition. Its use is appropriate here. The appeal is dismissed.

He proved a poor attendee and eventually appeared on a charge of breaching community work. Underlying the charge were numerous occasions of non-attendance.  [2] It became clear at sentencing the response to the breach would be a different sentence, namely, community detention. Mr Daly accordingly asked that his remaining hours of community work be converted.  There were 49.75 hours left.  DALYvDEPARTMENTOF CORRECTIONSANDNZ POLICE [2019] NZHC 3162[3 December 2019]  [3] TheDistrict Court left in place the existing sentence of supervision, cancelled the community work sentence and imposed a sentence of six months’ community detention.1  [4] Mr Dalyappeals thelength of thatterm, which is on its facethemaximum term available. The respondent accepts that for a first breach offence, even including the cancelled community work hours, it is open on appeal to conclude it is a manifestly excessive sentence.  [5] I agree. The package does not justify anything approaching the maximum sentence. On the basic offending, aspects of the original sentence had already been completed and it is a first breach.  [6] Counsel were in general agreement as to an appropriate figure. The sentence of six months’community detention is quashed.  In its place I substitute a sentence of sixweeks’community detention. It isto beserved as originallyprovided for –6 pm to 6am; on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights.  [7] In terms of the record, some correction is needed. As matters presently stand the six-month community detention sentence has been attached to allthe sentences. It isunclear tomewhether allthe original sentenceof threemonths communitydetention has been served. It should be. Accordingly:  -onthe original twodrivingoffences,Iquash the communitywork sentence and otherwise leave them as they originally were – nine months’ supervision and three months’ community detention, both sentences concurrent;  -on the breach of community work charge, Iimpose acumulative sentence of six weeks’community detention.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 1/2014   [2014] NZSC 57   BETWEEN  PETER GERARD STOCKMAN   Applicant   AND  NEW ZEALANDASSOCIATION OF   COUNSELLORS INCORPORATED   Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ and William Young J   Counsel:  Applicant in Person   E J Horner for Respondent   Judgment:  14 May 2014    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall of the judgment of 6 May 2014 is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] In a judgment of 6 May 2014,1 the applicant was refused leave to appeal against a judgment of French J in the Court of Appeal declining to dispense with securityfor costsfor an appeal tothe Courtof Appeal. Theapplication for recallis made on the basis that recall is required to avoid an injustice (the third category discussed in Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2)).2  [2] Mr Stockman maintains that the central question for his application for leave to appeal to this Court was whether he was entitled to appeal to the Court for a prospective overruling of the case law that self-represented litigants are not entitled to costs. He says that this Court was in error in regarding his substantive appeal to the Court ofAppeal as a“conventional appeal” seeking actual costs. He argues that  1 Stockman v New Zealand Association of Counsellors Inc [2014] NZSC53. 2 Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2) [1968]NZLR 632 (SC).  STOCKMAN v NEWZEALAND ASSOCIATION OF COUNSELLORS INCORPORATED [2014] NZSC 57 [14May2014]  the Court’s leave decision on security for costs did not engage with the prospectivity of the ruling sought by him on the substantive appeal to the Court of Appeal which, he suggests, made security for costs unnecessary since there was no need for the respondent to appear on the appeal.  [3] Whether a prospective change to settled authority is an available response for the Court of Appeal on the substantive appeal is not a question that could affect the determination that there was no justification under s 13 of the Supreme Court Act 2003 for granting leave to appeal against the refusal to dispense with security for costs. The order for security for costs did not prevent Mr Stockman proceeding with the appeal to the Court of Appeal. He could in that appeal, if he wishes to do so, seek prospective overruling (a course the Court of Appeal might perhaps treat as indicating that the appeal against refusal of costs is moot). But his intention to seek prospective change to authorities under which he was refused costs did not itself remove the power of the Court ofAppeal to order costs against him if it rejected his argument. His appeal, though sought to be characterised by him as one that was not a “conventional appeal,” was an appeal against refusal of costs payable by the respondent and there is no impediment to the requirement of securityfor costs.  [4] Nothing put forward by the applicant raised an issue of public or general importance in the appeal against the judgment of French J. That was the conclusion which led this Court to decline leave to appeal. No proper basis for recall of the judgment of 6 May 2014 declining leave is made out. There is no appearance of miscarriage of justice for the reasons given in it.  Solicitors: Morrison Kent, Wellington for Respondent

B The applicationfor leave to appeal is dismissed.    REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byMiller J)  [1] On 23 April 2018, the Family Court at Auckland made a protection order againstthe present applicant, J,on the application of the respondent. J was not present.  Hewants to havethe application reheard on the ground that hewas never given notice of the hearing.  J (CA357/2019) v S [2019] NZCA591[26 November 2019]  [2] J sought arehearingin the FamilyCourt, claimingthat hehad not been served. JudgedeJongfoundas afact that hehad been served.1 Therewas evidencethat Jhad been avoidingservice, and substituted serviceof the application and noticeof hearing was effected at both a physical and email address that he had given.  [3] Peters J dismissed an appeal, reasoning that service had been effected in accordance with the Family Court’s directions and J’s evidence to the contrary was implausible.2  [4] J now seeks leave to appeal to this Court. He also requires an extension of time, which we grant because there was confusion about the appeal pathway. Hethought that the Senior Courts Act 2016 applied, meaning that leave must first be sought from the High Court.3 In fact there is a specific appeal pathway under theDomesticViolenceAct 1995 and it requires that leave be sought from this Court.4 Section 93 of that Act provides that a party may appeal to this Court against any determination of the High Court on a question of law arising in the appeal, with leave of this Court.  [5] J’s difficultyis that theproposed appeal raises no question of law, let alone one of sufficient importanceto warrant asecond appeal. Hesays that hewas denied natural justiceand experienced delaysand procedural irregularities from the FamilyCourt but the proposed appeal ultimatelycomes down to the proposition that he was not served with notice of the application or the hearing.   [6] The application is dismissed. We observe that it is open to J to apply to theFamily Court to discharge the protection order.  1 [S] v [J] Auckland FAM-2017-044-321, 5 October 2018. 2 J v S [2019] NZHC 892. 3 Section60. 4 Section93.

I have now received that memorandum.  [2] I am now satisfied that the risks of offending while on bail are mitigated sufficiently by the intensive supervision of Mr McFarlane’s programme at the address and the strict conditions of EM bail agreed in the consent memorandum.   [3] I allow the appeal and grant Mr Rewiri EM bail on the conditions set out in the consent memorandum dated 25 November 2019.2 The grant of EM bail is to take effect at a time convenient to the prison authorities on Wednesday 27 November 2019.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI PIRA O AOTEAROA  CA536/2014 [2019] NZCA 577  BETWEEN  PAULANTHONYKING Applicant   AND  NORFOLK NOMINEES LIMITED Respondent    Court: Kós P, Brown and Clifford JJ  Counsel: Applicant in person BAVautier for Respondent  Judgment: 21 November 2019 at 10 am (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  The application for recall is declined.  REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given by Clifford J)  [1] On 16 October 2019, we struck out this appeal for want of prosecution.1 MrKingnow applies for recall of that judgment on the basis that it incorrectly recorded that he was adjudicated bankrupt to Norfolk Nominees Ltd, when therelevant company was in fact Norfolk Financial Management Ltd. MrKing suggests the intituling consequently identified the incorrect respondent.  King v Norfolk Nominees Ltd [2019] NZCA494.  KING vNORFOLK NOMINEES LIMITED [2019] NZCA577[21 November 2019]  [2] This is not the first time thequestion of the correct respondent hasarisen. Inhis  notice of appeal, Mr King originally named Norfolk Financial Management Ltd as  therespondent. In 2015, in ajudgment dismissingMr King’s application forareview  of the Registrar’s decision on security for costs, Stevens J determined that was not  thecorrect respondent, and ordered that Norfolk Nominees Ltd be substituted:2  [2] The notice of appeal listed Norfolk Financial Management Ltd as the respondent. Counsel for the respondent hasfiled a memorandum dated 6November 2014 explaining that Norfolk Financial Management Ltd is not the correct party to the appeal. Its debt has now been satisfied. There is however a costs order of $43,405.53 owing to Norfolk Nominees Ltd. That company (referred to here as Norfolk) was substituted as creditor in the High Court and has since taken over as creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings. Mr King still owes Norfolk this sum for costs. Norfolk is therefore substituted as the correct respondent in this Court.  [3] As the Judge recorded, the confusion as to the correct respondent in this Court  followed an error by theAssociate Judge in the High Court:3  Norfolk Financial Management Ltd was incorrectly listed as the applicant in the decision adjudicating Mr King bankrupt, a judgment released after the decision substitutingNorfolkNominees Ltd as creditor. This was rectified by Associate Judge Matthews in a minute, reissuing the judgment, noting the correct [applicant] in its text.  [4] We are satisfied that our judgment correctly identified Norfolk Nominees Ltd  as the applicant in Mr King’s bankruptcy and the respondent in this appeal. Mr King  suggests that theAssociate Judge lacked the power to correct such slips, a point far  removed from our judgment. In any case, we are satisfied that the Judge had  thenecessary power to correct his misidentification of the applicant creditor.   Ironically, Mr King invites us to exercise a similar power in this application.  [5] The criteria forrecall have not been established.4  [6] The application for recall is declined.

ALABOUR INSPECTOR OFTHE MINISTRYOF BUSINESS, INNOVATIONANDEMPLOYMENT v TOURISM HOLDINGS LIMITED [2019] NZCA569[19 November 2019]  REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byGoddard J)  [1] The application for leave to appeal is granted.  [2] The approved questions of law are:  (a)  What is the meaning of “not a regular part of the employee’s pay” in s8(1)(c)(i) of the Holidays Act 2003 for the purpose of calculating ordinary weekly pay under s 8(2) of the Holidays Act?

[3] These questions focus on the application of s 8 to the facts as found by Judge Smith, and on the basis of the Judge’s finding at [38] of the judgment about when thecommission was payable to the driver as a matter of interpretation of theemployment agreement.

B  The approved ground of appeal is whether the Court of Appeal was correct to allow the appeal against the High Court judgment (Stanley v New Zealand Law Society [2018] NZHC 1154) and to make an order for Mr Stanley’s admission.      REASONS  [1] Anapplication for a stayof the CourtofAppeal judgment1 bythe New Zealand Law Society was refused by the Court of Appeal.2 No appeal was lodged against that decision and no application for a stay was made to this Court.

To avoid incurringfurther legal expenses, KBWinstructed his counsel not to respond.  [3] I expressly based my preliminary view on an apprehension “nothing in the steps taken by [KFW] in this averagely complex proceeding required other than a normal amount of time”. I have no reason to diverge from that view. I am satisfied KFW’s calculation is sound.

Although Mr Tobin’s application nominally is issued againstthe Crown,the correct defendant is thus theChiefExecutiveofthe Department of Corrections.  [3] Mr Tobin asserts his conviction for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm,2 for which he was sentenced by Judge D J Orchard in the Kaikohe District Court on 12 October 2018 to four and a half years’imprisonment, was based on unreliable evidence. He also complains his appeal has been stymied by the police and judiciary. And heperceives hehas “been forced into subjugation and contract with a Crown fiction” as retaliatory measures for his previous actions.  [4] Bethatasitmay,itis for the ChiefExecutivetoestablish Mr Tobin’sdetention is lawful.3 I may not question Mr Tobin’s conviction by the District Court.4 His challenge to the Judge’s underlying determination cannot fairly be determined in  5 I habeas corpus’ summary process. am satisfied Mr Tobin is detained under avalid warrant signed by the Judge.

REASONS  [1] The appellant has sought a review of the Registrar’s decision to decline to waive the schedulingfee of $2,700.00  [2] The Registrar refused the waiver application on the ground that the appellant had indicated itwould proceed with the appeal anyway. On review, the appellant says that that goes onlyto means and does not justifythedecision.  It says that theprimary consideration is the scope of the public interest that the appellant claims to represent, which is nothing less than preservation of the rule of law.  THE KIWI PARTYINCORPORATED vTHE ATTORNEY-GENERAL[2019] NZCA538 [6 November 2019]  [3] I accept that the appellant, which describes itself as a political party, has asserted that the case concerns a matter of genuine public interest. However, that proposition is not self-evidently correct. The fact that the appellant is a political organisation pursuing a political outcome (in this case, the repeal of the Arms (Prohibited Firearms, Magazines, and Parts) Amendment Act 2019) — would not normally justify a fee waiver. To the extent that there is said to be a wider public interest at stake, all that can be said at this stage is that it is bound up with the merits of the appeal, which are contested.  [4] The application for review is declined.  Solicitors: Thomas & Co,Auckland forAppellant Crown Law Office, Wellington for Respondent

The plaintiff has filed submissions in opposition dated 5 November 2019.  [3] There is no dispute as to the claimed costs as calculated in scheduleA of the counsel for the defendant’s memorandum of 30 October 2019.

B The approved question is whether the Court of Appeal was in error in setting aside the declarations made at [86] of the judgment of the High Court (Rangitira Developments Ltd v Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society Ltd [2018] NZHC 146, (2018) 20 ELRNZ 312).  C There is no order as to costs.  REASONS  [1] In a judgment delivered on 20 February 2019, the applicant (Rangitira  Developments Ltd) was granted leave to appeal against the judgment of the Court of  Appeal in Rangitira Developments Ltd v Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of  RANGITIRA DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED v ROYAL FOREST AND BIRD PROTECTION SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND INCORPORATED [2019] NZSC 121 [5 November 2019]  New Zealand Inc.1 The Court of Appeal judgment dealt with the approach to be taken by the Buller District Council (the Council) to Rangitira’s application for an access arrangement with the Council to enable the development of a mine on reserve land administered by the Council.   [2] Before the appeal was heard, information emerged about the status of the reserve.  This information led to the Court re-visiting the decision to grant leave.  And, after hearing from the parties, leave to appeal was revoked on the grounds that: first, the appeal was moot; second, it would be argued on a hypothetical basis; and, finally, the appeal would not resolve matters between the parties.2 Leave was reserved to Rangitira to apply again for leave to appeal if the position changed.  In particular, at  [15] of the judgment revoking leave, the Court identified a number of scenarios concerning the status of reserve which, if they occurred, would mean the appeal was not moot.   [3] One of the scenarios, identified in [15(b)], was that the reserve in question became classified as a local purpose reserve under s 16(1) of the Reserves Act 1977. The reserve has now been classified and Rangitira has applied again for leave on the basis the proposed appeal is no longer moot.3 The respondent accepts the scenario contemplated in [15(b)] of this Court’s earlier judgment has come to pass.  [4] The position is accordingly that the proposed appeal is no longer moot.  The Court has earlier accepted the proposed appeal raises questions of general importance. Leave to appeal is therefore granted.  [5] In the circumstances, costs on this application for leave lie where they fall and we make no order as to costs.

Pursuant to Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules  ……………………………… Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors/Counsel:  ShieffAngland,Auckland LeeSalmonLong,Auckland  TAUA,v TAHI ENTERPRISES LIMITED [2019] NZHC 2861 [5 November 2019]  [1] My 29 August 2019 minute explained the parties reached an interim accommodation, pending the Court of Appeal’s March 2020 hearing of related proceedings between them. Theparties wouldsimilarlyhave accommodated vacation of the fixture before meforan interlocutoryinjunction, but failed toexplain the scope of adjournment sought, with the result the civil list judge maintained the fixture, with that consensual result.  [2] At both parties’ request, I reserved the issue of costs. I regret the delay in responding to the parties’ timely engagement on costs. Their memoranda only were put before me for decision this week.  [3] The defendants now seek 2B costs in the amount of $5,377.50, essentially on the basis their expenses in preparation forand attendance at the hearing were wasted. Expressed in that way(and not as a(presently,unjustified) claim forindemnitycosts)1 , the claim relies entirely on my discretion,2 as the defendants do not claim benefit of any principle for determination of costs,3 and “increased costs” spring from such principled determination.4 Thus the claim is just for the plaintiffs’contribution to the defendants’ expenses. Implicit in the defendants’ claim is any wastage is attributable to the plaintiffs’ failure, here to express to the civil list judge the “cogent” and ‘efficient’reasons for the proposed adjournment. But the request foradjournment was joint; both parties bear responsibility for any shortfall in its expression.  [4] Isee no reason to exercise mydiscretion in favour of adetermination of costs now. Theapplication remains fordetermination; onlyappearancetime maybewasted; and either party ultimately may be successful. Myminute recorded my determination may include costs’further reservation, which is mydecision.  [5] Costs are reserved.  —Jagose J  1 HCR14.6(4). 2 HCR14.1. 3 HCR14.2. 4 HCR14.6(1).

[2] The respondents are the children of the deceased by his first marriage. They are all adult,and all reside in Denmark.  [3] This application is required because after the deceased had made his Will appointing the plaintiff the trustee and executrix of the Will, he and the plaintiff married.  [4] The deceased died leaving his Will of 30 October 2008 as his onlyWill.  SORENSEN v SORENSEN [2019] NZHC 2787[30 October 2019]  [5] On the same daythatthe deceased madetheWill, theplaintiff executed aWill in similar terms.  [6] It is submitted that the Will of the deceased was made in contemplation of marriage and was intended to applywhether or not marriage took place.

Theplaintiffalso seeks an orderdeclaringthatthe trust’scostsbepaid out of the estate.  [8] Mr Gradwell represents the respondents who are three children of the deceased’s first marriage.  They are beneficiaries under theWill.  [9] Counsel filed ajoint memorandum dated 11 October 2019. That memorandum records that the respondents agree to the orders sought by the plaintiff.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANANUI  [201 SC 50/2019 9] NZSC 117   BETWEEN  SYNLAIT MILK LIMApplicant  ITED   AND  NEW ZEALAND INDLIMITED First Respondent  USTRIAL PARK   YE QING Second Respondent    Hearing: 21 October 2019 Court: Winkelmann CJ, Glazebrook and O’Regan JJ Counsel: J G Miles QC and A J Horne for Applicant  A R Galbraith QC and D T Broadmore for Respondents Judgment: 29 October 2019  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A  By consent, an order is made substituting Synlait Milk Ltd for Stonehill Trustee Ltd as applicant subject to the conditions set out in the joint memorandum of counsel dated 6 September 2019.   B  Leave to appeal is granted to Synlait Milk Ltd as applicant (New Zealand Industrial Park Ltd v Stonehill Trustee Ltd [2019] NZCA 147).   C  The approved question is whether the Court of Appeal was correct to reverse the decision of the High Court (Stonehill Trustee Ltd v New Zealand Industrial Park Ltd [2018] NZHC 2938).   D  The application by Synlait Milk Ltd to adduce further evidence will be determined at or after the hearing of the appeal.    SYNLAIT MILK LIMITED v NEW ZEALAND INDUSTRIAL PARK LIMITED [2019] NZSC 117 [29 October 2019]  E Leave is granted for the respondents to file an affidavit or affidavits responding to the evidence that Synlait Milk Ltd seeks to adduce. Such affidavit or affidavits must be filed on or before 15 November 2019.  REASONS  [1] The Court does not consider it appropriate to determine the application by Synlait Milk Ltd to adduce further evidence at this stage.  However, the Court recognises that the respondents seek to adduce evidence in response to Synlait’s proposed new evidence. The respondents may file an application to adduce one or more affidavits in response to Synlait’s proposed evidence and the affidavits themselves.  The Court will hear argument on both applications at the hearing and determine them at or after the hearing.  [2] Counsel should make submissions on the alternative bases that:  (a)  leave is given to both parties to adduce new evidence; and   (b)  such leave is declined.    [3] We direct the Registrar to amend the Court file by substituting Synlait Milk Ltd for Stonehill Trustee Ltd as applicant (now appellant).

It is regrettable that counsel were unable to settle costs between them. I must now do so on the papers.  [2] The plaintiff commenced winding up proceedings against defendant on the basisof its failure tocomplywith astatutorydemand. Theoriginal hearing date was 26 September 2019. On that date,the matter was set down tobeheard on 10 October 2019.  [3] Subsequent to the original hearing date,but before the special fixture date, the defendantpaid theoutstandingdebt togetherwith acontribution to theplaintiff’scosts of $3,283.50.  The plaintiff claims costs of $4,289.50 (following some adjustments).  PAR COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED v MAH ENTERPRISES (FIJI) LIMITED [2019] NZHC 2722 [24 October 2019]  [4] Isee no reason whytheplaintiff should not have an order for its costs. These are calculated on a 2B basis which seems appropriate, and I can see no objection to Ms Inwood’s revised costs calculation of $4,289.50 (inclusive of disbursements). In his submissions Mr O’Connor suggests that the claim is being made for a defended hearingwhich did notoccur. Therewasahearingon the originaldateof 26 September 2019. Thehearing that did not occur was the special fixturescheduled for10 October 2019, and there is no claim in respect of that.  [5] The plaintiff will have an order in respect of its costs and disbursements of $4,289.50. In making that order I expressly record that the defendant has already contributed costs and disbursements of $3,283.50 leaving a balance to payof $1,006.

DOTCOM vATTORNEY-GENERAL[2019] NZCA509 [23October 2019]  REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byGoddard J)  [1] Mr Dotcom has been granted leave to appeal by the High Court in respect of  onequestion of law arising out of the decision of theHigh Court in Attorney General  v Dotcom:1  Can a request for personal information under the Privacy Act 1993 be transferredbytherecipientto anotheragencywhere therequestseeks urgency and the basis for the urgency request is not a matter that the recipient is able to sensiblyassess butthe agencyto which the requestistransferred is the only agency able to properly evaluate the claimed basis for the urgency request?   [2] The High Court declined leave to appeal on a number of other questions.  [3] Mr Dotcom seeks special leave to appeal to this Court in respect of one  additional question. We are satisfied that special leave ought to be granted in respect  of the following question, which has been reformulated in discussion with counsel at  the hearing of the application:  Is a request for urgency under s 37 of the PrivacyAct 1993 a relevant factor for an agency in determining whether to refuse a request for personal information under s 29(1)(j) of thatAct?

The application is opposed by the respondent, Liansen Mao, the owner of the property over which the caveat has been lodged.  [2] The application was called on 21 October 2019 (along with five other interlocutory applications brought by the same parties in litigation), that while broader in scope, encompasses the same land as that subject to these proceedings.  Given these other applications, there was accordingly not time to hear the application to sustain the caveat, and Mr Zhang, on behalf of Mr Mao, was in any event not prepared for the hearing to proceed, noting that the advice he had received from the Registry was only that the application would be called.  [3] In the circumstances, noting that the substantive proceedings are in fact complex and multi-faceted and that while Mr Zhang disputes that Green Land has a caveatable interest and is otherwise bound by a “no caveat” clause, I conclude it is nonetheless appropriate to make interim orders pursuant to s 143(4)(b) of the Land Transfer Act 2017 sustaining the caveat until the application has been properly argued and further orders issued.  [4] I therefore order that caveat 11536496.1 which has been registered against Mr Mao’s land as comprised in record of title 482726 not lapse pending further order of the Court.  [5] The Registry is directed to confer with counsel with regard to the first available date for a half-day fixture before me. Once a fixture has been allocated counsel are to prepare a joint memorandum confirming a timetable for the filing of submissions and any further evidence in respect of the application, and upon receipt of that memorandum I will issue timetable orders accordingly.

[2] Counsel for the defendants has by email queried Appendix A and [6] of my judgment.  As the parties are aware Appendix A was the wording adopted by the parties. Contrary to the submission made by counsel for the defendants Appendix A does not say the “order is to be in force up to 5 December 2019” it says the order is "to be in force up to after the next hearing on 5 December 2019”. As set out in [6] of the judgment I interpreted this phrase to mean the orders at Appendix A will therefore remain in force unless revoked (or indeed varied) on 4 December 2019, in contrast to the orders at Appendix B which will lapse unless extended on 4 December 2019, noting that the next hearing was set down for 4 rather than 5 December 2019.    [3] There is accordingly no error or slip and to the extent that counsel for the defendants has applied for a recall of the judgment, that application is dismissed.  Powell J

IN THE HIGH COURT OFNEWZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TEWHANGANUI-A-TARAROHE  CIV-2018-485-970 [2019] NZHC 2661  UNDER the Judicial Review ProcedureAct 2016  INTHE MATTER of an application for review of the exercise of statutory power by a body constituted under s 126 of the Lawyers and conveyancersAct 2006  BETWEEN ALAWYER Applicant  AND NEW ZEALANDLAWSOCIETY First Respondent  WELLINGTON STANDARDS COMMITTEE NO 2  On the papers  Counsel: F E Geiringer and J K Mahuta-Coyle forApplicant P N Collins for First Respondent  Judgment: 18 October 2019    JUDGMENT OFTHOMAS J (COSTS)  [1] On 13 August 2019 I issued a decision dismissing an application for judicial review by the applicant (a Lawyer).1 The respondents seek costs as the successful party on a 2B basis totalling $22,523 and disbursements of $934.05 to account for filing fees and travelling costs.2  1 A Lawyer v New Zealand Law Society [2019] NZHC 1961. 2 HighCourt Rules 2016, r14.2(1)(a).  ALAWYER v NEWZEALAND LAWSOCIETY[2019] NZHC2661[18 October 2019]  [2] TheLawyer asks the matterof costsbestayed as shehasappealed the decision. If the matter is not to be stayed, the Lawyer asks that band 2A be adopted for step 30, the preparation the common bundle and affidavits. She says this is because the Law Society only filed one brief affidavit and made no nominations for the common bundle. The majority of the common bundle comprised the Lawyer’s annexed documents. If adopted, this would result in a reduction for this step from costs of $6,690 to $3,066.25. In any case, the Lawyer notes that the Law Society claimed for a two-day hearing for this step rather than the one-and-a-half-days hearing that occurred.  [3] Thehearing indeed lasted onlya one-and-a-half-days.  The time allocation for step 30 should reflect that. The same logic applies to step 34, preparation for the hearing, and a re-calculation is appropriate for both steps.3 However, I do not accept that 2A costs are appropriate for step 30. There were a significant number of documents in the common bundle, all of which needed to be read and checked bythe Law Society. Just because it did not reject any documents, it does not follow that it spent no time on this step.  As such a 2B allocation is correct.  [4] Therearenospecial reasons whycostsshould not follow theevent in this case. 4   Result  [5] The award for steps 30 and 34 is reduced from $6,690 to $5,575. The total costs awarded on a2Bbasis istherefore $20,293. Reasonable disbursements totalling $934.05 are also appropriate and awarded.  [6] The Law Society is to file submissions on the Lawyer’s application for a stay within 14 days of the date of this judgment.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI PIRA O AOTEAROA  CA536/2014 [2019] NZCA 494  BETWEEN  PAULANTHONYKING Appellant   AND  NORFOLK NOMINEES LIMITED Respondent    Court: Kós P, Brown and Clifford JJ  Counsel: Appellant in person BAVautier for Respondent  Judgment: 16 October 2019 at 10.30 am (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  A The appeal is struck out.   B There is no order as to costs.  REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given by Clifford J)  [1] On 28 August 2014, Associate Judge Matthews adjudicated bankrupt theappellant, Paul Anthony King, on the application of the respondent, Norfolk Nominees Ltd.1 On24September 2014, MrKingfiled anoticeofappeal in this Court, alleging the Judge made numerous errors of fact and law.2  1  Norfolk Financial Management Ltd v King [2014] NZHC 2051.   2  Mr King did not apply for a suspension of the adjudication and his bankruptcy is unaffected by   this appeal.    KING vNORFOLK NOMINEES LIMITED [2019] NZCA494[16 October 2019]  [2] MrKingapplied for security forcosts to bedispensed with. TheRegistrar declined that application, a decision upheld on review by Stevens J, who ordered MrKing to pay security no later than 20March 2015. 3 Shortly before that date, MrKingapplied for an extension of time to paysecurityfor costs. Stevens Jdeclined to grant an extension.4  [3] Security for costs was never paid. Nor was the appeal deemed abandoned, because in December 2014 — within three months of the appeal being brought, as required — MrKing filed the case on appeal and a memorandum requesting theallocation of a hearing date.5  [4] Without payment of security for costs, the Registrar could not allocate a hearing date.6 The appeal therefore lay dormant for several years until, on 9August 2019, Clifford Jissued aminute warningMr Kingthat the Court intended to consider whether to strike out his appeal pursuant to r 44A of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005 for failing to prosecute it with due diligence and dispatch. The parties were invited to file memoranda. Mr King filed a lengthy memorandum reiteratingthe merits of his appeal and blamingthe Registrar forthe delay. MrVautier, for the respondent, submitted that the appeal should be struck out.  [5] Mr King’s criticism of the Registrar is misconceived: the inaction is due to thefact he did not pay security for costs when it fell due. He was given a full opportunityto do so. Four years havenowpassed and the appeal has seen no progress for far too long.  We are satisfied that Mr King has failed to prosecute the appeal with duediligence and dispatch.7  [6] The appeal is struck out.  [7] There is no order as to costs.

[2] The application has been made as a result of Mr Soroka having been issued a Police Safety Order pursuant to s 28 of the Family Violence Act 2018.   [3] A fundamental problem is immediately apparent with Mr Soroka’s application. That is, while s 3 of the Habeas Corpus Act 2001 defines detention as including “every form of restraint of liberty of the person” and Mr Soroka contends that his liberty has been restrained in various ways as a result of the order having been issued, it is quite clear that habeas corpus in New Zealand is firmly founded upon unlawful detention rather than the type of loss of liberty alleged by Mr Soroka.1 In particular it is clear “it is the detention or imprisonment … which must be impugned as lacking legal justification”.2 A Police Safety Order is not concerned with the actual detention or imprisonment of a person.  Quite simply Mr Soroka is not and has not been in detention for the purposes of the Habeas Corpus Act. As a result, Mr Soroka’s application must fail.  [4] More broadly, a Police Safety Order is designed to be a cooling-off measure allowing Police to take immediate action to protect people at risk of family harm and can be in force for a period not exceeding 10 days,3 in Mr Soroka’s case, a period of five days. That is not designed to be challenged is evident by the terms of s 55 of the Family Violence Act 2018 which protects “the Crown and constable” from proceedings in carrying out the provisions of the Act specific to Police Safety Orders, provided they have acted in good faith and with reasonable care.   [5] The application is dismissed.

In accordance with the directions as to costs made in my judgment, the applicants have filed their costs memorandum; they seek costs on a Category 2B basis.

Having confirmed that the appeal had been abandoned I gave leave for the respondent Ms Thompson to seek costs.  [2] Ms Thompson, through her counsel Mr Woodd, has now applied for costs on a 2B basis in the sum of $4,237 plus disbursements of $50, a total sum of $4,287.  [3] In response, Mr Prescott has not challenged the calculation of the costs claimed by Ms Thompson.  Instead, by memorandum he has asserted that his appeal remains on foot and has also filed a further memorandum entitled “Applicant’s application to stay costs pending a judicial review”. The latter document seeks a stay of any costs award pending “a judicial review of Judge Cunningham and an appeal as to the rights of self-represented lay litigants to claim costs if successful”.  [4] Leaving aside the procedural irregularity of what Mr Prescott is seeking, his appeal has in fact been abandoned, and there is no reason to stay any determination of costs given the costs relate entirely to the abandoned appeal. Any subsequent actions taken by Mr Prescott by way of judicial review against Judge Cunningham therefore have absolutely no bearing on Ms Thompson’s entitlement to costs on the appeal. To the extent it is necessary to do so, Mr Prescott’s application for stay is accordingly dismissed.  [5] Having considered Ms Thompson’s application, I am satisfied it should be granted as sought, given Ms Thompson incurred costs on the appeal and it has now been abandoned.  [6] I therefore order that Ms Thompson is entitled to costs against Mr Prescott in the sum of $4,237 plus disbursements of $50, a total of $4,287.  Powell J

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANANUI   SC 43/2017   [2019] NZSC 110   BETWEEN  TONY DOUGLAS ROBERTSON   Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN   Respondent    Court: Glazebrook, O’Regan and Ellen France JJ Counsel: Applicant in person M J Lillico for Respondent Judgment: 10 October 2019  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall of this Court’s judgment in Robertson v R [2017] NZSC 101 is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] Mr Robertson has applied for a recall of this Court’s judgment in Robertson v R  (the leave judgment).1 In the leave judgment the Court dismissed Mr Robertson’s  application for leave to appeal from his unsuccessful appeal in the Court of Appeal  against his conviction after trial for the murder and rape of Blesilda Gotingco.2 Leave  to appeal to this Court was brought on the basis that manslaughter should have been  left to the jury.3  1 Robertson v R [2017] NZSC 101.  Elias CJ, who was on the earlier panel, has retired.  O’Regan J has replaced her Honour on the panel.  2 Robertson v R [2016] NZCA 99 (Harrison, Miller and Cooper JJ). The events giving rise to the charges occurred in late May 2014.  Mr Robertson hit Mrs Gotingco with his car causing her serious injuries.  He put her in his car and took her to his nearby home where he stabbed her.  3 This was not a ground raised in the Court of Appeal.  TONY DOUGLAS ROBERTSON v R [2019] NZSC 110 [10 October 2019]  [2] In dismissing the application for leave, this Court’s assessment was that nothing raised by the applicant suggested there was a credible narrative in the evidence for a manslaughter verdict.4  [3] The application for recall is brought on the basis Mr Robertson’s counsel on the leave application did not make submissions as to various evidential matters Mr Robertson says he was instructed to put forward.  Mr Robertson wishes to argue these matters show there was a credible narrative for manslaughter.5 These matters were however set out in some detail in the application for leave to appeal to this Court.6 The impact of these matters as they related to the Crown and defence cases at trial was considered by the Court in the leave judgment at [7]–[13].  The application for recall accordingly in substance is an attempt to re-argue the application for leave.  Nothing has been advanced which would warrant a recall of our decision not to grant leave.  [4] The application for recall is accordingly dismissed.  Solicitors: Crown Law Office, Wellington for Respondent   4 The leave judgment noted the effect of the authorities was that where there was a credible narrative in the evidence for a manslaughter verdict, the possibility of manslaughter should be left: at [6].  5 Mr Robertson’s evidence at trial was that he believed Mrs Gotingco was dead and he acted without murderous intent in stabbing her.  He denied strangling or raping her.  6 The application records the submission that the evidence at trial provided a credible narrative and then lists various matters beginning with, by way of example, the finding by the Court of Appeal that the running down was accidental.  Other matters referred to include the pathologist’s evidence about the cause of death, the absence of defensive injuries, and mishandling of the introital swab.

(b)  Did the High Court err in holding that the Pauls were entitled to, and did validly, cancel the contract because Jade’s suspension of, and failure to return to, work on the contract site constituted a repudiation of the contract?

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors: Sinisa Law, Otahuhu Loo & Koo (Barristers & Solicitors), Auckland  Counsel: N King, Otahuhu  WANG v MA [2019] NZHC 2468 [30 September 2019]  [1] In a judgment dated 15 April 2019, I dismissed the appeal brought by the appellant, Zengyun Wang, against a reserved judgment of Judge E B Parsons in the Family Court at Auckland dated 21 September 2018.   [2] In a subsequent judgment dated 19 July 2019, I refused leave to Ms Wang for a second appeal on the basis that the document filed by her did not raise a question of law or fact that engaged serious argument and involved sufficiently important public or private interests to outweigh the cost and delay of a further appeal.   [3] The respondent, Guoliang Ma, has now filed a memorandum seeking the Court’s determination as to costs.  He submits that costs should follow the event, with costs on a 2B basis being awarded to him.  I gave the opportunity to both Mr Ma and Ms Wang to file submissions on the issue of costs.  I have now received submissions from them both.  [4] Costs of $10,258 was sought by counsel for Mr Ma.  These costs are specified in a schedule attached to his application.  Counsel for Ms Wang has responded on the basis that there had been a slight error in calculation, in that the 0.3 days claimed for appearance at a case management conference on 22 January 2019 should be 0.2 days.  This would reduce the costs sought slightly to $10,035.  No other issue was raised.  [5] Accordingly, I direct that the appellant, Ms Wang, is to pay the respondent, Mr Ma, the sum of $10,035 as standard costs for her failed appeal.  I note, however, that Ms Wang deposited the sum of $2,300 in the High Court trust account as security for costs. I therefore direct that that sum, together with the interest thereon, is to paid out to the successful respondent, Mr Ma.  The difference between that sum and the sum of $10,035 is to be paid directly by Ms Wang to Mr Ma.   Woolford J

[2] The evidence on which the applicant relies is contained in an extensive affidavit of Tracy Margaret Bruce, apolice constable holdingrank of Detective. Detective Bruce has been a police officer for 25 years and appends to her affidavit a number of important documents concerning criminal activity that has taken place at the property that is the subject of this application.   [3] It appears on the face of the evidence before me that the propertyis tainted as that is defined in s5 of the Act by virtue of both direct and indirect links with the alleged criminal activity.

REASONS  [1] Mr Howse was convicted in 1999 of an aggravated robbery and associated abduction and sexual offending.1 He was sentenced to preventive detention.  He applies to this Court for leave to appeal against that conviction and sentence.  [2] The Crown has found no record of any appeal to the Court of Appeal in relation to this offending. Mr Howse’s application therefore seems to be for a first appeal to this Court.  R v Howse HC Wellington T No 1944/98, 19 February 1999 (Neazor J).

His solicitor at the time of his death, Kathleen Byrne, applies for an order declaring a document to be a valid will.  [2] An affidavit from Hineawe Green, the solicitor from Ms Byrne’s office who attended on Mr Alexander and prepared the will establishes that on 15 January 2019 Mr Alexander instructed her to prepare a new will. The new will was effectively the same as a will he had earlier executed (in 2002) except that it omitted reference to a debt that had since been repaid and named Ms Byrne as the executor instead of the solicitor, Mr Peter Harrison, who had retired.  [3] A will was drafted in accordance with Mr Alexander’s instructions and emailed to him on 31 January 2019.  A response was received that day from Mr Alexander’s niece, who advised that Mr Alexander had died earlier that morning.  Enid Florence Alexander, Mr Alexander’s wife, who was to be the other executor of the new will and was one of the three named beneficiaries in it, had died three days earlier.  ESTATE ALEXANDER [2019] NZHC 2373 [19 September 2019]  [4] Ms Byrne’s affidavit annexes the signed consent to the present application by the other named beneficiaries, the Alexanders’ two sons, Neville Graham Alexander and Laurence Ross Alexander.  [5] Section 14 provides:  14  High Court may declare will valid  (1)  This section applies to a document that–   (a)  appears to be a will; and   (b)  does not comply with section 11; and   (c)  came into existence in or out of New Zealand.     (2)  The High Court may make an order declaring the document valid, if it is satisfied that the document expresses the deceased person’s testamentary intentions.   (3)  The court may consider–   (a)  the document; and   (b)  evidence on the signing and witnessing of the document; and   (c)  evidence on the deceased person’s testamentary intentions; and   (d)  evidence of statements made by the deceased person.      [6] The evidence satisfies me that the requirements of s 14 are met here.

REASONS  Introduction  [1] Mr Gizelis was convicted after trial of sexual violation by rape and kidnapping. He appealed unsuccessfully against conviction to the Court of Appeal and now seeks leave to appeal to this Court.1 The proposed appeal relates to the admissibility of DNA evidence called at trial.  Gizelis v R [2019] NZCA 77 (French, Dobson and Brewer JJ) [CA judgment].  PAVLOS PAUL GIZELIS v R [2019] NZSC 94 [30 August 2019]   Background  [2] The complainant performed oral sex on Mr Gizelis in his car for money. At  that point, the car was parked in central Auckland.  She then fell asleep.  Whilst she  was asleep, Mr Gizelis had driven the car about 30 minutes north of Auckland.  The  complainant said that when she woke up, several hours later, Mr Gizelis was having  unprotected sexual intercourse with her in the car.  She said she protested but he  continued.  She recalled feeling semen running down her leg.   [3] Mr Gizelis voluntarily provided a DNA sample but declined to make a  statement to the police.  [4] The prosecution led expert evidence at trial about the results of the DNA testing  undertaken.  This evidence is described by the Court of Appeal as follows:  [7] … Scientists identified the presence of sperm in the complainant’s vaginal swabs, but no DNA of any male was identifiable in that sample. Tests were also undertaken on the seat in Mr Gizelis’s car on which it was alleged the intercourse had occurred.  That only revealed a probable semen stain containing DNA that was likely from the complainant and DNA from an unidentified person.  No DNA matching Mr Gizelis’s was present in any of the samples. …  [8] Samples were also taken from the complainant’s undergarments. These revealed no semen, but the probable presence of saliva staining. This contained DNA from at least three people, one being the complainant, but the remaining DNA was found unsuitable for comparison.  [5] A scientist from the Institute of Environmental Science and Research told the  jury there could be a number of explanations for the DNA testing results obtained.2  [6] The defence at trial was that the complainant willingly went with Mr Gizelis  in the car after oral sex and there had been no sexual intercourse. The defence did not  object to the admission of the DNA evidence but rather, used it to support the defence.  In particular, the complainant’s evidence was that she had had unprotected sex with  The scientist explained that in samples containing a very high concentration of DNA (not uncommon for swabs of an intimate nature), a high concentration of DNA from the complainant would be expected.  In those cases, where there is a lesser concentration of DNA from another person, that DNA may simply get “swamped out”.  her partner days before the incident and the defence said that this provided a possible explanation for the sperm identified in the vaginal swabs.  [7] In summing up, the trial Judge, Judge Sharp, explained there was no obligation on Mr Gizelis to provide a DNA sample but he had done so voluntarily.  The Judge told the jury that when Mr Gizelis provided the DNA sample, “he could not be said to have been attempting to engineer a defence, because he didn’t know anything about the allegations that were made against him”. The Judge also explained the effect of the DNA evidence and in this context, directed the jury in this way:  [46] … What that boils down to in legal terms is you don’t have elements that can prove anything in the case against Mr Gizelis. There is simply nothing that you could rely on to demonstrate that he had sex in the car with [the complainant]. You might find it from other evidence, but that evidence can’t help you. The aspect to that that he provided the voluntary DNA sample means he put himself up for the testing to take place and you are entitled to take that into consideration.  [47] Now the other factor is the evidence from [the complainant], at least as she told it to the police, was that she was aware of the absence of a condom because she noticed stuff running down her legs. Now this evidence might be hard to rationalise against the scientific material. It’s something that you will consider and it will be your view of it that's important.   The proposed appeal  [8] Mr Gizelis says the proposed appeal would raise a general question about the relevance of forensic evidence and that the admission of this evidence has given rise to a miscarriage of justice. In relation to the latter point, Mr Gizelis seeks to argue on appeal, first, that the DNA evidence was not relevant because it could not show the DNA could have come from Mr Gizelis.3 Second, it would be argued on appeal that the expert evidence was inadmissible opinion evidence as it could not have provided substantial help to the jury.4 Finally, Mr Gizelis wishes to argue that even if the DNA evidence was relevant, it should have been excluded because the risk of unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of this evidence.5  3 Evidence Act 2006, s 7. 4 Evidence Act, s 25. 5 Evidence Act, s 8.  [9] The admissibility of the evidence and the effect of its admission was considered by the Court of Appeal.  In terms of relevance, the Court agreed with the submission for the respondent to the effect that DNA evidence, “is so much a stock part of investigations of allegations of rape that its omission would be likely to distract a jury”.6 In particular, the Court took the view that:  [25] … The fact such testing had been undertaken, along with its outcome, was relevant to the issues in dispute, irrespective of the outcome. The Judge’s observations mentioned above acknowledge the forensic evidence’s potential relevance; this relevance being inconsistent with exclusion of the forensic evidence on the grounds argued on the appeal by [the applicant’s counsel].  [10] Nor did the Court consider that the admission of the evidence gave rise to a risk of a miscarriage of justice.  [11] The Court’s conclusion about the relevance of the evidence reflected an assessment of the particular facts.  No question of general or public importance accordingly arises.7  [12] Nor do we consider any appearance of a miscarriage of justice arises from the Court of Appeal’s consideration of these issues.8 The Court made the point that, absent any challenge to the admissibility of this evidence, “and particularly where the defence was likely to place positive reliance on the DNA evidence (as it did), it would have been untenable for the trial Judge to take an initiative to rule it inadmissible”.9 In addition, any potential concerns about prejudicial effect were addressed by the directions of the Judge set out above which were favourable to the defence. The criteria for leave are not met.  [13] The application for leave to appeal is accordingly dismissed.

REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks recall of this Court’s judgment dismissing her application for leave to appeal and awarding costs against her.1  [2] The decision against which she sought to appeal was a decision of a Judge of the Court of Appeal upholding a decision of the Deputy Registrar of that Court to refuse to accept for filing an application for leave to appeal against a High Court decision on the basis that there was no right of appeal against the High Court decision.  Howard v Accident Compensation Corporation [2019] NZSC 78.  MAREE HOWARD v ACCIDENT COMPENSATION CORPORATION [2019] NZSC 92 [26 August 2019]  [3] The application for recall does not raise any matter that would justify the recall of this Court’s judgment.  None of the grounds for recall set out in Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2) applies.2 The application is therefore dismissed.  [4] The Registrar is instructed to decline to accept for filing any further applications for recall.

REASONS  Introduction  [1] Mr Hill seeks leave to appeal from adecision oftheCourt of Appeal striking out his appeal for non-payment of security forcosts.1   Background  [2] Theappeal struck out bythe Court ofAppeal relates to ajudgment declining MrHill’s application to set aside a bankruptcy notice.2 This matter arises in the context of a long-running dispute between Mr Hill and the Maori Trustee. The  1 Hill v Maori Trustee [2019] NZCA243 (French, Miller and Wild JJ)[CAjudgment]. 2 Maori Trustee v Hill [2017] NZHC 2377.  FREDRICK HILLvMAORI TRUSTEE [2019] NZSC 89[19August 2019]  backgroundto this disputeis set outin this Court’s earlier judgment decliningleaveto appeal from an earlier judgment of the Court of Appeal concerning the payment of security forcosts.3  [3] In determiningthe appeal should bestruck out, the Court of Appeal noted the “extensive procedural history” relating to security for costs.4 The Court recorded the submission for the Maori Trustee that the “lengthy delays” in the proceeding “have caused significant prejudice to the Maori Trustee and the beneficial owners” affected bytheunderlyingdispute.5 TheCourt also observed that Mr Hill’s position beforethe Court was that he was “unable to say when” security would be paid.6  [4] Against this background the Court said:  [6] The Court has already held that there is no reason why the Maori Trustee should nothave thebenefitof securityforcosts.  We are notprepared to reopen the questions whether theyought to be paid,or whether theyought to be reduced.  [5] The application to strikeout the appeal was accordinglygranted.   The proposed appeal  [6] No question of general or public importance arises out of the approach taken.7 Nor does anything raised give rise to the appearance of a miscarriage of justice.8 MrHill’s submissions are primarily directed to other matters such as the approach taken bythe legal aid authorities and the Maori Trustee. Theproposed appeal would not challengeanymatter of principlearisingfrom the decision to strike out the appeal.  [7] Theapplication forleaveto appeal is dismissed.

By minute dated 24 July 2019, Hinton J noted the proceedings had been discontinued.  The respondent now seeks costs and counsel for the applicant has confirmed she does not wish to be heard on the application.   Costs sought  [2] The respondent simply seeks costs on a 2B basis in respect of the two applications adjusted slightly to reflect the actual costs incurred by the respondent.    Discussion  [3] As noted, no issue has been taken by the applicant with the quantum of costs sought and I can see no basis upon which the order should not be made.  [4] The respondent is entitled to costs against the applicant in CIV-2018-404-2259 and CIV-2018-404-2261 in the sum of $11,087.90 plus disbursements of $330.43, a total of $11,418.33.  Powell J

Registrar / Deputy Registrar  Solicitors:  Crown Solicitor, Tauranga  And to:  Appellant  LEEF v R [2019] NZHC 1897[6August 2019]  [1] Inthe sittingtoday, Marion Leef was scheduledto appearto present her appeal.  The Crown is represented and ready to proceed.  [2] When the appeal was called today, Ms Leef made no appearance.  [3] Earlier, on 19 June 2019,Toogood J issued a minute in which he gave various directions regarding Ms Leef’s pursuit of this appeal. The Judge recognised at paragraph [9] of the minute that s 338 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 (Act) provides that an appeal Court may dismiss an appeal if the appellant fails to comply with timetable or other procedural orders fixed for the appeal.  [4] As at 19 June 2019, Ms Leef was in default for filing her submissions. She had not however, at that time, been given noticeof thedefaultas isrequired bys 338(2) of the Act. Accordingly, in the minute of 19 June 2019, Toogood J gave Ms Leef notice that unless she filed and served her submissions in support of the appeal as directed, the appeal would be dismissed under s 338(1) of the Act without further notice to her.  [5] In addition to her non-appearance today, I note that Ms Leef took no steps to file her submissions in compliance with the directions given by Toogood J, despite being given notice that non-compliance would lead to the appeal being struck out.  [6] In light of Ms Leef’s failure to comply with the directions of Toogood J and her absence at the appeal hearing today, I am satisfied that it is now appropriate for her appeal to be struck out pursuant to s 338 of the Act.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors/Counsel: C Muston, Whangarei. Marsden Woods Inskip Smith, Whangarei.  ROBINSON v WOEST [2019] NZHC 1879 [5 August 2019]  [1] Mr John Robinson sued Mr Ernest Woest and Mrs Cindy Woest.  Mr Robinson’s suit was dismissed because he failed to comply with an unless order. Mr and Mrs Woest seek 2B costs.  On behalf of Mr Robinson, Mr Muston acknowledges his client is liable for costs.  But, Mr Muston contends these should not extend to memoranda filed by Mr and Mrs Woest on 20 June, 8 July and 18 July 2019, or the expenses of an arborist, engineer and surveyor—experts retained by the Woests.  [2] The expenses in relation to the experts were reasonably necessary for the conduct of the defence, and reasonable in amount.1 They are recoverable from Mr Robinson. Time in relation to the three memoranda is also recoverable under step 36; the memoranda addressed relevant matters in relation to the conduct of the suit. For example, Toogood J directed the Woests to file a memorandum if Mr Robinson did not comply with the unless order. Their 18 July memorandum complied with this direction.  [3] Mr Muston also questioned whether scale costs exceeded actual costs. As is well known, a litigant may not claim costs greater than those incurred.  Ms Golightly, counsel for Mr and Mrs Woest, has confirmed her firm’s costs are greater than those sought.  [4] So, I award Mr and Mrs Woest $23,638 in costs and $10,343.43 disbursements.  …………………………….. Downs J  High Court Rules 2016, r 14.12(2). 
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEWZEALAND PALMERSTON NORTH REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TE PAPAIOEAROHE  CRI-2019-454-000012  BETWEEN  CONNOR BEVINS   Appellant   AND  THE QUEEN   Respondent    Counsel: W E Kronast forAppellant J J Harvey and E R Pairman for Respondent  Date: 5 August 2019   AMENDED FURTHER ORDERS OFCOOKE J  [1] Further to my minute of 26 July 2019, when allowing the appeal in these proceedings I did not deal with the question of special release conditions. These are set bythe Court under s 93(2)of the Sentencing Act 2002 given that the sentence was more than 12 months but not greater than 24 months. In the circumstances it is appropriate to correct that omission under r 1.6 of the Criminal ProcedureRules 2012, and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court. It is possible that the special conditions may not be relevant if the District Court permits home detention, but whether that will be permitted is obviously not known at the present time.  [2] Thestandard release conditions apply as aresultof s93(2)(a). Special release conditions are appropriate in this case. In my minute I considered the special conditions proposed in the PAC report and invited memoranda from counsel by 30 July 2019. I received a memorandum from counsel for the respondent dated 29 July 2019. No memorandum has been received from counsel for Mr Bevins. The Registry has followed up, but nothing has been filed. The Crown seeks the special conditions as set out in the PAC report.  [3] In the circumstances I conclude the following special conditions should be imposed.  Mr Bevins is to:  (a)  attend and complete an appropriate Department Programme to the satisfaction of the Probation Officer. The specific details of the appropriate programme shall be determined by a Probation Officer;   (b)  undertake and complete the Maintenance Programme and abide bythe rules of the Programme to the satisfaction of a Probation Officer;   (c)  attend an assessment for aAlcohol and DrugProgrammeas directed by a Probation Officer, and to attend and complete any counselling, treatment orprogrammeas recommended bytheassessment as directed by and to the satisfaction of a Probation Officer; and   (d)  is not to associate with, or contact the victims of his offending without the prior written approval of a Probation Officer.    [4] I do not impose the special condition considering the use of electronic devices capable of accessing the internet, as it seems to me that that goes too far.  [5] Under s 93(2)(b) Idirect that the conditions expireonthesentenceexpirydate.

She says she has been through due process in the District Court and sheoriginallyintended to appeal to the High Court. She alsowishes to pursuea habeas corpus application. She says she has been unlawfully detained and held at a women’s prison against her wishes. She references He Whakaputanga of 1835 and purports to proclaimcustomary law. Shedoes not agreesheis the person who should have been arrested. Implicitly, she rejects the jurisdiction of the Court, though she applies to the Court.  [2] The courts have consistently rejected challenges to their jurisdiction such as that raised byMs TeAmo.1 It is misconceived in terms of New Zealand law. So is the distinction between alegal and natural person Ms TeAmo appears to advance. I am bound to exercise the jurisdiction of the High Court and apply the law of New Zealand. TheHabeas Corpus Act 2001 provides for restoringthelibertyofthose who are unlawfully detained. Under s 14, I must enquire into the matters of fact and law claimed to justify the detention and, if the defendant fails to establish detention is lawful, Imustgrant awrit of habeas corpus, orderingthe releaseof the detained person from detention.  [3] TheDepartment of Corrections has provided me with relevant documentation.  Ms TeAmo is serving a sentence of two months’imprisonment imposed by Judge T R Ingram in the District Court at Tauranga on 23 July 2019 for a range of offences includingassaultingand resistingpoliceand wilful damage. Sheis currentlydetained at AucklandRegion Women’s Corrections Facility at Manukau. Ihave seen avalid warrant of commitment dated 23 July2019 which Iam satisfied demonstrates that Ms TeAmo was lawfully imprisoned.  Accordingly, I decline the application for a writ of habeas corpus. Ms Te Amo, if you wish to pursue an appeal of your conviction or sentence that will have to be done separately.  Palmer J  See, for example, Wallace v R [2011] NZSC 10.

REASONS  [1] Mr Slavich has been declared avexatious litigant and, as such, cannot institute or continue any civil proceedings without the leave of the High Court (subject to matters on foot in CIV-2012-404-6353 as at 27 March 2013).1 In a minute dated 24March 2015 Winkelmann J madeadirection inCIV-2012-404-6353 that no further applications or correspondence were to be received by the High Court Registry in respect of the order declaring him to be a vexatious litigant.  [2] On 17 September 2018 Mr Slavich sought to file an application in the High Court to recall the judgment in that proceeding on the basis that fresh evidence had come to light. A Deputy Registrar refused to accept the application for filing. MrSlavich requested a review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision. The Registrar declined to action that request. Mr Slavich wrote to the Chief High Court Judge,  Attorney-General v Slavich [2013] NZHC 627.  SLAVICH vATTORNEY-GENERAL[2019] NZCA342 [29 July2019]  Venning J, requestingthat hedirect the Registrar to action his request for a review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision. Venning J refused on the basis that the Deputy Registrar was acting in compliance with Winkelmann J’s minute of 24 March 2015 and that thedecision was therefore not amenable to being reviewed.   [3] On 14 December 2018 Mr Slavich filed a document in this Court entitled “Notice of appeal or as the alternative a late notice of appeal” in which he sought to appeal “the decision ofJusticeVenning or as thealternativealateNoticeofAppeal of the Minute decision of Justice Winkelmann dated 24 March 2015”. A Deputy Registrar of this Court responded:  We acknowledge receipt ofyourdocuments filed on13 December2018. This document has been accepted as a R29Aapplication for an extension of time to appeal the Minute ofWinkelmann J of 24 March 2015.  [4] Although Mr Slavich’s notice had been explicitly styled as the alternatives of a notice of appeal against Venning J’s decision or a late notice of appeal against Winkelmann J’s minute it is evident that the Deputy Registrar approached the filing on the basisthat VenningJ’s letterwas not ajudgment capable of appeal (it was not in the form of a judgment or minute and did not purport to exercise any judicial power.  [5] Mr Slavich took a different view. He asked what the Court’s position was on the application relating to the appeal of Venning J’s decision. The Deputy Registrar confirmed the earlier position. Mr Slavich has requested a review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision not to accept the noticeofappeal againstVenningJ’s decision for filing i.e. review under r 5A(3) of the Court ofAppeal (Civil) Rules 2005.   [6] TheDeputyRegistrar acted correctly. VenningJ’s letterwas simplyaresponse to the request contained in Mr Slavich’s earlier letter. It was not a decision that attracted any right of appeal.

[2] In the event, NJW’s counsel filed a memorandum dated 25 March 2019, calculating 2B costs at $12,655.25, but (given HCR 14.2(1)(f)’s principle “an award of costs should not exceed the costs incurred by the party claiming costs”) properly acknowledges NJW’s legally-aided costs are $2,807.38, which are claimed instead.  [3] TRS has not responded, despite the Registry’s enquiry.  [4] Isee no reason to divert from mypreliminaryview (although Iwould not have allowed for preparation of the case on appeal, as falling to the appellant to prepare, reducing 2B costs to $10,425.25)2 .

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANANUI SC 21/2018 [2019] NZSC 74  BETWEEN COLIN GRAEME CRAIG Appellant and Cross-Respondent  AND JORDAN HENRY WILLIAMS Respondent and Cross-Appellant  Court: Winkelmann CJ, Glazebrook, O’Regan, Ellen France and Williams JJ  Counsel: S J Mills QC, J W J Graham, T F Cleary and for Appellant P A McKnight and A J Romanos for Respondent  Judgment: 17 July 2019  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for a stay of the costs orders is dismissed.   REASONS  [1] Mr Williams successfully sued Mr Craig in defamation and the jury awarded Mr Williams damages of $1.27 million.1 Subsequently the trial judge, Katz J, set aside the jury’s verdict and ordered a retrial on the basis of an excessive damages award and a jury misdirection.2 The Court of Appeal overturned Katz J’s finding, entered judgment in accordance with the jury’s verdict on liability and ordered a retrial on the question of damages.3  1 The jury trial ran for four weeks from 5 September to 29 September 2016. 2 Williams v Craig [2017] NZHC 724, [2017] 3 NZLR 215 [Retrial judgment]. 3 Williams v Craig [2018] NZCA 31, [2018] 3 NZLR 1 (Harrison, Miller and Gilbert JJ).  COLIN GRAEME CRAIG v JORDAN HENRY WILLIAMS [2019] NZSC 74 [17 July 2019]  [2] On appeal to this Court, Mr Craig’s appeal was allowed and a general retrial on liability and damages was ordered.4 Mr Williams’ cross-appeal was dismissed. This Court made the following orders as to costs: the costs award in the Court of Appeal was set aside and Mr Williams was ordered to pay costs of $35,000 plus usual disbursements to Mr Craig.  [3] Mr Williams applied for a recall of this Court’s judgment.  His application was dismissed, and he was ordered to pay costs of $3,500 to Mr Craig.5  [4] Mr Williams, by memorandum of 3 July 2019, accepts that he should pay the costs order of $3,500 on the recall application. He also accepts the disbursements figure of $10,872.26 with regard to the substantive appeal, as set out in the appellant’s memorandum of 2 May 2019. He, however, seeks a stay of the costs orders on the substantive appeal judgment pending the outcome of the retrial ordered by this Court.  [5] The only reason Mr Williams puts forward is that the stay should be granted “[d]ue to the very unusual circumstances of this case”.  It may be that this argument is based on the possibility that he may be successful in the retrial.  [6] Even assuming this is Mr Williams’ argument, we accept Mr Craig’s submission that no proper basis has been advanced for granting the stay application. Mr Craig was after all successful on his appeal before this Court.  [7] The stay application is dismissed.

Registrar / Deputy Registrar  Solicitors/Counsel: WynyardWood, CityOffice,Auckland Sarah Hughes, Wellington  ARG vBKL[2019] NZHC 1659[17 July2019]  [1] My judgment of 1 July 2019, dismissing ARG’s appeal against parenting orders made under the Care of Children Act 2004 (the “Act”), took the preliminary view BKL was entitled to 2B costs and disbursements.1  [2] BKL accepts that view, but (given HCR 14.2(1)(f)’s principle “an award of costs should not exceed the costs incurred by the party claiming costs”) properly acknowledges BKL’s legally-aided costsarelikelyto belessthan if calculated at scale.  [3] ARG, however, resists paying costs to BKLon grounds:  (a)  given the background of disputes between the parties in other proceedings, including in other courts, in which payment of costs had not been pursued, even when ordered;   (b)  even though unsuccessful, pursuit of the appeal gave the parties clarity as to their respective obligations under the parenting orders; and   (c)  such clarity advanced the welfare and best interests of the children, which is the first and paramount consideration in all matters under the Act,2 not to be discouraged by the prospect of costs liabilities.    [4] I am not prepared to have regard for the parties’conduct in other proceedings as arelevant consideration on an award of costs in this. Although Iacknowledgecosts should not be such as to deter parents from pursing their children’s welfare and best interests,3 that is not the present case on an unsuccessful appeal. If the lower court’s decision was not understood, there were more direct ways in the circumstances of obtaining its clarification than launching an appeal. And the appeal was illegitimately broad, even beyond that clarification.  [5] I order ARG pay BKL costs and disbursements in the amount incurred, to a maximum of $9,812.00 calculated as 2B costs.  —Jagose J  1  ARG v BKL [2019] NZHC 1514 at [26].   2  Care of ChildrenAct 2004, s 4.   3  Hawthorne v Cox [2008] NZCA146 at  [26]-[28].

DWAYNE RUSSELL WARAKIHI MAAKA SMYTH-DAVOREN v DAVID PARKER [2019] NZSC 70 [8 July 2019]  REASONS  [1] Mr Smyth-Davoren has applied for reviews of this Court’s judgments in Smyth-Davoren v Parker1 and in Smyth-Davoren v Mountbatten2 (the leave judgments).  In these judgments the Court dismissed Mr Smyth-Davoren’s applications for leave to appeal. We have treated the applications for review as applications to recall the leave judgments.  [2] Nothing has been put forward by Mr Smyth-Davoren which would warrant a recall of the leave judgments. At best, the matters raised by Mr Smyth-Davoren attempt to re-argue his applications for leave. The Court had considered the submissions that were made by Mr Smyth-Davoren in relation to those applications. There are no grounds to recall the leave judgments and the applications are therefore dismissed.  [3] We direct the Registrar to reject any further applications to review or recall the leave judgments.

[2] Where multiple parties to court proceedings are liable for costs, it is for the party entitled to costs to elect against whom an order for costs will be sought. In this case, there is no basis for the Court to question that decision.  [3] I am satisfied that the amount claimed is consistent with the schedules for calculating costs and disbursements under the rules,2 and that there is no basis upon which the Court should reduce the costs payable.3  [4] Accordingly, I direct the first respondent to pay to the applicant costs of $12,376.50 and disbursements of $1,351.33, a total of$13,727.83.

Registrar / Deputy Registrar  Solicitors: Marsden Woods Inskip Smith, Whangarei McMahon ButterworthThompson,Auckland  TUMATATORO LTD v HJSAGLTD [2019] NZHC 1537[2July2019]  [1] The respondent, who was successful in this proceeding, now seeks costs on a 2Bbasisand disbursements. Theunsuccessful applicant has recentlychanged counsel.  New counsel, Mr Utting, has filed memoranda requesting extensions of time in order to enable him to see if a negotiated position on costs could be reached. Seemingly, that has been unsuccessful.  [2] On 26 June 2019 he sought time until 28 June 2019 to discuss the potential resolution of the costs issue with the respondent’s counsel. The respondent has now been incontact with the Court to advise that noagreement in relation to costs has been reached and accordinglythe respondent seeks delivery of a costs judgment.  [3] In principal, costs generally follow the event. Further, awards of costs at category 2B level do not require reasons; such awards being the implicit application of the general principle.1  [4] The final memorandum from the applicant records that it accepts the position as set out in the respondent’s costs memorandum in relation to an award of costs on a category2Bbasis to the respondent. Noissueis taken with the quantification of those costs.   [5] Accordingly, Iam satisfied that an awardof costs as sought bythe respondent, is appropriate. Those costs on a 2B basis come to $11,930.50. With the addition of disbursements, the overall total is $12,132.00. Iam satisfied the disbursements sought are reasonable and accordingly, I award the respondent costs and disbursements as sought.   Result  [6] The respondent is awarded costs (on category 2B basis) and disbursements in the sum of $12,132.00.

[2] Shelf implicitlyaccepts itis liableto pay2B costs, savein relation to the case on appeal.  Shelf disputes therearegrounds for increased costs, noting it successfully identified an error of law in the District Court judgment. It maintains it may well succeed when the claim goes to trial.  [3] My reasons can be verybrief.   [4] Frema was successful. Costs should follow the event.3 However, no increase is justified. Frema’s allegation of bad faith is unsubstantiated. And, as Shelf observes, it identified an error of law in the District Court judgment. I also accept Shelf’s submission Frema cannot claim for step 55, preparation of the case on appeal.

[2] I heard counsel on the interim orders application in circumstances of considerable urgency on the afternoon of Wednesday, 26 June 2019.  At the conclusion of the hearing, I warned counsel that the extent of my other commitments as Duty Judge this week might preclude the completion of a reasoned judgment on the application before a decision was required by today.     [3] That has proven to be the case and I am accordingly issuing a results judgment with the intention of providing reasons for it as soon as other commitments allow.     [4] I decline the application for interim orders.  I do so on terms that no steps that the Navy might take between release of this judgment and final determination of the application for judicial review can have any bearing on the merits of the substantive argument, or on the scope of any relief.  By way of example, if a new bassoonist is employed hereafter, then that circumstance could not have any bearing on the appropriate relief if grounds for review are made out.

B The question on which leave is granted is:  Did the High Court errin fact andlaw when it held there was not a grave risk that the child would be placed in an intolerable situation upon being returned toAustralia?    REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given by Courtney J)  [1] In 2017 M, a New Zealand citizen living in Australia, brought her then three year old son, H, to New Zealand. H was born in Australia and is an Australian citizen. The Central Authority applied under the Hague Convention on the Civil  LRR v COL[2019] NZCA248[24 June 2019]  Aspects of International Child Abduction (the Convention) and s 105 of the Care of Children Act 2004 (theAct) onbehalf H’s father, F, also anAustralian citizen, seeking an order that H be returned to Australia.1  [2] The Family Court refused to make the order on the ground that H would be placed in an intolerable situation if he were returned to Australia.2 On appeal, Simon France J reversed the Family Court’s decision.3 M seeks leave under s 145(1)(b) of the Act to appeal theHigh Court decision. Shesaysthat theappeal concerns questions of law and fact that are capable of bona fide argument and which are of broad public interest and sufficient importance in relation to the interpretation and application of the Convention to justify leave being granted. Specifically, she asserts that the correct approach to determiningwhether an “intolerable situation” will exist for the purposes of s 106(1)(c) should be clarified in light of the extensive consideration given to this aspect in other jurisdictions4 since this Court’s decision in A v Central Authority of New Zealand.5  [3] We accept that further consideration of A v Central Authority is appropriate. Leave to appeal is granted. The question on which leave is granted is:  Did the High Court err in fact and law when it held there was not a grave risk that the child would be placed in an intolerable situation upon being returned to Australia?

[4] Annexed to the applicant’s affidavit is a health practitioner’s certificate of mental incapacity in respect of the respondent and his enduring power of attorney in relation to property. The medical practitioner has certified that as a result of an assessment on 17 August 2017 she was satisfied that the respondent is mentally incapable becausehesuffers from seniledementia,is not whollycompetent to manage his own affairs in relation to his property, and is mentally incapable, as he lacks the capacity to foresee the consequences of decisions made or foresee the consequences of any failure to make such decisions.  [5] The certificate states that the respondent has a worsening of memory and communication skills.  [6] In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the respondent is under disability and accordingly I make the vesting orders under s 52(1)(b)(i) and the orders sought in respect of the conduct of proceedings are made accordingly.

NOTE: PUBLICATION OF NAME OR IDENTIFYING PARTICULARS OF COMPLAINANT PROHIBITED BY S 139 OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 1985.  IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 99/2013 [2014] NZSC 56   BETWEEN  V (SC 99/2013) Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ and William Young J   Counsel:  Applicant in person B F Windley for Respondent   Judgment:  13 May 2014    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall of the judgment of 26 November 2013 is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] In a judgment delivered on 26 November 2013, the Court refused the applicant leave to appeal against a judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing his appeal against conviction for sexual offending against his daughter.1 The applicant has subsequently submitted lengthy hand-written documents to the Court. These are discursive and cover many topics, most of which lie outside the purview of this Court. It is, however, apparent that the applicant wishes the Court to reconsider the decision to refuse leave to appeal and we propose to treat this as an application to recall the judgment.  V (SC99/2013) v R [2013] NZSC 129.  V (SC 99/2013) v R [2014] NZSC 56[13May2014]  [2] Comparing the material which he has submitted with the judgment of the Court ofAppeal, the issues which he raises were broadlythe same as those which the Court ofAppeal addressed. As noted in the leave judgment, the applicant’s trial was in 2007 but his appeal was not heard until November 2011. The applicant made complaints about his trial counsel and subsequently was represented by four other lawyers each of whom eventually withdrew. He was unrepresented at his appeal.  The records of the Court ofAppeal confirm that he told the Court that he was content to represent himself. In what werethus difficult circumstances, the Court ofAppeal was extremely thorough in identifyingand assessing his various complaints about his trial and the verdicts.   [3] Nothing which the applicant has advanced raises an issue of public or general importance and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice. The application to recall the earlier judgment is dismissed.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent 
IN THE HIGH COURT OFNEWZEALAND PALMERSTON NORTH REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TE PAPAIOEAROHE  CIV-2019-454-6 [2019] NZHC 1340  UNDER section 339(1) of the PropertyLawAct 2007  BETWEEN THE OFFICIALASSIGNEE in bankruptcy in the estate of Russell George Vedder Plaintiff  AND DEBORAHANNEVEDDER Defendant  Hearing: 13 June 2019  Appearances: D Kerr for plaintiff No appearance by or for defendant  Judgment: 13 June 2019    JUDGMENT OFASSOCIATE JUDGE JOHNSTON  [1] In this proceeding the plaintiff, the Official Assignee at Palmerston North, seeks orders pursuant to s 339(1) of the Property Law Act 2007 for the sale of a property formerly owned by Mr Russell and Mrs Deborah Vedder in Horowhenua. MrVedder was adjudicated bankrupt bythis Court on 13 October 2016. Since then the Official Assignee and Mrs Vedder have been the owners of the property.  [2] This proceedingwas commenced in February2019. Alongwith the originating documentation — notice of proceeding and statement of claim — the plaintiff filed and served an application for summaryjudgment and affidavit evidence in support of the same.  [3] The Court has evidence as to service of the proceeding on the defendant.  THE OFFICIALASSIGNEE vVEDDER [2019] NZHC 1340[13June 2019]  [4] The defendant, Mrs Vedder, has not entered a defence or taken any other step in the proceeding.  [5] Accordingly, the proceeding was placed in the Palmerston North commercial list for call today.  [6] Having reviewedthe originatingdocumentation and the other material already referred to, and having considered the matters to which the Court must have regard pursuant to s 442 before making an order under s 339(1), and the affidavit evidence relating to those matters, and having heard Mr Kerr in support, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has established that the defendant has no defence to this claim and that the Official Assignee is entitled to the orders sought.  [7] Accordingly, I enter judgment for the plaintiff in terms of the prayer for relief set out in the statement of claim, togetherwith costs of $14,160.50 and disbursements of $2,172.10.

IN THE HIGH COURT OFNEWZEALAND PALMERSTON NORTH REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TE PAPAIOEAROHE  CIV-2019-454-7 [2019] NZHC 1339   BETWEEN SEMPER FINANCE LIMITED Plaintiff  AND ANDREWTHEODORE DAHL and LISA JAYNE DAHL Defendants  Hearing: 13 June 2019  Counsel: M Dobson for plaintiff First-named defendant in person No appearance by or for second-named defendant  Judgment: 13 June 2019    JUDGMENT OFASSOCIATE JUDGE JOHNSTON  [1] In this proceeding the plaintiff, Semper Finance Ltd, sues the defendants, MrAndrew and Mrs LisaDahl, pursuant to guarantees provided bythem in respect of the indebtedness of a company by the name of Andy Dahl Contracting Ltd. The proceeding was commenced on 7 February 2019. Together with the notice of proceeding and statement of claim, the plaintiff sought summary judgment, filing a notice of application for the same together with supporting affidavit evidence. The originating documentation was served on the defendants – separately – during February 2019. Neither defendant has entered a defence or taken any other formal step in the proceeding.  [2] The basis for the claim is described in the plaintiff’s statement of claim and notice of application, and the evidential foundation for it is set out in the affidavit of Alan McKenzie Larsen who is the plaintiff’s director.  SEMPER FINANCE LIMITED v DAHL[2019] NZHC 1339[13 June 2019]  [3] When this matter was called in the Palmerston North commercial list today, Mr Dahl attended the hearing. Iasked himwhether heaccepted that he and Mrs Dahl had received allrelevantdocumentation,understoodthenatureof the plaintiff’s claim, accepted that the money which the plaintiff alleged it had lent to Andy Dahl Contracting Ltd had in fact been lent, and that he and Mrs Dahl had guaranteed the loans and were liable for them. Mr Dahl accepted all of that. He did say that there had been other litigation between the parties (which I take to be a reference to the proceeding winding up AndyDahl Contracting Ltd) and that he regarded some of the things which the plaintiff had done in the context of that proceedingas havingbeen “a bit shabby”.  [4] Having considered all the material before the court and heard Mr Dobson for the plaintiff, I am satisfied that the plaintiff’s claim is made out and that it has established that the defendants have no viable defence.  [5] Mr Dobson has filed a helpful memorandum setting out the basis upon which the plaintiff has calculated the contractual interest to which it is entitled and costs.  [6] The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment for:  (a)  the principal sum of $397,423.73;   (b)  interest at the contractual rate of 15 per cent per annum (which, as at today’s date, stands at $20,423.73);   (c)  total costs and disbursements of $10,304.50.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date……………  NARESH vNEWZEALAND TRANSPORTAGENCY[2019] NZHC 1279[7 June 2019]  [1] In an interim judgment delivered on21 March 2019, Iheld that as matters then stood Mr Naresh had not identified any question of law for this Court to consider on appeal.1 Asan indulgence IgaveMr Naresh until 9 May2019 to fileand servefurther submissions identifying anyquestions of law heconsiders the Court shoulddetermine.   [2] Mr Naresh has now filed a memorandum and affidavit. In the memorandum he contends I erred in my interim judgment regarding the number of traffic offences, criminal convictionsand documented complaints hehas accumulated. Whetherornot Imadeanyerrorinthat regard is irrelevant to theissueIam nowrequired todetermine.  [3] The error of law Mr Naresh identifies in relation to the Judge’s decision is as follows:  On 7 September 2018 Her Honour Judge AASinclair did give an extra time to the respondent to discuss there [sic] case and made a false and misleading information in her decision regarding a 107 traffic offences 10 criminal conviction and 50 documented complain fromATO  [4] In an affidavit filed on 24 April 2019 Mr Naresh also seeks to raise an alleged error of law in relation to a supplementary affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent which Mr Naresh did not receive prior to the hearing date.  [5] Ido not consider either of theseissues raises an arguable question of law so as to enable Mr Naresh to bring an appeal to this Court.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI PIRA O AOTEAROA  CA725/2017 [2019] NZCA 160  BETWEEN  LOWVOLUME VEHICLE TECHNICAL ASSOCIATION INCORPORATED Appellant   AND  JOHN BERNARD BRETT First Respondent   ANTHONY PETER JOHNSON Second Respondent    Court: Kós P and Clifford J  Counsel: R J Gordon for Appellant and Second Respondent First Respondent in person  Judgment: 15 May 2019 at 3 pm (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  The applicationis declined. No order for costs is made.  REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byKós P)  [1] On 26 March 2019 this Court allowed the appeal and dismissed thecross-appeal.1 A permanent injunction was granted against Mr Brett, and the case was remitted to the High Court for reconsideration of whether qualified privilege was an available defence against the Association’s claim. As to costs, Mr Brett was  Low Volume Vehicle Technical Assoc Inc v Brett [2019] NZCA67.  LOWVOLUMEVEHICLE TECHNICALASSOCIATIONINCORPORATED vBRETT[2019] NZCA160 [15 May2019]  required to pay costs on a standard appeal on a band A basis together with usual disbursements.   [2] Mr Brett has now filed an “interlocutory application” to the effect that the awardof costs be changed so“that costs lie where theyfall”. Thegrounds offered are two. First, that itcannot besaid that the Association was the successful party in the proceedings (orthat Mr Brett was unsuccessful). Secondly, that Mr Brett lacks means to pay costs.    Discussion  [3] The Court has delivered its judgment on the appeal. That judgment has been sealed. This is not an interlocutory application, therefore, and the Court has no jurisdiction toconsider it. Wewillinstead treat itasan application forrecall,forwhich jurisdiction might lie. But we see no basis on which recall could be obtained on the grounds offered, even if the very limited threshold for recall could be met.  [4] Neither premise for revision of the costs order is sustainable.  TheAssociation’s appeal was allowed, a permanent injunction was ordered, and theHigh Courtwasdirected to reconsider its dismissal of part of the claim on the basis of qualified privilege. Mr Brett’s cross-appeal against Mr Johnson was dismissed. It cannot be said in these circumstances that the Court erred in ordering costs against MrBrett. Finally, want of means is not abasis onwhich costs should not be awarded. Even if itwere otherwise, that should have been raised at the hearing, and evidence to that effect produced.  It was not,and has not been.     Result  [5] The application is declined. No further order for costs is made.  Solicitors: Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, Wellington forAppellant and Second Respondent  
Delivered on 15 May 2019 at 1:30 pm pursuant to r11.5(b)  IN THE HIGH COURT OFNEWZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TEWHANGANUI-A-TARAROHE  CIV-2018-485-606488 [2019] NZHC 426  UNDER the TrusteeAct 1956 and the Administration Act 1969  INTHE MATTER of the Estate of Roderick Arthur Wellwood  BETWEEN ROBYN MARIAWELLWOOD, ELINOR LISA MARTELand ANNA KATRINA ASHTON Plaintiffs  AND MICHAELWELLWOOD Defendant  Hearing: On the papers  Counsel: G W D Manktelow for Plaintiffs C JTennet for Defendant  Judgment: 15 May 2019    JUDGMENT OFCOOKE J (Costs)  [1] In my judgment of 12April I confirmed orders relating to the substitution of the Executor of the Estate.1 In the course of that judgment Iconcluded that it was not appropriate to makeacosts award, but Iwas minded to agree that the reasonablecosts of each side should be met out of the assets of the Estate. I further directed that the parties should file memoranda following which Iwould determine the amount, or the proportion of the amount that would be met out of the assets of the Estate.  Wellwood v Wellwood [2019]NZHC 801.  WELLWOOD v WELLWOOD [2019] NZHC 426[15 May2019]  [2] The memorandum from counsel for the plaintiff invites me to reconsider the costs decision Ihave made. It seeks an order ofcosts againstthe defendant, as well as a direction that the plaintiffs’legal expenditure be met out of the assets of the Estate. Thememorandumof counsel forthedefendant opposes anychangeto the costsaward, contends that the parties had effectively resolved that each side would be paid out of the assets of the Estate, and puts forward the defendant’s costs in order that they be directed to be paid out of the assets of the Estate.  [3] I decline to change the costs decision I have already reached. I note that the authority relied upon by counsel for the plaintiff, Hunter v Hunter, itself makes clear that the decision in relation to costs “all depends upon the circumstances of the particular case”.2 I also note that the costs award claimed was calculated on the basis that the proceeding was an ordinaryproceeding, ratherthan an originating application as Idirected in paragraph[8]of thejudgment, and accordinglysubstantiallyoverstates the costs award that would bemade. It also involves claiming an award thatis greater than the costs actuallyincurred, which is not permitted (r 14.2(1)(f) of the High Court Rules 2016).  [4] In terms of the defendant’s legal expenditure totalling $13,922.50, this expenditurestrikesmeas beingreasonable, andIdirect that itbepaid out ofthe assets of the Estate. The plaintiffs’ costs are higher totalling $21,944.56, and I hesitate in ordering that this total amount be paid out of the assets of the Estate, but in the end direct that they can be so in light of the fact that the application has been successful. Obviously if the Estate has already paid for some of these costs the Estate would not be obliged to pay for them again.

The proceeding wascommenced on26 February 2019. Along with the originating documentation — notice of proceeding and statement of claim — the plaintiff filed an application for summary judgment supported by affidavit evidence.  [2] Subsequently, by ex parte application dated 11 March 2019, supported by affidavit evidence, the plaintiff sought an order for substituted service, the defendant apparently having left the country. An order for substituted service was made on 13 March 2019.   [3] The proceeding was listed for call in the Wellington commercial list on 7 May 2019.  KIWIBANK LIMITED v KHIMICH [2019]NZHC 994 [8 May 2019]  [4] On behalf of Kiwibank Mr Gordon sought summary judgment.  [5] There is proof of service on the file in the form of an affidavit sworn by Khoti Rose Walker-Clements dated 18 April 2019.  [6] The defendant has not entered a defence or taken any other step in the proceeding. By default, then, Kiwibank is able to establish the substantive claim.  [7] The Court has before it an affidavit sworn by Vaughan Robert Hewson dated 26 February 2019 which comprehensively supports the basis for, and the quantum of, Kiwibank’s liquidated claim.  [8] As at 15 February 2019, the amount owed to Kiwibank by the company, and therefore by the defendant, under the three loans or “facilities”, together with contractual interest to that date, totals $1,292,982.40.  [9] Kiwibank also seeks an order that contractual interest continue to accrueat the rates provided for in the three loan agreements from the date of judgment, together with scale costs and disbursements.  [10] In my view, Kiwibank is entitled to judgment. I therefore enterjudgment inits favour in the sum of $1,292,982.40. Interest will continue to accrue on the unpaid loans from the date of this judgment until the date of payment at the contractual rates provided for in the three loan agreements (cl 2 of the revolving credit facility; cl 4 of the overdraft facility; and cl 2 of the construction facility). Finally, Kiwibank is entitled to scale costs on a 2B basis together with disbursements which may be fixed by the Registrar.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI PIRA O AOTEAROA  CA N/A [2019] NZCA 142  BETWEEN JANE SIEMER Applicant   AND DISTRICT COURTATNORTH SHORE First Respondent  AND DISPUTESTRIBUNALATNORTH SHORE Second Respondent  Judgment: 7 May 2019 at 11 am (On the papers)    JUDGMENT OFGILBERT J  The application for review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision is declined.  REASONS  [1] Jane Siemer applies for review of a decision of the Deputy Registrar dated 5April 2019 declining to accept for filing a document styled “Application for leave on Human Rights Grounds”. The body of the document clarifies that Mrs Siemer is seeking leave to appeal against a judgment of Downs J delivered on 6 March 2019. 1 The Judge declined Mrs Siemer’s application under s 169(4) of the Senior Courts Act 2016 (the Act) for leave to continue her proceeding seeking judicial review of a decision of theDisputes Tribunal and a decision of theDistrict Court dismissing her  1 Siemer v District Court [2019]NZHC 346.  SIEMER v DISTRICTCOURTATNORTH SHORE [2019] NZCA142[7 May2019]  appeal from the Tribunal’sdecision. Leavetocontinue thejudicial reviewproceeding was required because of a civil restraint order made against Mrs Siemer by Hinton J.  [2] In declining to accept the present application for filing, the Deputy Registrar observedthat under s169(6)of theAct the Judge’s determination ofan application for leave is final.  [3] Mrs Siemer contends the Deputy Registrar was wrong in law in refusing to accept the document forfilingon the grounds therewas noright of appeal. MrsSiemer says the DeputyRegistrar either erred bymisinterpreting the document as anotice of appeal orheincorrectlyapplied the Act “in claimingan application forleave toappeal is prevented by some statutory provision he failed to identify”. Mrs Siemer acknowledges that shehas noright to afirst instanceappeal. However, sheargues that there is “no law” preventing her application for leave to appeal, particularly where theapplication seeks to “overturn alleged unlawful discrimination preventing access by a High Court judge”. This is a reference to Mrs Siemer’s complaint that in thecourse of his decision, the Judge madefindings about Mr Siemer’s conduct in breach of the principles of natural justice. Mrs Siemer says this shows she was thevictim of unlawful discrimination by the Judge.  [4] TheDeputy was plainly correct to reject the document forfiling.  There is no jurisdiction forthis Court to entertain the proposed appeal and no jurisdiction to grant leave to consider it. Section 169(6) of the Act could not be clearer — the Judge’s determination of an application for leave is final.  Result  [5] The application for review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision is declined.

B The approved question is whether the Court of Appeal erred in applying the proviso to s 385(1) of the Crimes Act 1961.    REASONS  [1] Thegrant of leaveislimited to the proviso issue. Leave isdeclined in relation  to the points raised bythe applicant about theabsenceofademeanourdirection bythe  trial Judge and the admission of the IHC evidence.  MARK EDWARD LUNDYv R [2019] NZSC 45 [6 May2019]  [2] In relation to the demeanour direction, there is no matter of general or public importance, this Court having addressed the issue recently.1 We see no appearance of a miscarriage in the way the Court of Appeal addressed the issue in relation to the applicant’s demeanour at the funeral of the deceased.  [3] The applicant did not challenge the Crown’s evidence that there was central nervous system (CNS) tissue on the shirt he wore on the night that the deceased were killed at the trial. Nor did he do so in the pre-trial hearings.2 This was in contrast to the position taken in his appeal to the Judicial Committee of the PrivyCouncil.3 The experts called by the applicant at the trial accepted the Crown position, based on the IHCevidence. Theapplicant’schallengeto thereliabilityandadmissibilityof the IHC evidence was rejected by the Court of Appeal after detailed consideration of the matters raised bythe applicant, which necessarilyimpugned the evidencegiven bythe experts called byhim at the trial. We do not see sufficient prospects of success in the argument that the applicant wishes to ventilate again in this Court to justify a further appeal on this issue.

[2] The application arises out of the executors’ assessment that the estate is insolvent. The principal reason for such insolvency is a claim made on the estate by James Glover and Margaret Sewell relating to non-completion of an agreement for sale and purchase signed bythe deceased shortlybefore her death. TheExecutors do not have the funds to continue the defence of that claim.  [3] Mr Glover and Ms Sewell consent to the orders sought.  [4] Iam satisfied that the case is an appropriate onefor orders pursuant to s 380 of the Insolvency Act 2006.

[2] In my judgment I ordered costs against Ian Roblin on a 2B basis, but I asked Mr O'Neill, counsel for Grant Roblin, to submit a schedule ofthese costs for approval. He has now done so.  [3] Mr O'Neill's schedule of 2B scale costs comes to $26,202.50, together with disbursements of $1,572.00. This struck me as surprisingly high.  [4] Mr O'Neill rightly and responsibly notes that awarded costs may not exceed actual costs.2 The actual costs Grant Roblin has incurred are $15,143.20, plus the disbursements. I accept that those costs would have been reasonably incurred.  [5] I therefore order costs of $15,143.20, plus $1,572.00 in disbursements against Mr Ian Roblin.   Roh/in v Roblin [20JtJJ NZIIC 374.

[2] Hildegard Mednis died in 2011 leaving awillof unknown date and appointing her daughter, Astrid Mednis,as sole executor.  [3] The executor has neglected, or refused, to prove the will or to renounce probate. The will is held by Till Henderson Lawyers (THL). THL, New Plymouth, provided legal services to the deceased.  The respondent is a partner in thefirm.  [4] The Trust holds the ground lease on a number of properties including Windsor Villas at 68 Whiteley Street, New Plymouth. Villa 4 was owned by the deceased. Shedied leaving arrears of rent owing to the Trust. Rex Nathan, oneof the  TE TAHAMAORI PROPERTYTRUST vMANNING[2019] NZHC 884 [18April2019]  trustees of the Te Taha Maori Property Trust deposes to the unpaid land lease rental forthe period December 2007 to 31 May 2018 totalling $37,295. Acharging order was registered bythe Trust on 18October2011. As well, the Trust has paid rates on behalf of the estate of the deceased to the New Plymouth District Council for the period 2013 to 2018, totalling $18,584.12.  [5] Various approaches have been made to Ms Mednis, both by solicitors for the Trust and byTHLseekingto haveMsMednis applyforprobate. Theapproaches have been unsuccessful. The will remains unproved. As a consequence, administration of the estate has not occurred.  [6] In addition to unpaid landlease rental and rates paid onbehalf ofthe deceased, the Trust has incurred, and continues to incur, legal costs and disbursements in attempting to recover the payments.  [7] The Public Trust has consented to be appointed as administrator of the estate.  That is not a matter that arises for immediate attention on this application which is only for an order requiring the will to be produced.  [8] Iam satisfied that the circumstances makeitappropriate forme to exercisethe Court’s jurisdiction under s54 of the Administration Act 1969.  [9] The interlocutory application is granted. An order is made in the following terms:  Within seven working days from the date on which this order is served on Linda Manning, solicitor of New Plymouth,Linda Manningis to produce the original will of the late Hildegard Mednis to the Registrar of the High Court at Wellington.

I make that order accordingly.  I also note the constructive approach taken by the parties to ensure that the arbitration can commence expeditiously as well as the agreement that has been reached on the costs, meaning that any further orders from the Court are not required.

It is by definition a dispute between neighbours. Without further material substantive steps in the proceeding, these neighbours settled matters, except for the question of costs. As duty judge, the parties’ costs memoranda have been put before me.  [2] The applicants seeks 2B costs and disbursements of about $12,000. The respondent says costs should lie where they fall, but otherwise be only of modest proportion.  [3] I have no foundation on which to exercise my discretion by reference to applicable principle.1 Icannot identifywho maybe said to have failed or succeeded; I do not know the complexity or significance of the proceeding; I cannot assess what steps reasonably were required in its prosecution, or what was a reasonable time for each. I am not assisted by counsel’s contentions as to the foundations for the neighbours’ dispute.  [4] In those circumstances, I order costs are to lie where they fall.  —Jagose J  HCR14.2.  
    IN THE             CIV 2019-441-10              UNDER     the Trustee Act 1956          IN THE MATTER OF     an application for vesting order, removal of trustees and appointment of new trustees         BETWEEN     JANICE ANN DUNPHY  Applicant         AND     JOAN MAY BURN and JEAN LETITIA DANN  Respondents        On the papers             Judgment:     11 April 2019           JUDGMENT OF MALLON J [1] This application concerns the Farleigh Blackwell Trust.  The applicant (Janice) is a trustee of the Trust.  The other trustees are the respondents (Joan and Jean).  The Trust owns an orchard and has investments with Forsyth Barr.   [2] The Trust was settled by Douglas Storkey on 1 August 1995.  Mr Storkey is now deceased.  The Trust was set up for Joan.  The primary beneficiaries of the trust are Joan; Joan’s nephews or nieces (John, Gavin, Bryan and Janice); and the children of any of them.  Joan did not have children.  John, Gavin, Bryan and Janice all have children.  Under the Trust deed the power to appoint new trustees vests in Joan.   [3] Joan had a distinguished career with the New Zealand Women’s Royal Army Corps and in 1970 was awarded an MBE by the Queen for her services to the Army.  She is now 95 years old.  She is in a rest home.  A recent medical certificate confirms    she suffers from dementia.  Jean is 90 years old.  She also lives in a rest home and a recent medical certificate confirms that she too suffers from dementia.   [4] Janice applies for an order removing Joan and Jean as trustees and appointing Kevin Barton Osborne (Kevin) and Bryan George Dunphy in their place.1  Kevin is the solicitor for the trust.  Bryan is Janice’s brother, and a primary beneficiary under the trust (as a nephew of Joan).  Janice also applies for an order vesting the orchard property (which is on two certificates of title) in the names of Janice, Bryan and Mr Osborne.2   [5] Kevin and Bryan consent to the orders.  Joan’s other nephews, John and Gavin, consent to the orders.  The children of Bryan, John, Gavin and Janice consent to the orders.  In short, all the primary beneficiaries consent to the orders, as do the new trustees.    [6] I am satisfied it is appropriate to remove Joan and Jean as trustees and to appoint Kevin and Bryan in their place and to vest the properties in the names of Kevin, Bryan and Janice.  The orders sought in the originating without notice application dated 25 March 2019 are accordingly made.   [7] I thank Mr O’Connor, counsel for Janice, for his helpful memorandum and supporting material.    1  Trustee Act 1956, s 51.

I issued a judgment on 15 May 2018. I dismissed Mr Macfarlane’s application for an order sustaining a caveat registered over a property owned by  MACFARLANE v PERPETUALTRUSTLIMITED [2019] NZHC727 [8April 2019]  Perpetual Trust Ltd, ordered that the caveat lapse as sought by Perpetual and entered summary judgment for Perpetual in its proceedings seeking vacant possession of the property. Mr Macfarlane appealed to the Court of Appeal. His appeal was dismissed. Mr Macfarlane then applied for leave to apply to the Supreme Court.  His application was declined.  [2] Now Perpetual seeks costs. It seeks only scale costs on a 2B basis. The governing principles are well settled. As a rule, costs follow the event, that is to say, the successful party is entitled to an award of costs, and the award is determined by reference to the scales contained in the High Court Rules. Thus, prima facie at least, Perpetual is entitled to its costs.  [3] Mr Macfarlane has filed amemorandum in response to Perpetual’s application for a costs order.  He says that the case may not be over.  He says that he is proposing to apply to the Supreme Court to recall its judgment declining him leave to appeal to that Court. Apparently, the basis for this is that Perpetual, through its solicitors, has dealt inappropriatelywith chattels in theproperty. On the basisof the material set out in his memorandum, Iam quite unable to see anyproper foundation foran application for a recall.  [4] Perpetual will have its costs which I fix at $26,537.00 together with disbursements totalling $4,349.46. These are the figures supplied by counsel for Perpetual. Mr Macfarlane does not question them in his memorandum. I have checked the figures against the schedules in the Rules and they appear to me to be correct.

REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byMiller J)  [1] Mr Taylor movesforcosts followingthe judgment of the Supreme Court.1 The Supreme Court directed that any issue as to costs in this Court should be dealt with here.  Attorney-General v Taylor [2018] NZSC 104, [2019]1 NZLR213.  ATTORNEY-GENERALvARTHUR WILLIAMTAYLOR [2019] NZCA86[3April 2019]  [2] We had reasoned, contrary to the view later taken by the Supreme Court, that Mr Taylor lacked standing, but that was not the basis on which he was denied costs.  We were advised that hewas legally aided.2  [3] Mr Ewen now advises that the application is made with the sanction of the Legal Services Commissioner under s 105(b) of the Legal Services Act 2011. That being so, we accept that it is proper to award costs.  [4] There is no dispute as to the appropriate band. Accordingly, the Crown must pay Mr Taylor’s costs for a complex appeal on a band A basis with usual disbursements.

TAO vSTRATATITLE ADMINISTRATION LTD [2019] NZCA79[29 March 2019]   REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byMiller J)  [1] This judgment responds to Ms Tao’s application for extension of time to apply for a hearing date and file a case on appeal under r 43 of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005.  [2] The appeal was brought against a decision of Associate Judge Matthews declining Ms Tao’s application to set aside a bankruptcy notice issued by the respondents. That judgment was delivered on 30April 2018.1 Securityfor costs was payable by 13 August 2018, and the present application was filed on 15 August 2018.  [3] Ms Tao contends that her appeal has merit. In support, she points to grounds which were examined in the decisions below and rejected. The merits do not appear strong.  There is no doubt she has committed an act of bankruptcy.   [4] Ms Tao was adjudicated bankrupt on 29 January 2019. The present appeal is accordinglyrelevant onlyinsofar as, if successful, itwould remove the foundation for the order of adjudication, against which Ms Tao has a separate right of appeal.2  [5] Finally, Ms Tao has not advanced any satisfactory explanation for the long delay in progressing this matter, and she has not paid security for costs despite promising that she would do so some months ago.  She says that she is unable now to pay security for costs, but an application for dispensation or reduction was previously declined on 27 July 2018.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date……………  DAVIS v DEPARTMENTOF CORRECTIONS [2019] NZHC 518 [21 March2019]  [1] Mr Davis is currentlyawaitingtrialin the District Court ontwosets of charges. He is due to appear in the Manukau District Court on one set of charges on 28 March 2019at 11.45 am. Heisscheduled to appear in theWaitakereDistrict Court on2 April 2019 at 10 am in relation to the remaining charges. He now applies for an order of habeas corpus.  [2] Counsel for the respondents has provided the Court with copies of warrants signed by a Community Magistrate on 12 March 2019 and by Judge Roberts on 14March 2019. These are in order, and I am therefore satisfied Mr Davis is currently being lawfullydetained in custody. Theapplication forhabeas corpus thereforecannot succeed, and is dismissed accordingly.  [3] DuringthehearingMr Davis advised methat his real concern lies with the fact that he is currently being housed with convicted prisoners rather than prisoners on remand. He considers this is likely to have occurred because the warrant dated 14 March 2019 notes that Mr Davis has been convicted on charges of shoplifting and failing to answer District Court bail when this is not the case. He wants to be transferred to the remand section of the prison in which he is currently incarcerated.   [4] The Court cannot do anything about Mr Davis’ concerns, but Mr Taylor will no doubt convey them to the respondents. In addition, I direct that a copy of this minute is to be sent to Mr Gavin English, who Mr Davis says is representing him on thecriminal charges. Mr English maywishtocontact Mr Davis and/or the corrections authorities regarding the issue Mr Davis has raised in Court today.  Lang J  Solicitors: Crown Solicitor,Auckland Copy to:  Applicant

[2] Theplaintiff and defendant were parties to an agreement forsale and purchase dated 8 June 2016. The defendant was required to complete the purchase of the propertyon15 October 2018 but failed to do soonthat date orthereafter. Theplaintiff has at all material times been ready, willing and able to comply with its obligation to convey the property to the defendant.  [3] The defendant was served with the proceeding, including the application for summaryjudgment,on26 November2018. Servicewas effected through thelawfirm then actingforthe defendant and authorised to accept service of the proceeding onthe defendant’s behalf. The defendant has taken no steps to defend the proceeding. On that basisthe plaintiff is entitled toproceed withits application forsummaryjudgment.  [4] The material filed in support of the application for summary judgment persuades me that the defendant has no defence. Itherefore enter summaryjudgment as to liability.   [5] It will now be for the plaintiff to determine whether to seek specific performance or to resell the property and recover any shortfall from the defendant.  The plaintiff has leave to file further documents dealing with those issues. If any further steps need to be taken, the proceeding should be listed for mention in a convenient summary judgments list.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date: ………………………….  Solicitors: Gaze Burt, Auckland  WEATHERUP vWEATHERUP[2019] NZHC 476[18March 2019]  [1] The deceased, Lillian Joy Weatherup, died on or about 26 June 2018. An application has been made by the intended executors of a Will dated 9 March 2016, seeking probate in common form. The evidence shows that the deceased was blind at the time of her death and it appears that the Will was not read to her. Rather, one of theexecutors, Ms Lory, explained the Will to her and its terms, namely, that everything would be left to her four children equally. The deceased’s lawyers are holding an earlier Will, dated 18 February 2016. The terms of that will are exactly the same as the Will of 9 March 2016. The reason for the new Will is that the front page of the former Will was not initialled. All of the beneficiaries under both Wills consent to probate being granted.   Assessment  [2] While the failure to read out theWill to the deceased is a material irregularity, given that the Will is a copy effectively of a previous Will which contained only a minor defect, I am satisfied that probate in solemn form should be granted.  [3] There shall be an order accordingly.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors: Crown Solicitor, Auckland.  Copy to:  Second Respondent.  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE v FAKAOSILEA [2019] NZHC 416 [12 March 2019]  [1] The Commissioner of Police, Ms Selaima Fakaosilea, Mr Callan Hughes and Mr Kane McArley ask the Court to approve their settlement under s 95 of the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009.   [2] On 12 June 2016, Police seized 501 kilograms of methamphetamine in Northland.  Police arrested seven people, including Ms Fakaosilea. Police later commenced a second investigation. It led to Mr Hughes’ arrest.  He was a driving a Mercedes (JFD36) and in possession of $57,141.28 cash.    [3] On 13 June 2018, Mr Hughes pleaded guilty to 11 charges of supplying methamphetamine and other offences. Mr Hughes received a sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment, with a minimum period of half that.  Ms Fakaosilea and Mr McArley were also convicted of serious drugs offending.  Ms Fakaosilea was sentenced to 14 and a half years’ imprisonment; Mr McArley 15 years’ imprisonment.   [4] Little property was seized in relation to the defendants beyond that described, a point animating the proposed settlement.  Mr Hughes agrees the cash should be forfeited.  So too the proceeds of the sale of the Mercedes after $1,000 is returned to him.  Mr Hughes abandons all claims he may have under the Act or otherwise, in relation to any restrained property.  Similarly, Mr Hughes acknowledges the Mercedes was held on his behalf even though it was registered in another’s name. In return, the Commissioner agrees to abandon its profit forfeiture action.   [5] I am satisfied settlement is consistent with the Act’s purposes and the overall interests of justice. The outcome is realistic.  [6] I make the orders sought.  …………………………….. Downs J

[2] On 19 November 2018, Winkelmann J issued a direction that Mr Porter must file detailed grounds of appeal no later than Friday14 December 2018.1  Porter v R CA88/2018, 19 November 2018.  PORTER v R [2019] NZCA46[12 March 2019]  [3] Mr Porter failed to comply with that direction and accordingly the Court notified him on 11 February 2019 that unless the detailed grounds of appeal ordered by Winkelmann J were filed within ten working days, his appeal would be dismissed under s 338 of the Criminal ProcedureAct 2011.  [4] No grounds of appeal have been filed. Theappeal is dismissed.  Solicitors: Crown Law Office, Wellington for Respondent

IN THE SUPREME COURT OFNEWZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANA NUI  SC 119/2018 [2019] NZSC 26  BETWEEN  GEORGE WHICHMAN Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent    Court: William Young, Glazebrook and O’Regan JJ Counsel: Applicant in person JA Herring for Respondent Judgment: 11 March 2019   JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  The applicationfor leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant pleaded guilty to four offences involving the infliction of violence on his partner.  The pleas were entered against the background of a sentence indication. However, itbecame apparent that the District Court did not havethe power to sentence the applicant in accordance with the sentence indication and imposed a sentence that was less favourable from the applicant’s point of view.1  R v Whichman [2017] NZDC 28671 (Judge Wharepouri).  GEORGE WHICHMAN v R [2019] NZSC 26[11 March 2019]  [2] The applicant appealed against his convictions on the four charges mentioned above. The Court of Appeal accepted that the applicant’s pleas had been entered on the basisof incorrect legal advice as to the effect ofthe sentence indication.2 This had led to a miscarriage of justice.3 The appeal was allowed and the convictions were quashed.  [3] However, the Court of Appeal made an order remitting the charges to the District Court for the applicant to replead and for trial.4 The applicant seeks leave to appeal to this Court against that aspect of the Court of Appeal’s decision. Hesays the Court ofAppeal should have directed that acquittals be entered on the four charges.  [4] The applicant also raises in his submissions complaints about other aspects of his treatment in the Manukau District Court. However, it is not open to this Court to address these issues in the context of a criminal appeal.  [5] The application seeks leave to bring a criminal appeal. The proposed appeal would be under s 237(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, which allows for a second appeal, with leave, bya“convicted person”. In the present case, theapplicant’s convictionshavebeen set aside so itappears that heis no longer a“convicted person” for the purposes of s 237(1).5 It is not necessary to express a concluded view on that, however, as we do not consider that the criteria for the grant of leave are met in any event.6 Theproposed appeal does not raise anymatter of public importance and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice in the way in which the Court of Appeal addressed the issue.  [6] We therefore decline leave to appeal.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OFNEWZEALAND I TE KOTI MANA NUI  SC 113/2018 [2019] NZSC 21  BETWEEN  SHREESH BASNYAT Applicant   AND  NEW ZEALAND POLICE Respondent    Court: William Young, O’Regan and Ellen France JJ Counsel: C Mitchell forApplicant  K Peirse-O’Byrne for Respondent Judgment: 5 March 2019    JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  The applicationfor leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of driving with an excess proportion of alcohol in his blood, but sought a discharge without conviction. Thiswas refused byJudgeEllis, who entered aconviction, imposed afine of $800, ordered him to paycosts and medical fees, and disqualified himfrom driving for six months.1 He appealed unsuccessfully to the High Court against the refusal to dischargehimwithout conviction2 and later sought the leave of the Court of Appeal to appeal against the High Court judgment. The Court of Appeal dismissed the application for leave to appeal, albeit the Court also addressed the substantive merits of the appeal.3 The applicant now seeks leave to appeal to this Court.  1  New Zealand Police v Basnyat [2017] NZDC 21099.   2  Basnyat v Police [2018] NZHC 51 (Brewer J) [Basnyat (HC)].   3  Basnyat  v  New  Zealand  Police  [2018] NZCA 486 (French, Cooper and Williams JJ)   [Basnyat (CA)].    SHREESH BASNYAT v NEWZEALANDPOLICE [2019] NZSC21 [5 March 2019]  [2] The application for leave to appeal is formally addressed to the Court of Appeal’s decision. This Court, however, has no jurisdiction to hear appeals from a refusal by the Court of Appeal to grant leave to appeal.4 In the circumstances, we propose to address the application as if it sought leave to appeal direct from the High Court judgment. Such anappealis possible, but thegrantingof leaveis subject to s75 of the Senior Courts Act 2016 and requires “exceptional circumstances” to be established.  We note, as well, that the application for leave to appeal was filed out of time. No pointonthis latterissuehavingbeen taken bytheCrown, weproposeto deal with the application on its merits.  [3] The reasons why the applicant sought a discharge without conviction were addressed in considerable detail in the judgments of both the High Court, dismissing his primary appeal, and the Court of Appeal dismissing his application for leave to appeal. Adischarge withoutconviction is not possible unless the court is satisfied that the consequences of a conviction “would be out of all proportion to the gravityof the offence”,5 a test which is unlikely to be met if neither the offending nor the consequences are out of the ordinary (which, broadly, was the assessment of both the High Court and Court of Appeal in respect of this case).6 While there may be scope for debate as to how this should be expressed (for instance by use of the words “extraordinary” or “exceptional”), we do not see this case as raising a question of public or general importance. Noris there any appearance of amiscarriage of justice. And, as well, the s 75 test of “exceptional circumstances” is not satisfied.  [4] Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byGilbert J)  [1] In a judgment delivered on 17 October 2018, we allowed Mr Pratley’s appeal against a judgment of the High Court directing him to bear personally the costs of defending District Court proceedings in his capacity as a trustee and executor. 1 We directed that the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Mr Pratley in this capacitywereto bemet from theassets of theestate. Wealso madean orderrequiring  1 Pratley v Courteney [2018] NZCA436, [2018] NZAR 1787.  PRATLEY vCOURTENEY[2019] NZCA28[1 March 2019]  the first respondent, a beneficiary, to pay costs on the appeal assessed on a band A basis and usual disbursements.   [2] Following delivery of the judgment, a dispute has arisen between the parties about Mr Pratley’s entitlement to access his indemnity for various costs. MrFowler QC filed a memorandum on Mr Pratley’s behalf seeking a direction that the party and party costs order was not intended to displace Mr Pratley’s right of indemnity as a trustee and executor from the assets of the estate. Alternatively, MrFowler seeks an order that the costs order berescinded and replaced with a direction that he is entitled to the benefit of the indemnity.  [3] Mr Morrison for the respondents contends that, although not framed as such, Mr Fowler’smemorandummustbetreatedas an application forrecall and determined in accordance with the well-established principles set out in Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2). 2 Hesubmitsthere is no justification forthe Court to recallits judgment. MrMorrison also advises that the costs dispute extends to amounts claimed that are unrelated to the appeal and include costs incurred after Mr Pratley ceased to be an executor. Mr Morrison cautions that the Court should refrain from making any comment or direction that might restrict the respondents’ ability to advance their position in the dispute.  [4] We accept Mr Morrison’s submissions. We consider the clarification MrPratleyseeks would requiretheCourt to recall the judgment. In our view, there is no justification for the judgment to be recalled.   Result  [5] The application for recall is declined.

Solicitors: Law &Associates, Manukau City Dawsons, East Tamaki for the First andThird Defendants  Counsel: RS Pidgeon, Mairangi Bay,Aucklandfor the First andThirdDefendants  LIU vXIE [2019] NZHC 288 [28February2019]  [1] On 18 December 2018, I gave judgment dismissing the plaintiff’s claim and the first and second defendants’ counterclaim.  I directed that costs were payable on a 2Bbasisbythe plaintiff to the first and third defendants. Ialso directed thatif counsel was unable to agree on quantum, memoranda were to be filed.  [2] Thefirst and third defendants have now filed amemorandum seeking an order that fees of $38,579 and disbursements of $43,657.67 are payable by the plaintiffs to them.  [3] Counsel forthe plaintiff takes no issue with the approach taken bythe first and third defendants, but queries an invoice for $15,985 from Mr Matthew Kemp, an expert accountancywitness forthe plaintiff. Counsel says that the amount claimed by Mr Kemp is considerably higher than expected given the rather limited scope of evidence and there is no breakdown of the costs in the invoice supplied.  [4] Mr Kemp has responded by letter dated 1 February 2019, which attaches his time sheet. Mr Kemp’s response discloses that his hourly charge out rate was $395 plus GST and itemises the financial analysis he undertook of the four companies at issue (with three different effective valuation dates) and to assess the plaintiff’s claimed losses.  [5] I am satisfied that Mr Kemp’s charge out rate is reasonable as is the time he expended on his financial analysis.  [6] There will accordingly be an order that the plaintiff pay the first and third defendants the sum of $38,579 plus disbursements of $43,657.67, totalling $82,236.67.  Woolford J

SALTBURN HOLDINGS LTD v PENROSE LEASEHOLD LTD [2019] NZHC 252 [26 February 2019]  [1] Penrose Leasehold Ltd successfully resisted an application by Saltburn Holdings Ltd for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal.  Penrose seeks 2B costs of $5,575. Saltburn acknowledges Penrose should have costs, but disputes the amount sought.  It contends after “taking a step back”, this should be confined to $2,230.  [2] The correct position lies somewhere in between: $3,345. This figure acknowledges the time it took Penrose to prepare its written submissions.  The balance sought—$2,230—was for steps largely duplicating this one.   [3] So, Penrose has 2B costs of $3,345.  …………………………….. Downs J

[2] In that judgment, I made an order for costs in favour ofthe plaintiff and against the first and second defendants, in the sum of $22,634.50.  [3] I did not deal with disbursements. I overlooked doing so.  [4] The issue of disbursements had been raised in a memorandum filed by counsel for the plaintiff. He recorded in para [ 4] of that memorandum -that the plaintiff had incuned disbursements of $3,200 -being the setting down fee of $1,600 and a hearing fee of $1,600. Counsel for the plaintiff seeks an amendment to the costs order.  [5] The memorandum has been forwarded to both defendants. They have not filed any response to the same.  [6] I do not see that an amendment to the earlier costs order is required. Rather, my earlier judgment did not deal with disbursements. In my view, it is open to me now to issue a supplemental judgment, dealing with the issue of disbursements.  [7] There is no challenge to the quantum of the disbursements claimed by the plaintiff, and counsel for the plaintiff has confomed that the disbursements were paid by his client.  [8] Accordingly, I make an order against the first and second defendants jointly, directing them to pay the disbursements incuned by the plaintiff in the sum of $3,200.  Wylie J

REASONS  [1] This is an application to review the Registrar’s decision torefusetogrant afee waiver.  Theapplication relates to a r 43 application for an extension of time.  CLEMENTS vTHE QUEEN OF ENGLAND[2019] NZCA12[18 February2019]  [2] Ms Clements applied for a waiver of fees for her r 43 application and this was declined by a decision of the Registrar on 18 January 2019 in accordance with the Court of Appeal Fees Regulations 2001, reg5(2). Ms Clements now seeks areview of thisdecision and has filed a supplementary argument.   [3] The Registrar may waive the fee payable if it is satisfied that either of the two limbs under reg 5(2) is met. Ms Clements’ application concerns the second limb, which requires that the proceeding concern a matter of genuine public interest and is unlikely to be commenced or continued unless the fee is waived.1 The Registrar was notsatisfied that thecriteriaweremetas Ms Clements indicated inherapplication that shewas likelyto commenceorcontinuetheproceedingregardless ofthe waiverbeing declined. Nothing in hersupplementary argument changes this position.  [4] Ms Clements’application, as noted bythe Registrar, mustalso failonthe other requirement of reg 5(2)(b). The issues raised in the appeal are notionally of public interest, however, for the various reasons set out in the strike-out judgment which is the subject of the appeal, difficulties arise such that any public interest value is diminished.2 Orders are sought that theCourt cannot make. Theclaim is difficult to understand and does not clearly identify decisions that are challenged. There is no clear cause of action pleaded and no valid grounds for judicial review have been put forward. As observed in French J’s decision reviewing Ms Clements’ earlier applications, the appeal would beconcerned withthesespecificproceduralissues, not the broader public implications.3  [5] Theapplication forreview of the Registrar’sdecision refusingto grant awaiver of fees is therefore declined.   1 Court ofAppeal Fees Regulations 2001, reg 5(2)(b). 2 Clements v Queen of England [2018] NZHC 2244 at [25]–[34]. 3 Clements v Queen of England [2018] NZCA581 at [10].

Registrar / Deputy Registrar  Solicitors:  HeskethHenry,Auckland (plaintiff) Chapman Tripp,Auckland (defendant)  JASANI vVINCENTCAPITALLTD [2019] NZHC 146[13February2019]  [1] Myjudgment of17 December2018 dismissed the plaintiff’s urgent application for interim relief, and reserved costs in favour of the defendant.  [2] Thedefendant nowseeks indemnitycostsand disbursements in terms ofclause  14.1of its FacilityLoanAgreementwith the plaintiff, dated 26 June2018. Theplaintiff agrees that is the defendant’s entitlement,1 but disputes the costs claimed are reasonable “having regard for to the rates charged,the overallfee sought, and the lack of detail provided in respect ofsomeof the costs claimed”. In particular dispute is the reasonableness of the defendant’s solicitors’ charging and work practices.  [3] As discussed without objection from counsel at the outset of the application’s substantive hearing, until relatively recently, I was a long-standing litigation partner in the defendant’s solicitors’firm, Chapman Tripp. Although that presented no issue for my determination of the application, in deciding costs, I cannot disregard my comprehensions of the firm’s chargingand work practices. That makes itinappropriate for me to decide the disputes raised.  [4] Given the parties’ agreement, I therefore will order the plaintiff to pay the defendant indemnity costs, being “the actual costs, disbursements and witness expenses reasonably incurred” by the defendant,2 but make provision for the quantification of such to be determined bythe Registrar in accordance with Subpart 2 of Part 14 of the High Court Rules. Such determination is then subject to review.3  [5] I order the defendant is entitled to indemnity costs as taxed.  —Jagose J  1 HCR14.6(4)(e). 2 HCR14.6(1)(b). 3 HCR14.23.

A Wells  Deputy Registrar High Court   KUMAR v NEW ZEALAND POLICE [2019) NZHC 49 [ I February 2019)  [I] Mr Kumar seeks leave to appeal against a pre-trial ruling delivered by Judge Glubb in the District Court at Waitakere on 3 October 2018. 1 In that ruling the Judge held photographic identification evidence to be admissible at Mr Kumar's forthcoming Judge alone trial in the District Court on a charge ofdriving with excess breath alcohol.  [2] For reasons that are presently unknown, the Judge elected to deal with the pre-trial argument on the basis of the papers and without conducting an oral hearing. It is now common ground that the police officer who undertook the identification in question ought to have been called as a witness so that counsel for Mr Kumar could cross-examine him in relation to issues relevant to the issue of admissibility. For that reason both counsel accept that the process adopted by the District Court was in error and should now be revisited. The issue is whether this Court should determine the issue of admissibility on the basis of oral evidence to be called when the appeal is heard, or whether the issue should be remitted to the District Court for re­determination in that forum.  [3] Mr Kumar's trial is due to commence on 1 April 2019. For that reason I consider it appropriate to remit the issue to the District Court for re-determination either prior to trial or during the trial itself. This will enable the District Court to ensure that the current trial date is maintained.  [4] Leave to appeal is granted by consent and the appeal is allowed. The Judge's determination in relation to the admissibility of the evidence is set aside.  [5] It will now be for the District Comt to re-determine the issue of admissibility either prior to the commencement of the trial or during the course of the trial.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date……………  B v CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS [2019] NZHC 6 [11 January 2019]  [1] Mr B is currently serving a sentence of three years three months imprisonment imposed in the Auckland District Court on 16 January 2018 following his conviction on four charges of assault with a weapon. Mr B now applies for a writ of habeas corpus so that he can be released from prison.  [2] Counsel for the respondent has provided me with a copy of the warrant of commitment signed byJudge Field on 16 January2018. Thewarrant appears to bein order, and there is no reason to consider it may be invalid.  [3] Mr B has endeavoured to persuade me that he has substantive grounds to appeal against his conviction, but those issues will need to await the hearing of Mr B’s appeal in the Court of Appeal in March 2019. As I endeavoured to explain to Mr B during the hearing, I cannot go behind a valid warrant of commitment.  [4] I note that Mr B applied to the Court of Appeal for a grant of bail, but this was declined on 28 September 2018.1  [5] Mr B has also endeavoured to raise issues he is encountering in preparing for his appeal. This Court has no jurisdiction to become involved in the appeal process. Any issues Mr B wishes to raise regarding his preparation for the appeal will need to be raised with the Court ofAppeal.

I have received memoranda from counsel for both the first and second defendants.  They do not dispute the plaintiff’s costs calculation and have advised that they are taking steps to pay their respective half shares of the costs and disbursements sought.  [3] Accordingly, I make an order for costs in favour of the plaintiff, and against the first and second defendants, in the sum of $22,634.50.  The costs award is joint and several, although I do not imagine that that will cause any difficulties in the present case.

REASONS  [1] Mr Reuben applies forleaveto appeal againstconviction. Theapplicationwas dueto beheard on 28 November2018 but MrReuben sought and was granted an adjournment to allow him to file late submissions. No further hearing date has been set. Meanwhile the sentenceimposed byJudgeConnellin the District Courtin relation to the conviction (two counts of contravention of a protection order and one count of unlawful conversion of a motor vehicle) has long since been served (although theapplicant may still be subject to release conditions in respect of other offending not related to the current application for leave).1 This was addressed by Toogood J when the matter came before him on first appeal.2  1 Police v Reuben [2017] NZDC 25565. 2 Reuben v Police [2018] NZHC 1870 at [1].  REUBEN vPOLICE [2018] NZCA577[13 December 2018]  [2] Mr Reuben has now applied for suspension of his sentence pending final determination of his appeal.  This application maybe dealt with by a single judge.3  [3] Given the background to this matter there is no basis upon which such application could begranted. Thereis no longer a sentenceto suspend. Therelevant sentence is spent and delay in dealing with the matter has been the result of MrReuben’sown desire that hearingbedelayed. All that remains is the question of whether the conviction should be upheld.   Result  [4] The application to suspend sentence is declined accordingly.

     IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  PALMERSTON NORTH REGISTRY    I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA  TE PAPAIOEA ROHE     CIV 2018-454-114   [2018] NZHC 3230             UNDER     the Trustee Act 1956          AND    IN THE MATTER OF         an application to remove and appoint a Trustee pursuant to s 51 of the Trustee Act 1956         BY     DENISE MARGARET BRUNSKILL  Applicant        On the papers             Judgment:     10 December 2018           JUDGMENT OF MALLON J   [1] The applicant, Denise Brunskill, applies to be appointed as trustee of the trust created under the will of Jean Russell, in substitution of the current trustee, Aileen Burr.  Denise is the daughter of Aileen and the granddaughter of Jean.  The application is made because Aileen, who is in her mid-nineties has lost capacity.  Denise is Aileen’s attorney pursuant to an enduring power of attorney for property.   [2] Jean died in 1974.  She had four children.  Under her will Jean’s estate was to be divided equally amongst those children who survived her, subject to a life interest granted to one of her children which is now at an end.  Jean appointed two of her children to be executors and trustees under her will.  The sole surviving trustee is Aileen.      [3] Jean’s estate is now entirely made up of cash.  The estate cannot be distributed because Aileen has lost the capacity to do so.  Distribution of Jean’s estate to Jean’s now deceased children’s estates needs to occur before those estates can be wound up.   [4] I am satisfied the application should be granted under s 51(1) of the Trustee Act 1956.  The evidence filed supports the application.  The distributions under Jean’s estate are non-contentious.  There is no discretion conferred on the trustee about this.  Denise is an appropriate person to replace Aileen, as her daughter and attorney.     [5] I also grant the associated without notice application for permission to commence the proceeding by originating application.     Mallon J  
IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND   I TE KOTI PIRA O AOTEAROA  CA165/2017 [2018] NZCA 569   BETWEEN  S H Appellant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Hearing:  4 September 2018   Court:  Brown, Duffy and Peters JJ   Counsel:  Appellant in person J E Mildenhall for Respondent   Judgment:  7 December 2018 at 11.00 am    JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  A The appeal is allowed.   B The appellant’s conviction in relation to CRN 15043002075 under s 19(2)(b) of the Domestic Violence Act 1995 is quashed.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Brown J)  [1] Mr H appealed against his conviction for contravention of s 19(2)(b) of the Domestic Violence Act 1995 by contravening a protection order in following a protected person, his former wife.1  Domestic ViolenceAct 1995, ss 19(2)(b) and 49(1).  H v R [2018] NZCA 569 [7 December 2018]  [2] In a memorandum of 5 December 2018 Ms Wong for the Crown advises that it appears that all parties proceeded under the misapprehension that there was a protection order in place in respect of Mrs H when in fact the order applied only to her children. Accordingly the Crown accepts that the prosecution against Mr H is a nullity and his conviction cannot stand.  [3] Accordingly Mr H’s appeal against his conviction is allowed.His conviction is quashed.  Solicitors: Crown Law Office, Wellington for Respondent 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OFNEWZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANA NUI  SC 87/2018 [2018] NZSC 120  BETWEEN  ROBT JONES HOLDINGS LIMITED Applicant   AND  ANTHONY JOHN McCULLAGHAND STEPHEN MARK LAWRENCE Respondents    Court: Glazebrook, O’Regan and Ellen France JJ Counsel: D G Chesterman for Applicant  B P Keene QC and L M Van for Respondents Judgment: 6 December 2018   JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  A Leave to appeal is granted (Robt Jones Holdings Ltd v McCullagh [2018] NZCA 358).  B The approved question is whether the payments totalling $262,758.05 made to theapplicant by MSH No 2 Pty Ltd on behalf of Northern Crest Investments Ltd were insolvent transactions as definedin s 292 of the Companies Act 1993.  REASONS  [1] The approved question is worded to provide a framework for the applicant’s argument that a payment of the company will not be an insolvent transaction within s 292 of the Companies Act 1993 unless, in addition to the requirements of s 292(2), it diminishes the assets that would be available to creditors in the liquidation of the company or otherwise disadvantages the general body of creditors.  ROBTJONES HOLDINGS LIMITED vMcCULLAGH [2018] NZSC 120 [6 December 2018]  [2] TheCourt of Appeal indicated that itwould be content to find that the basis on which MSH No 2 Pty Ltd (MSH) made the payments to the applicant on behalf of Northern Crest Investments Ltd (Northern Crest) was that the payments were either a loan or the redirection of licence fees payable to Northern Crest.1 If the applicant’s argument outlined at [1] aboveis upheld, itmaybecome necessaryto resolvethe issue of whether the payments were a loan or a redirection of licence fees. If the payments were aloan, it appears that the assets available to creditors of Northern Crest werenot diminished and the general body of creditors were not disadvantaged, but that would not appear to be the case if the payments were a redirection of licence fees payable to Northern Crest.   [3] The parties should address in their submissions on the appeal whether it will benecessaryto resolve thebasisonwhich the payments byMSH to the applicant were made if the applicant’s argument outlined at [1] above succeeds and, if so, how the Court should resolve it. Submissions should address whether, if the issue requires resolution, this Court should deal with the issue itself or the case should be remitted to the Court ofAppeal for that Court to deal with it.

REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byWhata J)  [1] Mr Pukepuke’s dog, Biggie, got loose and injured two sheep. Mr Pukepuke applied for discharge without conviction on one charge of owning a dog which attacked stock.1 His application was declined.2 An order was made for Biggie’s destruction.  Mr Pukepuke appealed the destruction order.  The High Court dismissed this appeal.3 Mr Pukepuke now seeks leave to appeal:  1  Dog Control Act 1996, s 57.   2  Auckland Council v Pukepuke [2018] NZDC 6900.   3  Pukepuke v Auckland Council [2018] NZHC 1361.    PUKEPUKE vAUCKLAND COUNCIL[2018] NZCA552 [4 December 2018]  (a)  the decision of the District Court refusing to discharge him without conviction; and   (b)  the High Court decision upholding the destruction order.    [2] There being no jurisdiction in this Court to hear the appeal on the discharge application directlyfrom the District Court, and there being no prospect of success on a second appeal against the destruction order without the discharge, leave is declined.  [3] What about Biggie? He can rest easy for now. Mr Samuel has undertaken to commence an application in the High Court for an extension of time within which to appeal the decision to dismiss the discharge application. Mr Govind will recommend to the Councilthat itdoes not execute thedestruction order pendingthehearingofthe extension application, provided it is filed within the next 14 days. He says it is most likely the Council will follow that advice.  We are grateful for that indication.

[2] Following an attendance on Ms Blocker, ARL Lawyers, Lower Hutt drafted her a will on 31 May2018 and amended it on 14 June 2018 but did not send it to the deceased until 20 June 2018.  [3] There are minor differences between the will draft by ARL and a previous handwritten will made bythe deceased.  They are not material.

RE ESTATE OF ROBYN FAYE BLOCKER [2018] NZHC3177, 4 December 2018  [5] In my view, the evidence of Ms Hopkinson of ARL Lawyers into such the instructions for the will establishes that it was prepared before Ms Blocker’s death on 18 June 2018. However, even if it was prepared after her death, I am satisfied that it should be validated as it accurately reflects the will maker’s intention.1  Grice J  Solicitors: ARLLawyers, Lower Hutt  Pfander v Gregory [2018]NZHC161 at [34] and Re Estate of Capstick [2018NZHC359 at [31].

IN THE SUPREME COURT OFNEWZEALAND I TE KOTI MANA NUI  SC 89/2018 [2018] NZSC 111  BETWEEN  KARLTEANGIOTAU NUKU Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent    Court: William Young, O’Regan and Ellen France JJ Counsel: Applicant in person R K Thomson for Respondent Judgment: 20 November 2018    JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  The applicationfor leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant was tried jointly with Mikhail Pandey-Johnson on charges of aggravated robbery and unlawful possession of firearms. They were found guilty by ajuryin the District Court on both charges. Theapplicant’s appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed bythe Court of Appeal in a judgment delivered on 6 May 2016.1 In October this year and thus well out of time, he applied for leave to appeal to this Court in respect of his conviction and sought an extension of time to do so.  [2] Thereasons advanced bywayof explanation forthedelayinapplyingforleave to appeal primarily involve the applicant’s involvement in other litigation including:  Nuku v R [2016]NZCA179 (Winkelmann, Peters and Collins JJ).  KARLTEANGIOTAU NUKU v R [2018] NZSC 111[20November 2018]  (a)  challenging in other ways the results arrived at in the Courts below – an application to the Court of Appeal to recall its judgment and then judicial review proceedings essentially by way of collateral challenge of the convictions which resulted in judgments from the High Court,2 the Court of Appeal3 and this Court (which dismissed first an application for leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal decision4 and secondly a recall application in respect of that judgment5); and   (b)  aclaim associated with the conduct of apoliceofficer and prison officer involved generally with the case.    [3] The applicant’s explanation for the delay is not compelling; all the more so given that, as this Court pointed out, there was scope for the view the judicial review proceedings were an abuse ofprocess.6 Ifhewished to challenge the Court of Appeal decision, he should have applied to this Court for leave to appeal in a timely way. In those circumstances we decline the extension of time which he has sought.  [4] In deciding not to grant an extension of time, we have had regard to the proposed grounds of appeal raised by the applicant. Each of the points he wishes to argue was fully addressed by the Court of Appeal and we see no appearance of error in that Court’s analysis. Nor does the case raise any question of public or general importance.  [5] Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANANUI  SC 84/2018 [2018] NZSC 108   BETWEEN  PETER RICHARD PRESCOTT Applicant   AND  DISTRICT COURT AT NORTH SHORE First Respondent   MALCOLM DENMEAD Second Respondent    Court: William Young, O’Regan and Ellen France JJ Counsel: Applicant in person N A Speir for Second Respondent Judgment: 19 November 2018  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.   B  The applicant is to pay  costs  of $2,500 to the second   respondent.    REASONS  [1] Mr Prescott seeks leave to appeal against a decision of Clifford J declining his application for review of the decision of Deputy Registrar McGrath to dispense with security for costs.1  [2] The application for leave to appeal has its genesis in an attempt, in mid-December 2016, by Mr Prescott to commence a private prosecution against the  Prescott v District Court at North Shore [2018] NZCA 385.  PETER RICHARD PRESCOTT v DISTRICT COURT AT NORTH SHORE [2018] NZSC 108 [19 November 2018]  second respondent, Mr Denmead.2 Mr Denmead was one of two Auckland Council officers involved in an incident arising out of inquiries into an alleged breach of Council bylaws. The charging documents were rejected for filing by Judge Down in the District Court.3 Mr Prescott, who is self-represented, successfully sought judicial review of that decision and Paul Davison J remitted the private prosecution documentation to the District Court for reconsideration.4 The Judge subsequently declined to award costs to Mr Prescott.5  [3] Mr Prescott has appealed that decision to the Court of Appeal.  Security for costs was set on the appeal at $6,600 and Mr Prescott applied for dispensation under r 35(6)(c) of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005.  The Deputy Registrar declined to dispense with security for costs and Clifford J declined to review that decision.  [4] The focus of Mr Prescott’s submissions is on the merits of his substantive appeal against the decision not to award him costs in the High Court as a self-represented litigant.  Mr Prescott does not seek to challenge the principles applied by Clifford J in declining to review the Deputy Registrar’s decision.  Those principles were set out in Reekie v Attorney-General and were applied by Clifford J in the present case.6 No question of general or public importance accordingly arises out of the approach to the application for dispensation and there likewise is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.7  [5] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  [6] The applicant is to pay costs of $2,500 to the second respondent.

     IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  MASTERTON REGISTRY    I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA  WHAKAORIORI ROHE     CRI 2018-035-176   [2018] NZHC 2978             BETWEEN     ADAM GERRITSON            AND     NEW ZEALAND POLICE  Respondent        Hearing:     16 November 2018       Appearances:     R M Lithgow QC for Appellant S C Carter for Respondent      Judgment:     16 November 2018           ORAL JUDGMENT OF MALLON J [1] Mr Gerritson was convicted on a charge of injuring with intent to injure following a defended hearing before Judge Hobbs in the District Court.1  He was sentenced to eight months home detention and 120 hours community work on 23 August 2018.     [2] On 19 September 2018 he filed an appeal to this Court.  A date for hearing that appeal of 6 December 2018 was offered by this Court.  A difficulty has arisen because a transcript of the hearing is not yet available.  Mr Gerritson’s counsel considers he will not be in a position to advance the appeal on 6 December 2018 because of the delay with the transcript.  He therefore seeks an adjournment of the appeal to a date after the Christmas vacation.    1  Police v Gerritson [2018] NZDC 11915.  [3] The Court can accommodate that and it is not opposed by the Crown, but it will mean that Mr Gerritson will have all but completed his home detention sentence by that date.  Unlike community work, a sentence of home detention is not automatically suspended when an appeal is filed.     [4] It is the appeal court which has jurisdiction to suspend a home detention sentence but it is the trial court which has jurisdiction to grant Mr Gerritson bail.2  I have no difficulty with suspending the sentence in the circumstances, but that should not occur unless and until bail is considered.  As the Court of Appeal said in Din v R, following the commencement of the Administration of Community Sentences and Orders Act 2013, a person serving a home detention sentence is required to apply under s 55 of the Bail Act 2000 for a grant of bail.3   [5] I therefore make an order suspending Mr Gerritson’s home detention sentence conditional on Mr Gerritson being granted bail in the District Court.  The suspension will take effect if and when bail is granted.  The appeal hearing is now set for 5 March 2019.    2  Criminal Procedure Act 2011, s 343(a); Bail Act 2000, ss 54 and 58(2); see Simon France (ed) Adams on Criminal Law – Procedure (looseleaf ed, Thomson Reuters) at [343.02].  3  Din v R [2013] NZCA 610 at [6].

I indicated that in the event that agreement could not be reached I would determine the issue of costs following the filing of memoranda.   [2] In the event the Commissioner has filed a memorandum quantifying costs but has not been able to obtain agreement from the applicant, nor has the applicant taken any steps to oppose the costs sought.  In the circumstances I confirm that the amounts sought by the Commissioner are entirely reasonable and order accordingly.  Decision  [3] The applicant is to pay the Commissioner costs in the sum of $9,700.50 together with disbursements in the sum of $828.47, a total of $10,528.97.   Powell J

Her last will was dated 22 December 2016. It has been discovered there was a clerical error in that the second page of the will had been taken out of her husband’s will. It appears from the affidavit of Mrs Kellaway, who prepared thewilland was present at its execution, that the mistake occurred when administrative staff put the will together before it was executed.

The application was made because Mr O has recently been selected for a national sports team and because Ms Coster wishes to fully understand the basis of my suppression orders.   [2] I sought submissions from counsel for Mr O and Mr D.  They both opposed the application by Ms Coster, primarily on the basis that the application was merely a veiled attempt to determine whether or not there would be grounds for appealing my suppression judgments.   [3] As intimated in my minute of 1 November 2018, I will grant Ms Coster’s application for the following reasons:    (1) My reasons for suppressing publication of the names and identifying features of Mr O and Mr D were made available to the media at the time those decisions were delivered.  (2) Ms Coster is aware that nothing may be published that breaches the suppression orders.  (3) It is appropriate the Court’s reasons for the suppression orders be properly understood by Ms Coster.    [4] Accordingly, my reasons for granting suppression to Mr O and Mr D may be made available to Ms Coster.        _____________________  D B Collins J    Solicitors:  Crown Solicitor, New Plymouth  
     IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  NELSON REGISTRY    I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA  WHAKATU ROHE     CRI-2018-042-758   [2018] NZHC 2913           THE QUEEN         v         BIN JIANG          Hearing     9 November 2018       Counsel:     J M Webber for Crown A J D Bamford and E J Riddell for the Defendant       Oral Judgment:     9 November 2018           ORAL JUDGMENT OF CHURCHMAN J (ADMISSIBILITY) [1] This case involves a hearsay application made by the Crown.  What was sought was an order that statements made by the deceased were admissible at the trial of the defendant, Mr Bin Jiang.  These statements related to two broadly different areas: (a) the first area involved voice recordings made on a system known as WeChat which is apparently a messaging app that is popular in China.  There were messages between the deceased and her brother; and    (b) the second issue related to alleged hearsay statements in the draft brief of evidence of the son of the deceased and the defendant, Mike Jiang.       [2] In memoranda filed prior to this hearing, both the Crown and the defendant had modified their respective positions indicating that some matters that were initially proposed to be covered by the Crown, and some matters that the defence initially took objection to were no longer an issue.   [3] In the course of oral argument this morning, it now appears that there has been substantial agreement to the extent that no formal ruling on admissibility is required other than in respect of one point.  This relates to [19] in the draft brief of evidence of Mike Jiang, and in particular the defence’s concern was that if the evidence portrayed a pattern of complaints by the deceased about actions of the defendant that would be unfair.  But Mr Bamford, for the defendant, conceded that with the exclusion of [19], the material presently set out in draft paragraphs [22] and [23] would be suitable.  Mr Webber has indicated that Crown is likely to modify its position accordingly.  I simply record that but do not make any direction that Mr Webber do that given his indication that is proposed to happen.    Outcome  [4] On the basis of the modification by the Crown of its position, the defence withdraws its objection to the admissibility of the proposed evidence and it is accordingly ruled admissible.   [5] On a separate topic, the issue of an interpreter has been canvassed for various valid reasons.  Mr Bamford is not in a position to express a concluded view but it seems that at least possible that a German speaking interpreter may be required and that is likely to be particularly so should ultimately the defendant elect to give evidence.  As soon as the defence is in a position to advise on the issue of an interpreter, the Registry official should be alerted accordingly.

[2] I am allowing this appeal.  The sentence of 11 months’ imprisonment is quashed and in substitution, six months’ imprisonment is imposed, with two special release conditions attaching, for a period of six months after the sentence expiry date, namely: (a) Mr Thornicroft is to attend and complete an appropriate alcohol and drug counselling/programme/treatment including residential rehabilitation to the satisfaction of a probation officer.  The specific   details of the appropriate programme shall be determined by his probation officer.   (b) Mr Thornicroft is to attend an assessment for a departmental psychologist as directed by a probation officer.  To attend and complete any counselling, treatment or programme as recommended by the assessment as directed by and to the satisfaction of his probation officer.       [3] On your instructions, as I understand it, Ms Grant, Mr Thornicroft has served three and a half months’ imprisonment.  He is therefore due for release on a six month sentence, and the special release conditions will attach to that sentence.

SG vDSG[2018] NZHC 2859[6November 2018]  [1] In mydecision of27 August2018, Idismissed Mr G’s application for an order dismissing this proceeding on forum non conveniens grounds.  I invited theparties to address the issue of costs by memoranda, which they have done.  [2] The plaintiff seeks costs on a 2B basis, which she calculates at $8,472. The defendant accepts that, in the usual course, costs on a 2B basis would be appropriate. However, counsel invitesme to reducethecostsonthe basisthat the proceedings could have been brought more inexpensivelyin the FamilyCourt, where the daily recovery rate for a 2B case is much less. I decline to do so. The question of which court was most appropriate was considered earlier in this proceeding. In his minute of 24 May 2018, Lang J recorded that he had raised the issue with counsel and had been advised by the plaintiff’s counsel, Ms Twentyman, that, on her research, the High Court has been the usual forum for cases involving disputes over children residing overseas.  Lang J did not record any opposition to that assertion from the defendant’s counsel.  I accept that the proceeding has been properly brought in this Court and that 2B costs on the High Court scale are appropriate.  P Courtney J

IN THE HIGH COURT OFNEWZEALAND WHANGANUI REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA WHANGANUI ROHE  CIV-2017-483-12 [2018] NZHC 2877   BETWEEN RERE RAIMA SUTHERLAND Plaintiff  AND ERUERATE KAHUWAITAI Defendant  Counsel: J B Gilbert for plaintiff Defendant in person  Judgment: 6 November 2018    JUDGMENT OFASSOCIATE JUDGE JOHNSTON [On the papers]  [1] This proceeding involves a dispute between two trustees of a family trust. In that capacity, they are the owners of an undivided half share in several blocks of land (the Waipu land).  A judicial settlement conference was convened on 27 June 2018. At the conclusion of that conferencethe parties executed asettlement agreement which provided in effect that theywould accept an offer to purchasethe Waipu land madeby the owner of the other undivided half share, a Mr Douglas Duncan, unless the defendant was able, by 31 August 2018, to secure a more attractive offer.  [2] Thecasewas called again on12 September 2018,as at whichdate Mr Duncan’s offer remained the only one on the table.  [3] The plaintiff sought confirmation that the trustees were to accept that offer. The defendant asked for more time. I indicated that I did not regard the Court as having jurisdiction to extend the time agreed by the parties in their settlement agreement, and directed that the trustees sell the land to Mr Duncan for $1,875,000, a  SUTHERLAND vWAITAI [2018] NZHC 2877[6 November 2018]  figure thathad in fact increased marginallysince27 June2018. Iconfirmed that in a minute issued later that day.   [4] In that minute, I also recorded that there was a suggestion that the defendant might be reluctant to sign the necessary documentation (the contract and related conveyancing documentation), and I gave the plaintiff leave to apply in this proceeding for an order pursuant to pt 5 of the TrusteeAct 1956 dispensing with the need for the defendant to sign that documentation if that became necessary.  [5] By memorandum dated 26 October 2018 Mr Waugh for the plaintiff seeks a formal order in terms of the settlement agreement.  Healso seeks an order pursuant to pt 5 of theAct in the following terms:  This Court, being satisfied that it is expedient to do so in order to give effect to the Order madebythe Courton12 September2018 thatthe trustees sellthe Waipu land(as definedin the pleadings) to Douglas McKelveyDuncan or his nominee for $1,875,000, ought, orders that the Waipu land be vested solelyin Rere Raima Sutherland.  [6] Iam satisfiedthat Ihavejurisdiction to makeanorder –effectivelybyconsent, as evidenced bythesettlementagreement –that thetrustees sellthe landto Mr Duncan on the proposed terms. However, Ido not think that, sitting as anAssociate Judge, I have jurisdiction to make the supplementary order sought as quoted above.  [7] Accordingly, I make an order in the terms of the draft order presented by MrGilbert with his memorandum, which reflects the terms of the settlement agreement.  [8] If the plaintiff requires an additional order pursuant to pt 5 of the Trustee Act in order to be able to give effect to the order I am making, she will have to make a formal application, supported as necessaryby affidavit evidence, and that application will, in my view, have to be dealt with by a High Court judge (unless summary judgment is sought).

Summary judgment is sought.  [2] The application for summary judgment was first called in this Court on 20 September 2018. Mr Wright appeared on that occasion. He expressed a determination to reach some accommodation with the Official Assignee which would enable him and Mrs Wright to retain their home. I suggested that it might be helpful were he to obtain some advice from his solicitors or accountants. I adjourned the  THE OFFICIALASSIGNEE IN BANKRUPTCYIN THE ESTATE OF ELLEN CHRISTINE WRIGHT vWRIGHT [2018] NZHC 2822[31 October 2018]  OfficialAssignee’s application to today’s dateto give himan opportunityto do so, and to attempt to resolve matters with the Official Assignee. Irecord in this regard that Mrs Wright’s bankrupt estate apparently has debts of less than $100,000 and the propertywhich is the subject matterof this proceedingis allbut unencumbered. Ialso understand that Mr Wright is in employment and receives superannuation. The opportunity to borrow to discharge Mrs Wright’s obligations would appear to be a realistic one.  [3] When the matter was called today Mr Wright told me that he has approached lawyers but is not willing or able to pay costs. Despite myurging, hedoes not appear to havemadeanygenuineattemptto settle matterswith the Official Assignee. In short there has been no progress.  [4] Mr Wright also told me in emphatic terms that the Official Assignee had made no attempt since his wife’s bankruptcy to resolve matters relating to the family home with him. That is plainly wrong.  There is evidence of correspondence between the Official Assignee’s solicitors and solicitors acting for Mr Wright.  [5] The OfficialAssignee is entitled to the orders it seeks and, having had regard to the considerations set out in s 442 of the Property LawAct, and to everything that MrWright has had to say, I now make orders in terms of the prayer for relief contained in her statement of claim dated 27 July 2018.  [6] The Official Assignee is also entitled to her costs and I award costs in the sum of $10,258 plus disbursements in the sum of $1,957.75.  Associate Judge Johnston  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OFNEWZEALAND I TE KOTI MANA NUI  SC 81/2018 [2018] NZSC 99  BETWEEN  MARIE DEANNE CASTLE Applicant   AND  WHAKATANE DISTRICT COUNCIL Respondent    Court: William Young, Glazebrook and Ellen France JJ Counsel: Applicant in person PMoodley for Respondent Judgment: 30 October 2018    JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  A The applicationfor leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant is topay costs of $2,500 to the respondent.    REASONS  [1] Theapplicant seeks leavetoappeal againstajudgment of Woolford Jdelivered on 10 July 2018 in which he dismissed her application for a declaration of invalidity in respect of rates assessed by the Whakatane District Council against two properties which she owns. 1 She issued these proceedings after the Council had obtained judgment against her for outstanding rates.   [2] The properties had been declared by the District Court to be abandoned; this pursuant to s77of the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002. Thisentitled theCouncil to sell them by public tender and they were acquired by the applicant in 2012. After  Castle v Whakatane District Council [2018] NZHC 1687.  MARIE DEANNE CASTLE vWHAKATANE DISTRICTCOUNCIL[2018] NZSC 99 [30 October 2018]  she acquired the properties, the Council sent rates assessment notices to the applicant giving her notice of liability for the rates owed in relation to the properties. From March 2014to July2015,the applicantmadeonlynominal payments towards the rates she owed. The Council issued rates recovery proceedings in September 2014 and, after judgment was entered against the applicant, took steps to enforce the judgment.  [3] The applicant’s broad position seems to be that her method of acquiring the properties means that they are no longer liable for rates and for the purposes of this argument she relies on the long repealed provisions of The Sale for Non-payment of Rates Act 1862. This statute provided a memorialising process associated with the recovery of rates and that where the rates in issue were later paid a memorial of satisfaction would be registered, discharging the land from the charge previously created. Self-evidently, the statute did not purport to exempt such land from future rates demands.  [4] In his judgment, Woolford J pointed outthe governingstatute now is the Local Government (Rating)Act 2002 and that,underthat Act, the applicant is liableforrates on the properties.  [5] The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal against the judgment of Woolford J but this appeal was deemed abandoned as she did not provide security for costs. Her application for leave to appeal direct to this Court from the High Court  falls to be determined under s 75 of the Senior Courts Act 2016 and requires her to establish that thereareexceptional circumstances which warrant the grantingof leave. This shehas not doneand the application is accordinglydismissed. Sheis to paythe respondent costs of $2,500.  Solicitors: Brookfields Lawyers,Auckland for Respondent

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors/Counsel: Bannister & von Dadelszen, Hastings. Hesketh Henry, Auckland. DM Kerr, Napier.  Copy to:  Plaintiff  WEST v WEST [2018] NZHC 2787 [29 October 2018]  [1] In 2014, Jack West transferred his Auckland property to his two adult sons, David and Geoffrey.  In 2016, Jack claimed the property should be returned because the transfer constituted an unconscionable bargain, and was the product of undue influence.  In 2017, I heard—and dismissed—Jack’s claim.1 Jack has appealed to the Court of Appeal.  He seeks a stay pending appeal.2 Geoffrey and David oppose the application.  The third defendant, Langley Twigg Law, abides.  [2] It is not clear why Jack seeks a stay.  Jack dismissed his barrister late in the case and remains self-represented.  Jack’s submissions in support of the stay assert trial error. That, however, is a matter for the Court of Appeal.   [3] A stay is unnecessary. My judgment was declaratory; it did not disturb the status quo.  Jack continues to live at the property.  By the terms of the transfer, he may do so for as long as he wishes.  And, Jack’s potential interest remains protected by a caveat.  Geoffrey and David agree the caveat may remain in force until Jack’s appeal is determined.  [4] The application is dismissed.  [5] Geoffrey and David seek 2B costs.  I award them because the application was unsuccessful.  And, without merit.   ……………………………..

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI MANANUI SC 50/2018 [2018] NZSC 93  BETWEEN JEREMY JAMES McGUIRE Applicant AND NEW ZEALAND LAW SOCIETY Respondent Court: Elias CJ, Glazebrook and Ellen France JJ Counsel: Applicant in person P N Collins for Respondent Judgment: 11 October 2018  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.   B Costs of $2,500 are awarded to the respondent.  REASONS  [1] Mr McGuire seeks leave to appeal against a decision of the Court of Appeal of 6 June 20181 dismissing an appeal against a decision of the High Court,2 and an application to adduce further evidence.  [2] In the High Court, Courtney J had allowed, but only in part, Mr McGuire’s application for judicial review of a decision of the Canterbury Westland Standards Committee. The Committee had upheld a complaint made by a client of Mr McGuire’s and found him guilty of “unsatisfactory conduct” pursuant to s 152(2)(b) of the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006.  1 McGuire v New Zealand Law Society [2018] NZCA 184 (French, Ellis and Woolford JJ). 2 McGuire v New Zealand Law Society [2017] NZHC 2484 (Courtney J).  JEREMY JAMES McGUIRE v NEW ZEALAND LAW SOCIETY [2018] NZSC 93 [11 October 2018]  [3] The matters Mr McGuire seeks to raise are all related to the particular factual circumstances of the case and do not raise any issues of general or public importance. Nor does anything raised by Mr McGuire suggest that the Court of Appeal’s decision may have been erroneous.   [4] This means the application for leave to appeal must be dismissed, with costs of $2,500 awarded to the respondent.  Solicitors: C L Walker, New Zealand Law Society, Wellington for Respondent

B Theapplicant is to pay costs of$2,500 to therespondent.  REASONS  Background  [1] Since 2012 Mr WK has made four unsuccessful claims under theImmigration Act 2009 for refugee or protected person status. He is Turkish and came to New Zealand in 2011.   [2] On his fourth claim (made on 21 March 2017), the Refugee and Protection Officer considered the claim to be manifestly unfounded, abusive and a repeat of  WK vREFUGEEAND PROTECTION OFFICER [2018] NZSC 91 [10 October 2018]  previous claims.  On 8 May2017 he therefore exercised hisdiscretion under s 140(3) of theImmigration Act to refuse to consider the claim.   [3] Mr WK applied for judicial review of this decision which was dismissed by the High Court.1 TheHigh Court also dismissed his attemptto introducenew evidence duringand after the hearing. MrWK appealed to theCourt of Appeal, seekingalso to adducefurther evidence.2 Both his applications weredismissed. Mr WK was deported to Turkey on 2August 2018.   Application  [4] Mr WK seeks leaveto appeal on anumberof grounds hesays are legal issues of general or publicimportance, includingthe interpretation of s 140, the threshold for the admission of evidence and the standard of review. He also challenges the application of the law to his case.  Our assessment  [5] Nothing raised by Mr WK suggests that the result would have been different even under thelegal tests headvocates. In anyevent, as the Crownsubmits, the appeal is mootbecauseMr WK has left NewZealand.3 It is thus not in the interestsof justice to hear the proposed appeal.  Result  [6] Theapplication forleaveto appeal is dismissed. Theapplicant is to paycosts of $2,500 to the respondent.

B  The approved ground of appeal is whether the High Court was correct to dismiss Mr Sena’s appeal against conviction brought under s 232(2)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011.    REASONS  [1] After a Judge-alone trial, Mr Sena was found guilty on five charges of assaultingtwochildren.1 Heappealedunsuccessfullyagainstconviction andsentence  R v Sena [2017]NZDC 3564 (Judge Henwood).  YUSUKE (DAVID) SENAv NEWZEALANDPOLICE [2018] NZSC 92 [10 October 2018]  to the High Court.2 Leaveto bringasecondappeal in relation to his conviction having been declined bytheCourt of Appeal,3leaveis sought to appeal directlyto this Court.  [2] In dismissingthe application forleave, the Court of Appeal did not accept the submission forMrSenathat, on anappeal under s232(2)(b)of theCriminal Procedure Act 2011 followingaJudge-alone trial, hewas entitled to the High Court Judge’s “own assessment of the evidence”.4 “Rather”, the Courtof Appeal observed, “thefunction the Judge undertook – that of review – is precisely what the relevant authorities require”.5  [3] The proposed appeal to this Court would raise a question as to the correct approach to betaken on an appeal under s 232(2)(b). That section provides that afirst appeal must beallowed wherethe Court is satisfied that, “in the caseof aJudge-alone trial, the Judge erred in his or her assessment of the evidence to such an extent that a miscarriage of justice has occurred”.  [4] Theapproachto appellatereview under s 232(2)(b)isaquestion of general and public importance. It is also unclear when the question may arise again for determination in this Court given the issue will likelybedetermined in the same way if raised again in the Court of Appeal.

REASONS  [1] This is an application for a review of a decision of the Registrar declining to accept a notice of appeal for filing.  CLEMENTS vTHE QUEEN OF ENGLAND[2018] NZCA403 [5 October 2018]  [2] On 21 September 2018 the applicant, Miriam Clements, purported to file a notice of application for leave to bring a criminal appeal. The notice refers to some 18 allegedly erroneous judicial decisions relating to unspecified “criminal proceedings”. It would appear that Ms Clements is endeavouring to file a private prosecution, and that so far her endeavours to do so have proved unsuccessful.   [3] The way in which she had purported to file that appeal does not comply with this Court’s rules. Most importantly, she has not specified, by reference to the name and filenumberof the proceedings, just which applications have been declined which she now wishes to appeal. The Registrar properly brought those matters to Ms Clements’attention.  [4] In her application for review, Ms Clements refers to the provisions of this Court’s rules that state that non-compliance with the rules does not prevent a party from continuing to take part in the appeal.  [5] However, that rule goes on to allow the Court to direct the partyto remedythe matter.  That is exactly what the Registrar did.  [6] The application for review of the Registrar’s decision is declined.

B The approved questions of law onwhich leave is granted are:  1. Did the New Zealand Lawyers and Conveyancers Tribunal and theHigh Court comply with s 351 of the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006 in (respectively):  (a)  finding charge 1 proved and upholding that finding; and   (b)  deciding upon and upholding penalty?    2. Did the High Court reach its own conclusions on the merits of the appeal? If it did not, what consequences should follow in the circumstances of this case?  MORAHAN vWELLINGTON STANDARDS COMMITTEE 2 [2018] NZCA407[5 October 2018]  REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byWilliams J)  [1] The Court grants leave to appeal on the following questions of law:  Question 1: Did the New Zealand Lawyers and Conveyancers Disciplinary Tribunal and the High Court comply with s 351 of the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006 in (respectively):  (a)  finding charge 1 proved and upholding that finding; and   (b)  deciding upon and upholding penalty?    Question 2: Did the High Court reach its own conclusions on themerits of the appeal? If itdid not, what consequences should follow in the circumstances of this case?  [2] TheCourt otherwisedeclines leave on the questions of lawposed byMr Beck, forMr Morahan. Wedo notaccept that anyissueof lawmeritingtheCourt’s attention israised bythewaythechargeswereframed,which was orthodox, 1 with the exception of the issues raised bytheapplicabilityof s 351of the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act. In particular the grant of leave on question 1 does not extend to whether indemnity costs must be reserved only for cases that would have qualified for such award in general civil proceedings.  [3] The remaining questions posed are either not seriously arguable and/or fail to raise a question of general or public importance.

REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byMiller J)  [1] The respondents move to strike this appeal out under r 37 of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005 forfailureto paysecurityfor costsbyduedateand because, they say, the appeal has no merit and they are prejudiced by delay.  PATEL&ANOR v GRANTAND JACQUELINE MACLEOD AS TRUSTEES OF THE MACLEODTRUST [2018] NZCA382 [20September 2018]  [2] The judgment appealed from denied the Patels relief against forfeiture of leasehold property.1  [3] The appeal was filed on 11 April 2018 and security of $6,600 was due by 10 May. It was not paid. After the strikeout application was filed the Patels paid security. However, they did not pay the setting-down fee of $2,700. Brown J determined that the appeal would bedeemed abandoned forpurposes of r 43 if the fee was not paid.  That was deemed to have happened on 12 July 2018.

[2] The application has been made without notice because the plaintiff is concerned that the second defendant could attempt to pass aspecial resolution placing the first defendant into liquidation, “at a moment’s notice”.   MUNFORD v MR &LE MUNFORDLTD [2018] NZHC 2473 [20 September 2018]  [3] It is, however, essential that the first and second defendants be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to the application.  [4] To achieve this, I will issue the interim injunction sought by the plaintiff but, for a strictly limited period of time.   [5] The application and supporting affidavits are to be served on the first and second defendants. The Court will make time available to hear the application for an injunction on Tuesday 2 October2018. Two hours have been allocated.  [6] If Mr Mahuta-Coyle is unable to appear that day, alternative counsel will need to be instructed.  [7] In the meantime, I grant the interim application sought until further order of the Court.  Ido so because, I am satisfied there is areasonablyarguably claim and the balance of convenience justifies the granting of the interim injunction for the limited period that I have indicated.

There is a “good arguable” case and the balance of convenience justifies the granting of a freezing order.  [3] There are also sound reasons for the application being made without notice.

Judge G C Hollister-Jones refused interim name suppression but did grant limited temporary name suppression for a matter of weeks, solely to mirror corresponding name suppression granted to Mr Sykes’co-defendant on the basis that identifying Mr Sykes maylead to identification of his co-defendant.  [2] Mr Sykes appealed the refusal to grant interim name suppression. However, his counsel advised prior to the appeal hearing that no argument would be advanced on Mr Sykes’behalf, separatelyfrom that ofhis co-defendant. Counsel sought to be excused and there was no appearance for Mr Sykes at the appeal hearing. I am satisfied that there is no basis for continued name suppression for Mr Sykes.

REASONS  [1] Miriam Clements wishes to appeal against ajudgment of Woolford Jdelivered in the High Court at Auckland on 29 August 2018.1  Clements vThe Queen ofEngland [2018]NZHC 2244.  CLEMENTS vTHE QUEEN OF ENGLAND[2018] NZCA373 [17 September 2018]  [2] Ms Clements sent a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal by email on 13 September 2018. The Registrar advised Ms Clements that a civil appeal can only be filed in hard copy form and cannot be filed by way of email.   [3] Ms Clements now applies for a review of the Registrar’s decision. She states that shedoes not have the money tocourier the documents to theCourt. Thefilehas been referred to me.  [4] The application for review of the Registrar’s decision must be declined.  Rule 31(1) of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005 reads:  31 Mode of bringing appeal  (1) An appeal is brought only when—  (a)  the appellant files the notice of appealin the Registry—   (i)  by delivering it by hand to the Registry; or   (ii)  bysendingit bymail to a postaladdress published by the Registrar; and     (b)  a copy of the notice of appeal is served on every person who is a party to the proceedingin the court appealed from.    [5] Accordingly, if Ms Clements wishes to pursue her appeal, she will need to comply with this rule, including by arranging hand delivery or by posting the notice of appeal in hard copy form to the Court.

[2] I accept the two questions of law formulated in Ms Want’s application dated 3 September 2018 dulymeet therequirements forleave, as the appellantsaccept. There are now two inconsistent High Court decisions on the correct interpretation of the  Parbu v Want [2018] NZHC 2079.  PARBHU v WANT[2018] NZHC 2411 [13September 2018]  provisionsof the Residential Tenancies Act. Therehavebeen several decisions of the Tenancy Tribunal concerning the matters to which the interpretation issues relate, so thecorrect interpretation of the provisionsis amatter of wider interest.2 Theissues are properly addressed by the Court ofAppeal. I accordinglygrant leave to appeal.  [3] The appellants have also sought that I make an order as contemplated by s45(5)of the Legal Services Act 2011. Under s 45costscan onlybe awarded against a legal aided person if there are exceptional circumstances, and there are no such circumstances in the present case. Anorder can then bemadebythe Court specifying what order of costs would have been madeagainst the legallyaided person if s 45 had not affected that person’s liability.   [4] I accept that such an order should be made, and agree with counsel for the appellants that but for s 45 costs would have been awarded against the respondent on a 2B basis in the amount set out in the schedule to his memorandum of 12 September 2018,totalling $14,495. I order accordingly.   Cooke J  Solicitors: Loughlin McGuire &Roud Lawyers,Auckland for the Appellants  See Parbhu v Want, at [11], footnotes 9 and 10.

The application is dated 5 September 2018. It was, however, only filed in this Court yesterday.  [2] The application was referred to me in my capacity as Duty Judge. I directed that it should be served on the Crown.  I also set the matter down for hearing today, given the requirements of the Habeas Corpus Act 2001.  [3] Ms McKenna, for the Crown, filed helpful submissions.  Annexed to those submissions were various documents, including warrants of commitment signed by Judge Phillips in the District Court at Dunedin on 12 January 2016.  Mr Fisi had not previously seen those documents.  We went through them and he accepts that his calculations are in error.  [4] I am satisfied that Mr Fisi is currently lawfully detained pursuant to a sentence of imprisonment of three years and six months imposed by Judge Phillips on 12 January 2016.1 It appears from a prisoner movements document filed by the Department of Corrections that Mr Fisi was remanded in custody on 25 August 2015.  According to the Department’s calculations, he is entitled to credit for time served of 140 days. Ms McKenna has calculated that that means that Mr Fisi’s release date falls due on 21 February 2019 and not before.  [5] So far as I can ascertain, the committal warrants are in order and there is no reason to go behind them.   [6] The application for habeas corpus is dismissed.

SIEMER v NEWZEALAND LAWSOCIETY& OR [2018]NZHC 2400 [12 September 2018]  [1] This proceeding is a judicial reviewapplication by Jane Siemer in respect of a decision by the New Zealand Law Society (NZLS) declining to take further action in relation to Mrs Siemer’s complaint about a Disputes Tribunal referee, Mr Luke.  [2] On 7 August 2018, Fitzgerald J issued a minute addressing timetable issues. At the conclusion, Her Honour noted that:  … Mrs Siemer records that she is content to have the judicial review determined onthe papers. She states that she is not alawyer andnever wanted a hearing. Nevertheless, Mrs Siemer has commenced these proceedings and chooses torepresentherself. I decline tomake anorder that the matter proceed on the papers. Substantive hearings, particularly in judicial review proceedings, are in my view appropriately dealt with by way of a hearing. It is usually more efficient and helpful to the Court to have a hearing, even if brief, to enable the issues to be ventilated and the Court to seek clarification from counsel/the parties on any queries or questions it may have.  It of course remains open to the Judge to whom the substantive hearing is allocated to direct that it be dealt with on the papers …  [3] Subsequent to that minute, the proceeding was set down for a half-day fixture today. However, Mrs Siemer did not appearto advance her application. At 10.20 am, with no appearance and no communication from Mrs Siemer as to her intentions, I dismissed the application and made an order in favour of the NZLS for costs on a 2B basis. My reason was that Fitzgerald J had made it very clear in her minute that this matter would not be dealt with on the papers and that if Mrs Siemer wished to prosecute her application, she needed to appearin support of itat the allocated hearing date.

Copy to:  Applicant  YOUXIN LI vCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFMINISTRYOF BUSINESS INNOVATIONAND EMPLOYMENT [2018] NZHC 2346[7 September 2018]  [1] On 6 June 2018, I refused Mr Youxin Li leave to appeal, or review, a decision of the Immigration and Protection Tribunal.1 My judgment was silent on costs. The Crown seeks 2B costs.  Counsel for Mr Li no longer holds instructions.  [2] There is no obvious reason why the Crown should not have costs. Mr Li was unsuccessful.2 No special rule affects immigration cases, even when the unsuccessful party may be impecunious.3 And, there is no evidence Mr Li is impecunious. On that before me, Mr Li had been in paid employment for many years.  [3] 2B costs are awarded to the Crown.  ……………………………..

Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date:…………………………  Counsel/Solicitors: Buddle Findlay,Auckland Gault Mitchell Law, Wellington  Re an application Jackson and Graham (Forestlands) [2018] NZHC 2300[3September 2018]  [1] Messrs Neale Jackson and Grant Graham, partners of the firm KordaMentha, have filed an originating application seeking orders under s 280 of the Companies Act 1993 permitting them to act as liquidators of Forestlands N.Z. Limited (FNZ). They have also filed an associated application for leave to commence proceedings by way of originating application.  [2] The matter came before Katz J who by Minute dated 31 August 2018 directed that the application be served on Leaders Real Estate (1987) Limited (Leaders). She listed the matter for mention in the Duty Judge list on Monday 3 September 2018.  [3] Later that morning Counsel for Leaders, Mr Matsis, advised the Registry of his unavailability (other than by telephone) on 3 September. I accordingly convened two telephone conferences with counsel on the afternoon of 31 October 2018.  [4] At the conclusion of the second of those conferences Mr Matsis advised that his client did not oppose the application on the basis that leave be reserved to Leaders and all other creditors to apply to set aside any subsequent appointment of Messrs Jackson and Graham as liquidators.  [5] I publish this as a results judgment with more comprehensive reasons to follow.  [6] I am satisfied that:  [a] The matter is properly commenced by way of originating application.  [b] The application by Messrs Jackson and Graham to act as liquidators of FNZ is appropriately granted.   [7] I make orders accordingly. In respect of the order in [6(b)] I do so on the terms of the attached draft with the qualification that the costs referred to in Order 3(iii) are limited to those which are actual and reasonable.

B No order as to costs.  REASONS  [1] The applicant has been remanded in custody for sentencing following conviction for assault with intent to injure contrary to s 193 of the Crimes Act 1961. He seeks leave to appeal to this Court against a decision of the High Court dismissing his application for habeas corpus.1  [2] The primary argument the applicant wishes to make is that the District Court had no jurisdiction.2 To illustrate the proposed approach, he wishes to argue there is  1 Turner v Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2018] NZHC 1948 (Fitzgerald J). 2 The applicant also says proper procedures have not been followed in considering his claim.  MOKO PUNA TUA TAHI TURNER v CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS [2018] NZSC 83 [3 September 2018]  no evidence native customary title has been extinguished in relation to certain land and that this affects the jurisdiction of the District Court in this case.  [3] Where leave to appeal directly to this Court is sought the Court must not grant leave unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying taking the proposed appeal directly to this Court.3 As Fitzgerald J noted, the applicant does not raise any issue as to the validity of the warrant which has been produced.4 In these circumstances, there is nothing about the proposed appeal that suggests any exceptional circumstances arise to justify a direct appeal.  [4] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  We make no order as to costs.  Solicitors: Crown Law Office, Wellington for Respondent  3 This in addition to the usual criteria:  Senior Courts Act 2016, s 75; and Supreme Court Act 2003, s 14.  4 The Judge also referred to ss 14(1A) and 14(2)(b) of the Habeas Corpus Act 2001.

D v NEW ZEALAND POLICE [2018] NZCA 337 [31 August 2018]  [2] Counsel should also address the merits.

B Order prohibiting publication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in news media or on the internet or other publicly available database until final disposition of trial. Publication in law report or law digest permitted.  REASONS  [1] The applicant faces charges associated with an incident which took place at a  market. It is alleged that he fired a sawn-off rifle at members of a rival gang. The  police have obtained from confidential sources a photograph which depicts the  applicant in the companyof aco-offender. TheCrowncaseis that the photograph was  CODYJAMES FANE v R [2018] NZSC 82[29August 2018]  taken at the market on the day of the offending. To establish the authenticity of the photograph (that is, that it depicts the applicant at the market on that day), the Crown will rely on evidence which includes that of a stall-holder who will say that she (and her stall)areshown in thephotograph and that the incident recorded in the photograph took place on the same day as, and just before, the shooting incident.  [2] The applicant challenges the admissibility of the photograph. This challenge was dismissed in the District Court and, on appeal, bythe Court of Appeal. Henow seeks leave to appeal.  [3] The applicant’s submissions do not specifically address s 74(4) of the Senior Courts Act 2016. This provides that, incases ofthis sort, leave mustnot be granted unless the Court is satisfied that:  it is necessary in the interests of justice for the Supreme Court to hear and determine the proposed appealbefore the proceedingconcerned is concluded.  [4] All issues which the applicant wishes to argue could, if necessary, be satisfactorilydealtwith in thecontext of apost-trial appeal. For this reason, the s74(4) criterion is not satisfied and the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.   [5] To protect Mr Fane’s fair trial rights, wemakean order prohibitingpublication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in news media or on the internet or other publicly available database until final disposition of trial.

It says that theCourt has wronglyapplied theguiltyplea discount at the same time as other discounts, rather than as a final step. The effect is to lessen the level of fine from that which it would be if Hessell v R were followed.2  [2] We do not need to hear from counsel for Tasman Tanning. We agree that the approach indicated in Hessell is as WorkSafe suggests.  Whether applying a different methodology leads to an incorrect sentence is a different issue that need not be addressed here. As the Court of Appeal has said on a number of occasions, it is the ultimate end sentence that is important, rather than how it is crafted. The judgment was not intended to, and cannot, foreshadow a general departure from Hessell.  [3] Thematteris not onethatcomes within theusual rules concerningrecall.3 The application is declined.

Ireserved costs, indicating that mypreliminaryview was that the plaintiff was entitled to costs on a 2B basis but that if counsel were unable to agree as to costs — as has transpired — I would deal with them on the papers.  [2] I now have memoranda from Ms Hamlen-Williams for the plaintiff (2) and MrKang for the defendant. Theplaintiff seeks costs on a2Bbasis of $13,826 plus disbursements of $1,400 totalling $15,226. The defendant resists such an order, contending for various reasons that any award of costs should be lower.  KAWANA-MOUAT v MOUAT[2018] NZHC 2123[17August 2018]  [3] Onepointraised byMr Kanghaspersuaded methat Ishould not simplyaward costs to the plaintiff on a 2B basis as I had originally anticipated doing. He reminds me that the core claim in this case was forless than $37,000and therefore well within the District Court’s jurisdiction.  [4] As the successful party the plaintiff is entitled to an award of costs.  However, on balance I have reached the view that those costs should be the lesser of his actual costs or costs on a 2B basis under the District Court scale set out in Part 14 and Schedule 5of the District Court Rules 2014,togetherwith thedisbursements based on District Court filing and sealing fees.

The claim was for 2.5 days in accordance with the schedule. Mr Pidgeon, acknowledging that he had not acted for WK in the substantive proceeding, queried whether 2.5 days was reasonable.

The reduced total, inclusive of disbursements, is $24,945.66.  [6] I am satisfied that the items now claimed are properly claimed and that there is no reason not to make an award of costs in this case.  [7] In consequence, thereisan order that the applicant paythe respondentforcosts and disbursements a total of $24,945.66.

The OfficialAssignee was represented byMr Kerr. Therewas no appearancebyor forthe defendant.  Thedefendant has taken no step in this proceeding.  [2] The bankrupt, Bruce Roberts, and the defendant, Helen Roberts, are a married couple. They are the registered proprietors, as joint tenants, of two adjourning properties in Lind Street in Feilding. Mr Roberts was adjudicated bankrupt in this Court on 6 April 2017.  As a matter of law his adjudication operated to sever the joint tenancyin respect of each of the two properties and to vest his interest in them in the Official Assignee as the Assignee of his Estate in bankruptcy. Oneof theproperties is subject to a mortgage registered by the ANZ National Bank Ltd.  THE OFFICIALASSIGNEE IN BANKRUPTCYIN THE ESTATE OF BRUCE HAMILTON ROBERTS v HELEN ANNE ROBERTS [2018] NZHC 2027[9August 2018]  [3] On 29 May 2018 the plaintiff commenced this proceeding as a means of realisingMr Robert’sinterest in the properties. Bynoticeofapplication dated 29 May 2018 she sought summaryjudgment against the defendant.  [4] As already recorded, the defendant has taken no steps to oppose that application.  [5] Accordingly, the plaintiff is entitled to seek judgment by default.  [6] Prior to today’s hearing Mr Kerr arranged to file an affidavit made by Ms JoanneBasher whois the OfficialAssigneeat both Wellington and Napierandhas overall responsibility in relation to this matter. Ms Basher’s affidavit records the history of the matter. It is unnecessary for me to relate this here.  [7] I am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to the judgment she seeks and I enter judgment in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant in terms set out in the prayer or relief contained in the plaintiff’s statement of claim.  [8] Theplaintiff is entitled to costs on aCategory Bbasiswhich I set at $9,812.00 together with disbursements of $2,042.85.

Given that the memorandum indicated that the application for a stay would be made, and the appearances were involved thereafter to    1  Openyd Ltd v G J Lawrence Dental Ltd [2018] NZHC 1618.  case manage the matter in light of this, they seem to me to be properly claimed as costs associated with the successful application.  The respondent is accordingly entitled to them.    [3] The applicant also disputes the disbursement for bundle printing and binding in the amount of $440.25, which counsel for the applicant says should have been broadly equivalent to an earlier claim that it had made in the amount of $137.34.  I see no reason to doubt that this disbursement was in fact incurred, or to find the cost was unreasonable, and accordingly it is also allowed.   [4] I conclude that by observing such minor differences associated with a costs award should have been resolved by discussion between counsel.

Registrar / Deputy Registrar  Solicitors:  Simpson Western, Takapuna  CASHFLOWDEBTOR FINANCE PTYLTD vPARKER [2018] NZHC 1951 [1August 2018]  [1] The applicant seeks an order extending this Court’s 9 August 2016 charging order for a further 55 weeks from its expiry on 9 August 2018.  [2] The charging order was made in enforcement of the applicant’s Australian judgment for AU$148,482.74, plus interest and costs. Charging orders automatically expires after two years from the date of their making, unless extended under HCR 17.52(2) on grounds such extension is “just”.1  [3] The extension is sought to hedge against non-implementation of settlement arrangements agreed between the parties, which areto becompleted within thesought 55 weeks. Absent completion of the settlement arrangements within that period, the judgment would remain to be enforced, including by the applicant’s resort to the charged properties. I am satisfied it is just to extend the effect of the charging order for that necessary period, which is briefly (and sensibly) longer than that in which settlement is to be implemented.  [4] Counsel for the applicant, Peter Hall, advised the respondent (served with the present application) has taken no part in this proceeding, other than to contend to Mr Hall one of the five charged properties – 18 WastneyTerrace, Nelson: NL3B/714 – is not owned by him, but another Steven Joseph Parker. Mr Parker undertook to investigate that contention, and to advise the Court by memorandum whether the charge on that property should be discharged.  [5] In reliance on Mr Hall’s undertaking, which also goes to the ‘justice’ of the extension, I extend the effect of this Court’s 9 August 2016 charging orders until Thursday, 29 August 2019.  —Jagose J  Bank of New Zealand v Taleta [2015] NZHC 2821 at [10].  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OFNEW ZEALAND   I TE KOTI MANA NUI  SC 33/2018 [2018] NZSC 65   BETWEEN  DONNYFALAKOA Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, William Young and O’Regan JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person K Peirse-O’Byrne for Respondent   Judgment:  31 July 2018    JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  The applicationfor leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant was sentenced to 13 years, six months’ imprisonment for offending involving: aggravated robbery, assault with intent to rob, receiving stolen property, dangerous driving, unlawfully getting into a motor vehicle, aggravated assault, intentional damage, using a firearm against a police officer, theft of a motor vehicle, reckless discharge of afirearm and conversion of amotor vehicle.1 He appealed against that sentence to the Court ofAppeal on the basis that the 25 per cent discount allowed by Judge Blackie, the sentencing Judge (for pleas of guilty, mental health issues and remorse) from the starting point of 17 years, six months was inadequate.2 In the Court of Appeal, counsel for the applicant contended that the discount should have been 30 per cent. This argument was addressed and dismissed  1 R v Falakoa [2015] NZDC 20574 (Judge Blackie). 2 Falakoa v R [2016] NZCA202 (Harrison, Simon France andWoolford JJ).  DONNYFALAKOAv R [2018] NZSC 65[31 July2018]  by the Court ofAppeal which commented that a discount of 30 per cent “could well be seen as unduly lenient”.3 The applicant now seeks leave to appeal to this Court.  [2] In his submissions, the applicant maintains that the overall sentence was excessive and complains that no discrete allowance was given for his mental health issues and remorse. Thestartingpoint adoptedbythe Judge was not challengedin the Court of Appeal. So we do not have theadvantageof that Court’s consideration of the issue.  The same is also true of the challenge to the undifferentiated and global nature of the discount for mitigating factors. In respect of this latter issue, there is also the practical consideration that, providing the total allowance for mitigating factors was appropriate (which is what the Court of Appeal concluded), its make-up is of limited practical moment.    [3] We are conscious that the sentence imposed was severe. But, having regard to the considerations just mentioned, we have reached the viewthat the proposed appeal raises no issue of public or general importance and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.4  [4] Theapplicant also seeks to challengehis conviction forusingafirearm against a police officer. This charge was laid under s 198A(1) of the Crimes Act 1961. He contends that he should have been prosecuted under s 198A(2) which carries a lower maximumpenalty. On our reviewof the summaryof facts, weare of the view that the charge in issue was appropriately laid under the former subsection. We note as well theapplicant did not appeal to the Court of Appeal againsthis convictiononthis charge and hehas advanced nothingto suggest that thereareexceptional circumstances ofthe kind which would warrant granting leave to appeal direct to this Court.5  [5] Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

He also wished to waive his right to a pre-sentence report and to be sentenced immediately.  [2] I do not propose to set out the facts giving rise to the charge again. They are set out in my sentence indication that will be annexed to these remarks and will form part of them. In short, I selected a starting point of 15 months imprisonment. I then applied a discount of three months to reflect restrictive EM bail conditions, and a further discount of three months to reflect any guilty plea. This produced an end sentence of nine months imprisonment.  [3] Mr Kingi hastodayprovided mewithaletterin which heexpresses hisremorse and says that he no longer wishes to be involved in the type of activitythat has given rise to the present charge. I am gratified to hear that Mr Kingi seeks to modify his ways in the future. In the end, however, the expressions of remorse are not such that I propose to reduce the sentence further.   Sentence  [4] On the charge of rioting, Mr Kingi, you are sentenced to nine months imprisonment.  [5] Stand down.

When the matter was called at 10.00 am there was no appearance and an order was made adjudicatingher bankrupt as at 10.16 am. Ms Bassett has subsequentlyappeared. She seeks to have that order revisited.   [2] I understand from discussion with her that she may have a joint interest in a property subject to a mortgage. She is currently in receipt of superannuation. The debt however goes back to a business Ms Bassett operated. I am advised by the Commissioner’s counsel that itgoes back tothe income yearendingMarch2016. The judgment debt was entered in the District Court on 20 September 2017.

However, despite those personal circumstances four weeks have passed without the matter being advanced at all.  Iam advised that a proposal had previouslybeen put andconsidered and rejected.

It relates to a judgment entered in the Tauranga District Court on 17 May 2013 in the sum of $223,728.82 including costs.  [2] When the matter was first before the Court it was adjourned. Mr Moncur has filed anotice of intention to opposethe application foradjournment.  In thatnotice he makes a number of points. He says that the mediation agreement upon which the judgment is based was entered under duress. The judgment relates to former relationship issues. Mr Moncur considers that hehad acted reasonablyin dealingwith the relationship issues but that the business that hehad hoped to trade out ofdifficulty was unsuccessful and his business was put into liquidation.  [3] Despite the efforts that Mr Moncur has made to address his personal circumstances he has been unable to do so. He is now suffering from a number of health related issues. He advises the Court that he has no material wealth, does not own a home or anything of that nature.   [4] Although filingthe oppositionMr Moncur hasnotraised anythingof substance in terms ofapositivedefenceto the applicationforadjudication. After discussion with himIunderstand his position to benowthat hedoes not formallyopposeadjudication.  It may well be that given his current situation an adjudication and the ability for him to effectively clear his slate will not be too much of a disadvantage.   [5] In the circumstances I am satisfied that the grounds for the adjudication are made out. There will be an order adjudicating Mr Moncur bankrupt.   [6] There will be an order for costs on a 2B basis together with disbursements as fixed by the Registrar.  The order is timed at 11.02 am.  Venning J

The essential basis forthis was that Corsair had paid the core component of thedebt and provided securityforthe costs component which was in issue between the parties. That is exactly what the statutory demand served by BC 63891 on Corsair on 13 December 2017 required of it.  [2] BC63891’s statutorydemand was ignored byCorsair. As aresult, BC63891 was obliged to issue this proceeding. When, after its commencement, Corsair engaged with BC 63891, it put forward a series of offers commencing on 9 March 2018 proposing terms for settlement which were less attractive than the ultimate outcome and unacceptable to BC 63891.  BODYCORPORATE 63891 v CORSAIR PRODUCTS LIMITED [2018] NZHC 1844 [24 July2018]  [3] Accordingly, BC63891 continued to prosecute its proceedingas itwas entitled to do.  [4] The reality is that Corsair did not comply with the terms of BC 63891’s statutory demand until immediately prior to the hearing before me.  [5] At that point, BC 63891 could have accepted that it had achieved all that it reasonably expect to achieve in winding up proceedings. It did not. It proceeded. Ultimately, it achieved nothing more than it had been offered.  [6] Against that background, my view is that substantial justice will be done if I allow BC 63891 its costs up to the hearing, but not the costs of the hearing itself or anything after that.  [7] BC 63891 shall have costs totalling $7,805.00 together with disbursements of $1,522.56, an all inclusive figure of $9,327.00.

[2] Igaveleaveto the parties to submitmemoranda. Mr Bedogni, forMr Oliphant, seeks costs on a 2B basis totalling $8,123.65. Mr Clode opposes the award of costs which he requests be reserved until the substantive proceeding is determined, given the judgment determined he has a serious question to be tried.  [3] The usual rule is costs are awarded to the successful party. Rule 14.8 of the High Court Rules 2016 provide costs on an opposed interlocutoryapplication mustbe fixed when the application is determined “unless there are special reasons to the contrary”.   [4] There is no reason why the usual rule should not be followed in this case and there is no special reason why costs should not be fixed now. The observations in the interlocutory judgment about the merits of the substantive case do not suggest otherwise.  [5] I award costs of the interlocutory application to the respondents as sought.

[2] Ms Lord-Hogan died on 14 July 2017. She left a document which appears to be a will but which does not comply with s 11 of the Wills Act 2007 because there is onlyonewitness. Under s 14 of the Wills Act the Court maymake an order declaring the document valid if itis satisfied that the document expresses thedeceased person’s testamentary intentions.  [3] Theapplication is supported byan affidavitof IvyJennifer MareeMacKenzie. Ms MacKenzie is the sole witness to the will. Ms MacKenzie’s detailed evidence, relating to the signing of the will by Ms Lord-Hogan and Ms MacKenzie’s signing as witness,makes clear that the document was intended to beMs Lord-Hogan’s will. No uncertainty arises from the fact that there is only one witness.  [4] This application is madewithoutnotice to anyother party. Iam satisfied that it is appropriate that the application be made without notice.  This is because the only persons who havean interest in the question whetherthe documentisavalid willhave consented to an order being made that it is a valid will. These are the three persons who would bebeneficiaries under Ms Lord-Hogan’s priorwill; awilldated 17 August 2005.   Order  [5] In respect of the document described as “Will of Linda Maria Lord-Hogan” and dated 7 June 2016, a copy of which is annexureAto the affidavit of Ivy Jennifer Maree MacKenzie sworn on 23 June 2018, there is an order declaring this document to be a valid will of Linda Maria Lord-Hogan.

[3] A memorandum for the plaintiff was not filed by 29 June, as required. Following an enquiry by the case officer, at my request, counsel for the plaintiff advised that hehad been unable to obtain instructions. Heresponsiblynoted that, from his perspective, he could not fault the memorandum for the defendants as to the category of costs and steps taken.  [4] I am satisfied the matter should now be determined. I am also satisfied the defendants are entitled to the 2B costs they seek of $20,962. The disbursements include GST. On the assumption that the Ngati Rehua – Ngatiwai Ki Aotea Trust Board is a GST registered party, which seems likely, and on the further assumption that the Trust Board will be meeting the costs of the named defendants, the disbursements should be reduced to theGST exclusive sum of $669.57.

They both relate to a decision of the Legal Aid Tribunal refusing to grant an extension of time for filing an application for review of the Commissioner's refusal to grant Mr Rabson legal aid in  RABSON v LEGAL SERVICES COMMISSIONER [2018] NZI-IC 1579 [28 June 2018]   separate proceedings. 1 The Tribunal refused the extension on the basis that no compelling reason had been given for the delay and the application was in any event without merit.2  [2] The applications related to Mr Rabson's substantive proceedings against Mr Shephard and Ms Dunphy. The background to that proceeding is set out most recently in the judgment of the Supreme Court dismissing Mr Rabson's application for leave to appeal to that Court.3 The proceeding, pursuant to which the legal aid application was made, is therefore at an end and any challenge to the Tribunal's decision can serve no purpose. As I note in my minute of 3 July 2017, following a call in the Chambers list, Mr Rabson nonetheless indicated by email that he wished to maintain his proceedings on foot. I invited him to participate in the Chambers hearing by telephone but I was advised that he declined. I then stood the matter down to Wednesday 5 July and directed Mr Howden for the Legal Services Commissioner to file an application to strike out both challenges to be dealt with on that day. Mr Howden duly filed and served his application on the grounds that no reasonably arguable cause of action could be established and the proceedings were frivolous and vexatious or otherwise an abuse of the Court's process.  [3] Mr Rabson was advised ofthe fixture by the Registry but took no further steps and did not appear. Mr Howden appeared and pressed his application. I conclude therefore that it is in order to deal with this matter in his absence.   Result  [4] In the circumstances of this case, the Commissioner's application is plainly well founded. Both proceedings are struck out accordingly.  [5] The Commissioner will be entitled to costs on a 2A basis. There will be no order for costs in relation to the second respondents who abide. /  Malcolm Edward Rabson [2016] NZLAT 33. At [32]. Rabson v Shephard [2017] NZSC 97.

Brief reasons will follow as soon as practicable.  [2] The substantive application for judicial review is, however, to be heard and determined quickly. To that end counsel are to liaise with the Registry this week with a view to the allocation of a further hearing before me on one of the following dates:  (a)  any of 9, 12 or 13 July 2018; or   (b)  any (working) day between 6 and 17 August 2018.    GOLDEN BAY GRAND STAND COMMUNITY TRUST INCORPORATED v TASMAN DISTRICT COUNCIL [2018] NZHC 1567 [27 June 2018]  [3] I appreciate that none of these days suits Mr Linkhom. However, he advised today that Mr Bennion should be able to appear on behalf of the applicants.  [4] While I suspect that only half a day will be required out of an abundance of caution one day should be allocated.  [5] Given the scope of the hearing today I anticipate that the focus of the substantive hearing will largely be on:  ( a) exploring the circumstances giving rise to s 18 of the Reserves and Other Land Disposal Act 1959 (which will likely require further evidence);   (b)  legal submissions on the nature and scope of the rights conferred by (or underlying) s 18; and   ( c) further legal submissions on whether those rights have been waived.    [6] Counsel may wish to consider the extent of any factual contest in relation to the last issue and how (if one exists) it should be resolved.  [7] At present, I do not consider it necessary to receive further evidence about the nature and extent of any use of the relevant land and buildings immediately prior to 1959. But it remains open to counsel for the applicants take a different view if they wish.  [8] If counsel consider a further telephone conference with me would be helpful they may seek one at short notice, by contacting the Registry.  [9] Costs are reserved.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI PIRA O AOTEAROA CA53/2018 [2018] NZCA 214  BETWEEN KARLWILLIAM SCHUTT Applicant AND DEBTBUYERSLIMITED Respondent Hearing: 11 June 2018 Court: Winkelmann, Clifford and Williams JJ Counsel: Applicant in person J Ussher for Respondent Judgment: 25 June 2018at 3.00 pm  JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  A The applicationforan extension of time to appeal is granted.   B We make no order for costs.  REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byWilliams J)  [1] Mr Schutt applies under r 29A of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005 for an extension of time to appeal the judgment of Woodhouse J upholding the claim of Debt Buyers Ltd (DBL) to $373,225.63 plus interest and costs.1 Mr Schutt’snotice of appeal may be read as referring both to that judgment and an earlier judgment of Associate Judge Sargisson. 2 Given that Woodhouse J’s subsequent judgment  1  Debt Buyers Ltd v Schutt [2017] NZHC 2876.   2  Debt Buyers Ltd v Schutt [2016] NZHC 3166, decliningthe respondents’application for summary   judgment in the same proceeding.    SCHUTT vDEBTBUYERS LIMITED [2018] NZCA214 [25 June 2018]  concluded the proceeding,itishisjudgment that isin substanceappealed. The appeal was thus filed 13 days out of time.3  [2] DBL opposes the extension. DBL does not argue that the late filing is a sufficient ground alone to decline the extension. It could hardly have done so in light of the principles set out in Almond v Read. 4 As the Supreme Court in that case made clear, relatively minor breaches of filing deadlines are likely to be forgiven in cases involvingan appeal as of right.5 In this casea13-daybreach is properlyseen as minor as it involvesno particular prejudice to DBL.  DBLresponsibly accepted as much.  [3] Instead DBLargues that theappeal is hopeless onthemeritsand the application should be declined for that reason. But as the Supreme Court said in Almond v Read, applications to extend time for relatively minor breaches are not the place for close assessment of the merits of an appeal. 6 Such arguments will not normally succeed unless the case is very weak or very strong.7 Examples of weak cases offered by the Court were proceedings unwinnable even on unchallenged facts; where there is no jurisdiction to consider the claim; where the appeal is an abuse of process; or the appeal is frivolous or vexatious.8  [4] This appeal is essentially about the correct interpretation of a settlement agreement. It plainly does not meet the description of hopeless from the outset. DBL’s opposition in this respect is misconceived.  [5] Theapplication for an extension of time to appeal is granted accordingly.  [6] As the applicant is self-represented, there will be no order for costs.  3  In his notice of appeal, Mr Schutt said the appeal was filed just one day late, but this is in error.   The judgment was issued on 22 November 2017. The appeal period expired on 20 December   2017.  The notice of appeal and application to extend time were received by this Court on   30 January 2018. Taking into account the Christmas holiday period, this makes it 13 days out of   time.   4  Almond v Read [2017] NZSC 80, [2017] 1 NZLR 801 at [35]–[40].   5  At [37].   6  At [37].   7  At [39(c)].   8  At [39(c)].

[2] The application is supported by a memorandum of counsel, and affidavit of Christine AnneDunn in support. Theaffidavit of Ms Dunn deposes to the fact that she assisted her mother in executing a Will that had been purchased in kit form from a stationery retailer.  [3] At the time of the execution of the Will, the deceased also executed a handwritten document which clearly contained part of her testamentary intentions. That document, which I am satisfied, accurately recorded the testamentary intentions of the deceased, provided forthe deceased’s four grandchildren, Louise Dunn, Mathew Dunn, Michael Voice, and KaseyVoice to receive the sum of $20,000 each and to the balance of the estate to go equally to the deceased’s two daughters, Karen Voice and Christine Dunn.  [4] TheWill kitdocument appointed Karen ElaineVoiceand ChristineAnneDunn as executors and trustees of theWill.  [5] This application was made on a without notice basis on the grounds that the only persons affected by the application was the applicants and their children, who support the application.  [6] I am satisfied that in terms of HCR 7.23, this application is properly bought withoutnoticeand that theapplicants havemadeall reasonable enquiries and taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the application and supporting documents contain all material that is relevant to the application.

[2] Mr Bhullar now seeks I correct that order, which he contends in terms of HCR 11.10(b) “is drawn up so that it does not express what was decided and intended”. Mr Bhullar’s counsel, Richard Pidgeon, implies the terms of the order at [13]areinconsistent withmyearlier discussion ofapossible order at [10];aconsistent order would have stayed the respondent’s stage two disciplinary hearing (stage one having determined Mr Bhullar was in breach of the respondent’s rules).  [3] I doubt HCR 11.10(b) can be relied upon to address contended internal ambiguity in a judgment. That paragraph more naturally refers to the formal order ‘drawn up’in the wake of the judgment. And the cases are clear the rule may not be invoked to improve on, or to permit second thoughts about, the judgment obtained.1 I was at least clear at [12] the Court was not to become engaged in the respondent’s internal administration of its disciplinary procedures, such as the stay then sought.  [4] In any event, the order is clear: pending further order of this Court, the respondent is not to strike Mr Bhullar off its register of members.

Solicitors:  David Niven, Barrister, Auckland Meredith Connell, Auckland  WILSON v NEW ZEALAND POLICE [2018] NZHC 1352 [8 June 2018]  [!] Mr Wilson appeals his sentence on the basis of a straightforward error of arithmetic, the District Court Judge omitting to subtract for time spent in custody prior to sentence. The Crown accepts the error, and does not oppose the appeal.  [2] Mr Wilson seeks an extension of time for the filing of this appeal, on grounds of his mental illness, lack of legal advice, and the interests of justice generally. The extension is not opposed, and is granted in the circumstances.  [3] Mr Wilson pleaded guilty to numerous charges for which he was sentenced to 24 months' imprisonment on 5 July 2017. On 10 October 2017, that sentence was substituted to ten months' home detention, to be served from that date onwards.  [4] In making this substitution, however, the Judge did not factor in the time Mr Wilson spent on remand before he was sentenced -from 14 January 2017 to his sentencing on 5 July 2017, a period of approximately six months.  [5] It is not disputed this was an oversight. In making an order cancelling a sentence of imprisonment and substituting home detention, the Court is required to take into account the portion of the original sentence that remains unserved. 1 Pre­sentence detention -including detention on remand -is deemed as time served.2 The facts of this case are materially similar to Kapa v Police, where Ellis J allowed the appeal and substituted a reduced sentence, taking a "relatively robust approach to the maths".3  [6] I am minded to do similarly.  [7] I allow the appeal.

[2] Theapplication has proceeded onnotice, butunsurprisingly,forthe reasons set out below, no steps have been taken by Loma Payze in opposition and as the first defendants are otherwise the plaintiffs it is appropriate to now determine the application on the papers.   [3] Having considered the application carefully, and in particular reviewing the affidavit of Mr Barraclough filed in support of the application, it is clear that the application should begranted. Theapplication isnecessarybecausethe propertyat 70 Weston Lea Drive is currently vested in Mr Barraclough and Loma Payze, being the former trustees of the Trust. Although Loma Payze has been certified as being mentally incapable and has been replaced as a trustee byAnna Payze (her daughter) and ETH Trustees 2018 Limited, a vesting order under s 52(1)(a) of the Trustee Act 1956 is necessary to transfer the property into the names of the current trustees to enable them to administer the property.  [4] In the circumstances I make the following orders:  (a)  An ordervesting allthat land comprised and described in CTSA6B/912 being an estatein feesimple of 2.0755hectares moreorless, being Lot 6 on Deposited Plan South Auckland 10393 in John Charles Reginald Barraclough of Hamilton, Accountant, Anna Charlotte Payze of Hamilton, Administration Assistant and ETH Trustees 2018 Limited a duly incorporated company having its registered office at Level 3, South Bloc, 19 Knox Street, Hamilton; and   (b)  No order as to costs.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND NELSON REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA   WHAKATO ROHE   CIV-2016-442-78   [2018] NZHC 1272   IN THE MATTER OF The Trustee Act 1956, section 53 of the   Administration Act 1969 and the Family   Protection Act 1955   AND    IN THE MATTER OF An originating application by ROBERT ALAN LANE and ANIS SAS JEAN BAIN in their capacity as trustees and executors of the estate of the late DAVID WAYDE CARSON Trustees  Hearing: On the papers  Counsel: J V Ormsby for the Applicant G F Kelly and K H Lawrence for the Trustees of the Carson estate P F Whiteside QC to assist the Court R J Buchanan for M Sutherland N Laing for Mr Kremmer  Judgment: 31 May 2018  JUDGMENT OF CULL J [Costs decision]  [l] Following the release of my judgment dated 14 December 2017, a joint memorandum of counsel, for the step-son and niece of the deceased, has been filed seeking an order for costs.  [2] Counsel correctly refer to my minute of 13 November 2017, where I indicated that costs would be dealt with at the hearing.  ESTATE OF DW CARSON [2018] NZHC 1272 [31 May 2018]  [3] Following the hearing and as a result of developments since the hearing, I issued my decision on 14 December 2017, omitting costs orders in respect ofthe step­son and niece of the deceased, Mr Kreemer and Ms Sutherland.  [4] Counsel have drawn my attention to the advice given to each of Mr Kremmer and Ms Sutherland to seek independent legal advice, as they were each beneficiaries under the deceased's will. Mr Kremmer and Ms Sutherland decided to abide the Court's decision and did not take an active part in the hearing. Nevertheless, they followed the advice given to them by the solicitors acting for the deceased's estate and their independent solicitors undertook the preparation to provide each of them with ongoing advice and representation.  [5] The costs of the beneficiary parties have been discussed with counsel for the estate and for the trust, who respectively take no opposition to an order being made for costs to be paid by the estate ofthe late Mr Carson in accordance with the scheduled annexed to counsels' memorandum.  [6] Accordingly, I make an order that the costs ofMr Kremmer and Ms Sutherland, as beneficiary parties to this litigation, be paid by the estate of the late Mr Carson, in accordance with schedule annexed to the joint memorandum of counsel, under s 71 of the Trustee Act 1956.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI PIRA O AOTEAROA  CA153/2018 [2018] NZCA 174   BETWEEN  PAUL DOUGLAS Applicant   AND  SUTTER LIMITED Respondent   Counsel:  Applicant in person J Canty (of Sutter Ltd) for Respondent    Judgment: 29 May 2018 at 11 am (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OF ASHER J  (Review of Registrar’s Decision)  A The application for review of the Registrar’s decision is allowed. B The filing fee is waived.  REASONS  [1] On 3 May 2018 Mr Douglas was advised that his application for waiver of the filing fee for his application for special leave to appeal was declined because he had failed to provide information and documents requested by the Registrar. On 4 May 2018 Mr Douglas objected to the Registrar’s refusal to waive the fee. By minute dated 10 May 2018, I ordered that Mr Douglas’objection be treated as an application to review the Registrar’s decision. I encouraged Mr Douglas to file the documents requested by the Registrar to give the review the best chance of success.  He has now done so.  DOUGLAS v SUTTER LIMITED [2018] NZCA 174 [29 May 2018]  [2] The documents filed demonstrate that Mr Douglas is a beneficiary of Work and Income New Zealand. It is therefore appropriate that the filing fee be waived, and I so order. The application for special leave will now be progressed in the usual way.  
IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI PIRA O AOTEAROA  CA118/2017 [2018] NZCA 167  BETWEEN JEREMYJAMES MCGUIRE Applicant  AND THE SECRETARY FOR JUSTICE Respondent  Court: French, Miller, Cooper, Winkelmann and Clifford JJ  Counsel: Applicant in person G L Melvin and M J McKillop for Respondent P N Collins for New Zealand Law Society as Intervener  Judgment: 25 May 2018 at 11.30 am (On the papers)    JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  The application for recall is declined.  REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byCooper J)  [1] In the Court’s judgment of 9 March 2018 there was an order that the applicant pay the respondent costs on the appeal, and costs on the cross-appeal, calculated for a standard appeal on a band A basis and usual disbursements.1  [2] In a memorandum dated 23 March 2018 Mr McGuire takes issue with the award of costs, on two bases. First, he says that the appeal involved the public  McGuire v The Secretary for Justice [2018] NZCA37 at [78].  MCGUIRE vTHE SECRETARYFOR JUSTICE [2018] NZCA167 [25 May2018]  interest, and afull panel was convened tohear it, theNew Zealand Law Societybeing asked to appear as an intervener.  Hesubmits in the circumstances that the usual costs rules were thereby “displaced”. The second issue advanced is that the cross-appeal was filed and served out of time and the Secretary for Justice was granted an indulgence to enable the cross-appeal to proceed.  [3] Counsel for the respondent, by memorandum dated 5 April 2018, challenges both of Mr McGuire’s propositions.  [4] In accordance with the Court’s normal practice, we invited submissions on what costs orders (if any) should be made on disposal of the appeal, at the end of the oral argument. It was then agreed by both counsel that costs should follow the event and that the costs should be calculated for a standard appeal on a band A basis.  [5] Counsel for the respondent suggests that Mr McGuire’s present memorandum effectively amounts to a recall application. It is not so expressed. But if that is what it is intended to be, it is clearly unmeritorious. There is no proper basis upon which we could now purport to make some different order as to costs than the one that was made in the judgment.  [6] Assuming in Mr McGuire’s favour that the memorandum is an application for recall, it is declined.  Solicitors: Crown Law Office, Wellington for Respondent

Publication in Law Report or Law Digest permitted.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Miller J)  [1] This is an application for leave to appeal a decision on an application for change of venue. 1 The Bay of Plenty Regional Council has prosecuted the Rotorua District Council and Waste Management NZ Ltd for discharging a contaminant onto land in circumstances where it may have entered water. Jury trial has been elected.  Judge Thompson accepted an application for change of venue and directed that the trial be held at Hamilton.2 Both defendants have sought leave to appeal.  [2] Since the applications for leave were filed, Crown Law has reviewed the matter and now acknowledges that there was insufficient evidence to warrant transfer.  The Regional Council accordingly now accepts that the appeals should be allowed and the order for transfer quashed.  [3] In the circumstances, we grant leave to appeal and allow both appeals.  The prosecution will return to the Rotorua District Court.  [4] For fair trial reasons, we make an order prohibiting publication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in news media or on the internet or other publicly available database until final disposition of trial.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TE WHANGANUI-A-TARAROHE  CIV-2017-485-1032 [2018] NZHC 1166   UNDER  the Insolvency Act 2 006   IN THE MATTER  of the bankruptcy of Kelvin Smyth   BET WEEN  WHOLESALE CARLIMITED Applicant  S DIRECT (4 x 4)   AND  KELVIN SMYTH Respondent   Hearing:  22 May 2018    Appearances: M Belesky for applicant E Cox for respondent  Judgment: 23 May 2018   JUDGMENT OF ASSOCIATE JUDGE JOHNSTON  [1] On or shortly after 17 January 2018 the respondent served a bankruptcy notice on the applicant. This was based on a judgment originally issued by the District Court at Wellington on 30 October 2017. The applicant of course had 10 working days within which to respond.  [2] On 1 February 2018 the applicant filed and served the application before me, that is to say an application for an order setting aside the bankruptcy notice.  [3] The basis for this application was that the applicant had applied or was intending to a ly for an order setting aside the District Court judgment. It is unnecessary for me to outline the basis for that application. The application for an order setting aside the bankruptcy notice being wholly dependent on the applicant  WHOLESALE CARS DIRECT (4 x 4) LIMITED v SMYTH [2018] NZHC 1166 [22 May 2018]  being successful in having the District Court judgment set aside, the parties have been forced to wait for the District Court to issue judgment. Judge Tompkins issued a judgment dated 7 May 2018. His Honour refused to set aside the original judgment dated 30 October 2017 but entered judgment for a lesser amount, reducing the principal amount of the judgment to $8,353.  [4] The question now is how this Court should deal with the application before it.  [5] Having reviewed the file and had the benefit of submissions from Mr Cox and Mr Belesky, I am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to an order dismissing this application. Equally, however, it seems to me to be appropriate to amend the bankruptcy notice so that it aligns with the District Court judgment upon which it is based.  [6] During the course of the hearing I enquired whether Wholesale Cars Direct was prepared to agree to extend the time during which Mr Smyth will now have to comply with the amended bankruptcy notice. As Mr Cox said to me, there is no need for a formal extension because whilst there may only be a matter of days remaining before the bankruptcy notice period expires, the reality is that Wholesale Cars Direct will not be able to commence proceedings for Mr Smyth's bankruptcy and get those before the Court for some weeks. That should give Mr Smyth ample time to pay the debt or make other arrangements with Wholesale Cars Direct.  [7] Accordingly, I dismiss Mr Smyth's application, and order that the Bankruptcy Notice be reduced to $8,028 (which takes into account payments totalling $325) plus costs of $796.   il~a~[LJ; Associate Judge Johnston  Solicitors: Buckett Law, Wellington for applicant Gibson Sheat, Wellington for respondent

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TE WHANGANUI-A-TARAROHE  CIV-2018-485-259 [2018] NZHC 1161   BETWEEN  ISSO HOLDINGS LIMITED Plaintiff   AND  DENIZE TRUSTEE COMPANY LIMITED First Defendant   JONATHAN PETER TAPLEN DENIZE Second Defendant   Hearing:  22 May 2018    Appearances: D G Dewar for plaintiff No appearance for first defendant Second defendant in person  Judgment: 22 May 2018  JUDGMENT OF ASSOCIATE JUDGE JOHNSTON  [1] This summary judgment application came on for hearing before me today. The proceeding was originally commenced on 22 April 2018 and there is evidence before the Court of service of the originating documentation, together with a notice issued pursuant to s 119 ofthe Property Law Act requiring the defendants to quit the property in question.  [2] Neither of the defendants have taken formal steps to oppose the plaintiff's application for summary judgment or the Property Law Act Notice.  [3] As Mr Dewar submits, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.  ISSO HOLDINGS LIMITED v DENIZE TRUSTEE COMPANY LIMITED [2018] NZHC 1161 [22 May 2018]  [4] However, when the matter was called today the second defendant, Mr Jonathan Denize, was in Court. He had come from Auckland for the purpose. He told me that he does not deny the plaintiff's entitlement to judgment including an order for possession of the property. He says he does not disagree with Mr Dewar's calculation ofthe amount due to the plaintiff. But he says that he is doing everything that he can to raise sufficient funds to meet the judgment, and is understandably anxious to avoid the entry of a judgment for such a large amount of money against the first defendant or himself.  [5] After discussing the matter with Mr Dewar and Mr Denize, I concluded that the most appropriate course was to grant the plaintiff summary judgment, but direct that the judgment lie in Court for a short time in order to give Mr Denize an opportunity to discharge the obligation.  [6] Accordingly, and by consent, I now enter judgment for the plaintiff against the first and second defendants in the amount of $1,609,113.34 which is the amount due and owing as at today's date, together with default interest pursuant to the contract at the rate of 14.75 per cent from today's date so that interest will continue to accrue at the daily rate of $632.43 down to the date of payment, and costs on a solicitor and client basis (as also provided for in the contract) of $10,925 and disbursements of $2,081.75.  [7] I also make an order for possession of the property as sought by the plaintiff.  [8] As already said, that judgment is to lie in Court and not be sealed or otherwise enforced until after 12 June 2018.  Solicitors: Thomas Dewar Sziranyi Letts, Lower Hutt for plaintiff

Registrar / Deputy Registrar  Solicitors: Crown Law, Wellington  Applicant:  CULLEN vTHE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE MINISTRYOF HEALTH [2018] NZHC 1137[21 May2018]  [1] My 20 April 2018 judgment took the preliminary view Dr Cullen should be liable to pay 2B costs to the respondent, including for two counsel, and actual and reasonable disbursements as certified by the Registrar. I reserved costs to be determined on memoranda to be filed in accordance with a specified timetable, if my preliminary view was not accepted by either party and costs could not otherwise be agreed between them.  [2] The Chief Executive seeks $29,680.45 in costs and disbursements, calculated in accordance with my preliminary view. Dr Cullen’s view is unknown. He has not responded to the Chief Executive’s communication of its claim to obtain his agreement. He has not filed anything in response to the Chief Executive’s memorandum, the time for responding to which in accordance with the timetable has expired.  [3] Ihavereviewedthe ChiefExecutive’s claimed costs and disbursements, set out at the Schedule to the Chief Executive’s memorandum. They are a conservative calculation of 2B scale costs in the proceeding.  [4] I order DrCullen to payto the Chief Executive costs and disbursements in the amount of $29,680.45.  —Jagose J

Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date……………  AAPIARUMALAv LOWE [2018] NZHC 1120  [1] The plaintiff has now discontinued his claim in defamation against the defendants.  The only remaining issue is that of costs.  [2] Costs on a discontinuance are governed by r 15.23 of the High Court Rules 2016 which provides as follows:  15.23 Costs  Unless the defendantotherwiseagrees orthe courtotherwise orders, aplaintiff who discontinues a proceeding against a defendant must pay costs to the defendant of and incidental to the proceeding up to and including the discontinuance.  [3] The plaintiff has submitted a lengthy letter in opposition to costs.  Counsel for the defendants has filed a memorandum in response.  In doing so the plaintiff appears to be attempting to relitigate matters that have already been determined by other tribunals. It may be appropriate to engage in a limited examination of the merits in some cases. An example would be where the plaintiff argues that the proceeding has achievedits desiredobject. In thepresent case, however,the plaintiffhas discontinued the proceedingduringthe interlocutoryphase.  There is no reason whyr15.23 should not be applied.  [4] The defendants have been represented throughout by the same counsel. therefore direct that the plaintiff must pay the defendants a single award of costs calculated on a Category 2B basis together with disbursements as fixed by the Registrar.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date: ………………………….  Solicitors: Young&Caulfield, Browns Bay  MACMILLAN v MACMILLAN [2018] NZHC 1060[16 May2018]  [1] I have an application before me for orders requiring the executor of the estate of Duncan Stuart MacMillan to fileatrueand perfect inventoryand an account of that estate. The executor did not appear to oppose the application. I am satisfied that he was on notice of the hearing date and that I should proceed to judgment.  [2] Theapplicant, Daniel Allan MacMillan, is abeneficiaryunder the estate. His solicitors have endeavoured to obtain information from the executor, Stuart Wayne MacMillan, relating to the administration of the estate. Those requests have proven fruitless and hence the present application.  [3] By wayof further background, probate was granted on 20 August 2014. The last Willof Duncan MacMillan isrelativelystraightforward. There are minor gifts for Stuart and Daniel, with the residue of the estate to be shared between them. I am advised byMrYoung, forthe applicant, that Stuart refuses to provide anyinformation about the estate and believes that Daniel is not entitled to receive anything under the Will because of disentitling behaviour. He also advises that an issue has arisen as to whether ornot Daniel is the testator’s son. Mr Young concedes that heis not, but that that makes no difference for the purposes of the application.  [4] As Mr Young also submits, an executor must keep a full account and must provide information to beneficiaries on request.1 Stuart is refusing to provide that information and, accordingly, the order as sought is appropriate.  [5] Thecosts ofthe accounting exercise shallbebornebyDaniel. However, there should be costs on the application on a 2B basis, to be paid by the estate.

This is a long-standing matter and Mr Joyce made a number of points in relation to the circumstances concerning his ability to have contact with G as he perceives them.  Ms Quin filed a memorandum setting out the respondent’s perspective.    1  Joyce v O’Brien [2014] NZHC 964.  I adopt the names used in the judgment of Duffy J.  [3] I raised with Mr Joyce what jurisdiction the High Court now had given the terms of the orders made by Duffy J.  In her judgment she held:2    2  Joyce v O’Brien, above n 1, at [86].  (a) The appellant is to have supervised contact with G once a fortnight for a period of two hours at the local Barnados office;   (b) The above order is to remain in place for six months, after which time the parties have leave to apply to the Family Court for further orders in relation to contact with G; and    The appeal against the order denying the appellant all contact with G for a period of two years is allowed.  That order is set aside.  In its place I order that:  (c) The parties also have leave to return to this Court to resolve any issue regarding the appointed day or time of the supervised contact, or if they are unable to resolve those issues between themselves.  [4] I read out this passage from the judgment, which Mr Joyce did not have with him.  In those circumstances, I explained to Mr Joyce that it seemed that any application of the kind he was making now had to be made to the Family Court, rather than the High Court.  It is now four years since the judgment, and the leave in paragraph [86] (c) relates to the six month period referred to in paragraph [86](b).  Mr Joyce understood the point that I was making.     [5] In the circumstances, I conclude that this Court has no jurisdiction to deal with Mr Joyce’s application, which I accordingly dismiss.

RAZDAN RAFIQ vATTORNEY-GENERAL[2018] NZSC 45 [14 May2018]   REASONS  [1] On 4 December 2017, this Court dismissed an application for leave to appeal made by the applicant for want of jurisdiction.1  [2] The applicant applies for a recall of the judgment. Nothing in his application provides anyproper basisforrecall. In particular, theapplicant incorrectlyasserts this Court has jurisdiction to deal with his application forleave to appeal.  For the reasons given in the judgment to which the present application relates, that is incorrect.  [3] There are no grounds to recall the judgment and the application is therefore dismissed.

B The applicant is topay the respondent costs of $2,500.  REASONS  [1] The applicant applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal out of time against the dismissal in the High Court of an application to set aside a bankruptcy notice1 and sought awaiver inrespect of the filingfee. Thiswas refused bythe Deputy Registrar. His application to review that decision was dismissed by Brown J.2 He now seeks leave to appeal to this Court against the decision of Brown J.  1 Prescott v New Zealand Police [2017] NZHC 2701 (Associate Judge Bell). 2 Prescott v New Zealand Police [2018] NZCA16.  PETER RICHARD PRESCOTT v NEWZEALAND POLICE [2018] NZSC 43 [9 May2018]  [2] The point which the applicant wishes to advance is that he is not a “person” and thus not subject to the InsolvencyAct 2006. We do not propose to engage with this argument, save to saythat it is self-evidently wrong.  [3] Theapplication for leave toappeal is dismissed as is afurther document which the applicant has filed, styled “[a]pplication as of right to have the judgment of Associate Judge Bell set aside under the doctrine on ex debito justitiae”.

[2] The application for an injunction is dismissed. The plaintiffs have not demonstrated an arguable case. The balance of convenience lies in favour of the defendant and declining injunctive relief is consistent with the overall interests of justice.  [3] A reasons judgment will follow shortly.  [4] Costs are reserved and will be timetabled as part of the reasons judgment.  Hinton J 
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  I TE KOTI PIRA O AOTEAROA  CA550/2017 [2018] NZCA 142   BETWEEN  YAO WEI HE Applicant   AND  ZHIXIONG CHEN Respondent   Court:  French, Cooper and Winkelmann JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person N R Campbell for Respondent    Judgment: 7 May 2018 at 11.00 am (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The applicant is ordered to pay the respondent costs in the sum of $2,676.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by French J)  [1] The respondent seeks costs against the applicant. This follows the latter’s withdrawal of an application he had filed for an extension of time to appeal under r 29A of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005.  [2] The respondent who had opposed the application seeks increased costs. He does so on the grounds that the applicant has acted unreasonably in the conduct of the litigation causing delay and putting the respondent to unnecessary expense.  HE v CHEN [2018] NZCA 142 [7 May 2018]  [3] For his part, the applicant says no costs should be payable. The only reason he withdrew his application was his inability to obtain legal representation. Nevertheless, the fact remains that he filed an application which he later abandoned on the eve of the hearing, having breached timetabling orders. There is in our view no reason to displace the ordinary rule that costs should be payable.  [4] As to the quantum of those costs, we acknowledge there appear to be grounds for increased costs. However shortly before the applicant withdrew his application, the respondent’s instructing solicitor advised him that on withdrawal the respondent would be seeking payment of scale costs amounting to $2,676. There is no evidence of any further work being undertaken by the respondent between the date of that advice (Friday 9 March 2018) and the filing of the notice of abandonment (Tuesday 13 March 2018).  [5] In those circumstances we consider that only scale costs should be awarded.  Accordingly the applicant is ordered to pay the respondent costs in the sum of $2,676.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEWZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TAMAKI MAKAURAU ROHE  CRI-2017-090-1504 [2018] NZHC 964  THE QUEEN   v   ANDREW GRAHAM WAI-POI   Hearing:  4 May 2018   Appearances:  S L McColgan for the Crown   J G Krebs for Mr A G Wai-Poi   Judgment:  4 May 2018    ADDENDUMTO SENTENCING NOTES OFPOWELL J  Solicitors: Crown solicitor,Auckland Counsel: J Krebs, Shakespeare Chambers, Napier  R vWAI-POI [2018] NZHC 964 [4 May2018]  [1] Following the sentencing of Mr Wai-Poi this morning it was brought to my attention by the Registry that the sentence imposed, nine months of community detention, in fact exceeded the permissible period for communitydetention set out in s 69B(2) the Sentencing Act 2002. As the sentence imposed could not by law be applied to Mr Wai-Poipursuant to s180(1) ofthe Criminal ProcedureAct 2011, Ihave recalledMrWai-Poiand counsel to explain the situation,and followingthediscussion this afternoonhaveformallyrecalled the sentenceimposed onMr Wai-Poiandinstead substituted a new sentence of six months community detention, together with nine months intensive supervision.   [2] The intensive supervision component of the sentence is imposed in the knowledge that Mr Wai-Poi is currently serving a sentence of intensive supervision. The intention is when his current sentence of intensive supervision comes to an end intensive supervision willcontinuetorununtil the expiryof nine months from today’s date.   [3] In myview, giventhe reasons set out in mysentencing notes with regard to the appropriateness of community detention as the primary sentence for Mr Wai-poi, it seems to me that any other sentence other than the new sentence that I have now imposed would be manifestly excessive,anddefeat the purposes of rehabilitation that were identified so stronglythis morning.

REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks a recall of our judgment of 8 February 2018,1 dismissing hisapplication forleaveto appeal againstajudgment of the Courtof Appeal.2 In doing so hecontends that the reliance byVenningJ in the High Court3 on dictain Nicholls v Registrar of the Court of Appeal4 was erroneous given the approach the PrivyCouncil took to that case in R v Taito. 5 As well, he adopts and re-advances thesubmissions he  1  Nuku v District Court at Auckland [2018] NZSC 7.   2  Nuku v The District Court at Auckland [2017] NZCA471 (Cooper, Brown and Clifford JJ).   3  Nuku v The District Court at Auckland [2016] NZHC 2237.   4  Nicholls v Registrar of the Court of Appeal [1998] 2 NZLR 385 (CA).   5  R v Taito [2002] UKPC 15, [2003] 3 NZLR 577.    KARLTEANGIOTAU NUKU v DISTRICTCOURTATAUCKLAND [2018] NZSC39 [3 May2018]  made in support of his original application and takes issue with aspects of the reasons provided in our February 2018 judgment.  [2] Nothing has been advanced which warrants recall. We consider that the particular remarks in Nicholls which were relied on by Venning J were not subject to adverse comment in Taito. More importantly, as the judgment of 8 February 2018 noted, the basis upon which the High Court and Court of Appeal approached the applicant’s judicial review proceedings was as favourable to the applicant as could have been plausibly contended for. As well, we do not see the recall jurisdiction as engaged by what in substance is no more than an attempt to relitigate the reasons provided and the conclusion reached in the judgment of 8 February 2018.

Copy to:  Applicant  AR vIMMIGRATIONAND PROTECTIONTRIBUNAL[2018] NZHC 923 [3 May2018]  [1] On 4 December 2017, I dismissed AR’s application for leave to appeal my earlier judgment of 24August 2017.1 On 13 December 2017, the Crown sought (2B) costs of $5,746.50 in relation to that dismissal.2  [2] AR has done nothing in relation to the application. On 26 March 2018, the case officer reminded AR his response was due in January 2018. AR told the case officer hewould “speak to his lawyer” and “fileareplynext month”. AR did not have a lawyer at any stage of the proceedings; the reference may well be to his McKenzie friend. In any event, April came. Andwent. Iremain withoutsubmissions from AR on costs.  [3] The Crown was successful in resisting the application for leave to appeal.  So, it is presumptively entitled to costs. Nothing exists to displace that presumption. Themere factAR sought refugee status is not sufficient.3  [4] Costs are awarded to the Crown of $5,746.50.  ……………………………..

[2] Thefirst and second defendants proposed that $57,997.97 of the costsawarded should remain in their solicitor’s trust account pending determination of the appeal, with the remaining $30,000 to be released to them. My order on the stay application was to that effect.4  [3] The first and second defendants made their proposal in [2]  above prior to the plaintiffs filingtheirapplication. In myjudgment of 18 April 2018, Iawarded costs on the unsuccessful stay application to the first and second defendants.5  [4] The parties have now filed a joint memorandum setting out agreed costs of $4,683.00, together with disbursements of $110.00, making a total $4,793.00.

The defendant is a police officer then charged with assault with intent to injure. He was not on duty at the time.  [2] Subsequent to the decision, the defendant has pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of common assault. There will be an application for a discharge without conviction. If granted, permanent name suppression will also be sought.  U v POLICE [2018] NZHC 795 [24 April 2018]  [3] It is sufficient at this point to observe that the District Court has accepted the discharge application is a tenable application. That is not to say it will succeed, but nor is it by any means fanciful.  [4] Sentencing is set for June. In the circumstances, I consider the appropriate course is to allow the appeal and grant interim name suppression until sentencing. That will allow the District Court to consider all matters. The granting ofinterim name suppression is intended to be completely neutral in its effect on the forthcoming applications.  [5] The Crown did not oppose this course, given the short timeframe. It was otherwise opposing the appeal, and would have continued to do so had matters remained unchanged.  [6] The appeal is allowed. The defendant's name is suppressed until sentencing of which time it becomes a matter for the District Court to determine whether final name suppression is granted.   Simon France J 
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY  I TE KQTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TE WHANGANUI-A-TARAROHE CIV-2018-485-233 [2018] NZHC 768  IN THE MATTER of Section 14 of the Wills Act 2007  IN THE ESTATE  ofDullabh Rama ofAuckland, Retired,   Deceased   Hearing:  On the papers   Judgment:  23 April 2018     JUDGMENT OF CULL J  [1] The executor and trustee, Mr Govan applies for orders, on a without notice originating application, declaring a will dated 23 June 2017, to be a valid will under s 14 of the Wills Act 2007.  [2] Mr Govan has filed a substantive affidavit setting out the circumstances in which the deceased signed his new will on 23 June 201 7. Mr Govan assisted the deceased, by arranging for the signing ofhis new will in the presence oftwo witnesses. He contacted two Justices of the Peace to go to the deceased's home to witness the signing of his will but they were unable to go to the deceased's home together at the same time. As the deceased was unable to walk properly and needed assistance, Mr Govan's mother took the deceased to see a Justice of the Peace and the deceased duly signed his new will in the presence of that Justice of the Peace on 23 June 2017.  [3] Two days later, on 25 June 2017, arrangements were made for another Justice of the Peace to go to the deceased's home to witness the deceased's new will. The Justice of the Peace duly placed his signature on the new will as the second witness.  ESTATE OF DULLABH RAMA [2018] NZHC 768 [23 April 2018]  [4] When the deceased's will was taken to his solicitors, Mr Govan was later advised by the lawyers that the deceased's will needed to be witnessed by two witnesses present together at the same time in the deceased's presence when the deceased signed his will.  [5] The deceased died before there could be further arrangements for him to have his will signed and witnessed by two witnesses together.  [6] The beneficiaries of the deceased's will are his five daughters, who all consent to Mr Govan's application, to have the deceased's will to be declared a valid will.  [7] I am satisfied that the will of the deceased dated 23 June 2017, expresses the deceased's testamentary intentions. I declare that the Will dated 23 June 2017, is a valid will, despite the fact that the two witnesses to the will were not present at the same time, in the deceased's presence, when the deceased signed his will.

REASONS  [1] Mr Whichman moves for bail pending his appeal against conviction for injuring with intent to injure (2), threatening to kill, and assault with a weapon.  [2] The convictions resulted from guilty pleas entered at trial. Mr Whichman says they were entered under a misunderstanding, caused by trial counsel, about the length of the effective sentence that would result. He says that he protested at the time, trying to withdraw his pleas, but the judge refused to hear him. He accuses the judge, counsel and court staff of misconduct.  WHICHMAN v R [2018] NZCA 85 [10 April 2018]  [3] Admission to bail pending appeal is exceptional;  the onus is on the applicant, and the starting point is that the conviction should be assumed sound.  [4] The merits of this appeal are not so obviously strong as to warrant bail in the interests of justice. It may perhaps be that a mistake was made about the effective sentence, but Mr Whichman did plead guilty, and he did so after the victim had given evidence at trial.  [5] Timing considerations are neutral. The sentence of four years expires in June 2020.  [6] Mr Whichman raises other considerations; he wants to break with his gang connections and study at university, and to support his parents financially. Rehabilitative and social considerations of this kind are better addressed at a parole hearing, as is the suitability of the proposed address. Mr Whichman is eligible for parole, though he waived his right to seek it at the last opportunity.  [7] The application for bail is dismissed.

[2] The application was made on the grounds that Colin Norman Gordon, the current trustee, was incapable of acting as trustee having lost capacity and was incapable of understanding the nature of the application.  JONATHAN MARK GORDON AS TRUSTEE OF THE GORDON FAMILY TRUST [2018] NZHC 599  [3] On 1 February 2018, Ellis J issued a minute pointing out deficiencies in the application and requiring evidence to be filed on a number of issues including confirmation as to the existence of beneficiaries and the fact that the property in question was trust property.  [4] On 15 February 2018, an affidavit of Jonathan Mark Gordon dated 8 February 2018 was filed. This affidavit addressed the various evidential issues raised in the Minute of Ellis J.  [5] The affidavit of 8 February 2018 was accompanied by a memorandum of counsel dated 15 February 2018 explaining the procedural history of this matter.   Decision   [6] Having reviewed the documentation now filed, I am satisfied that Colin Norman Gordon is incapable of acting as a trustee having lost capacity and that it is appropriate for him to be removed and that service on him is not required.  [7] I am satisfied that the documentation now before the Court contains all the relevant information required by the Court to make the order sought.  [8] Accordingly, an order is made pursuant to s 52 ofthe Trustee Act 1956 vesting title to the land contained in Certificate ofTitle NL 9C/475, being a property situated at 21 Hunt Street, Wakefield in the names ofJonathan Mark Gordon and Susan Gordon as trustees of the Gordon Family Trust.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  CA624/2017 [2018] NZCA 68  BETWEEN ANTHONY KARAURIA JACKSON Appellant  AND MINISTRY OF PRIMARYINDUSTRIES Respondent  Hearing: 1 March 2018 Court: Gilbert, Simon France and Whata JJ Counsel: Appellant in person  E J Hoskin for Respondent Judgment: 22 March 2018 at 2.30 pm    JUDGMENT OFTHE COURT  The application forleave to bring a second appeal is declined.  REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given byWhata J)  [1] Mr Jackson pleaded guilty to a charge of obtaining a benefit by selling fish in circumstances where he had no licence to do so.  The offending involved in the order of 250 kilograms of minced paua with a black-market value of $18,890 and approximately 43 litres of kina roe, valued at $3,472. He was sentenced by Judge Ingram to 12 months’ home detention and 300 hours’ community work.1  Police v Jackson [2017] NZDC 11268.  JACKSON v MINISTRYOF PRIMARYINDUSTRIES [2018] NZCA68 [22March2018]  Heappealed against conviction and sentence. Thisappeal was dismissed byHeath J. 2 He now seeks leave to bring a second appeal.  [2] Mr Jackson claims he had the permission of the local hapu to fish off Motiti Islandin accordancewith tikangaMaori. He contends regulation of fishingoff MotitiIsland is in astateof flux and, within the correspondingvacuum, the tikangaof his hapu prevailed. Hesays the Courts below werewrongto dismissthese claims and he seeks leave to present further oral and written evidence in support of them.  [3] Mr Jackson’s intended appeal does not raise a matter of general or public importance, nor risk a miscarriage of justice if left unaired. The appeal against conviction has no prospect of success. There is nothing before us to suggest MrJackson did not fully appreciate the merits of his position when he pleaded guilty.  As to sentence, Mr Jackson was afforded an opportunity to present his argument and evidence in support of his tikanga-based claims to Judge Ingram and then to Heath J. His arguments were carefullyconsidered by them. In rejectingthose arguments, both Courts referred to letters of advice from local iwi and hapu organisations deprecating Mr Jackson’s actions as breaching tikanga.3 We see no flaw in their reasoning.  [4] Accordingly, the application for leave to bring a second appeal is declined.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2015-485-000223 [2018] NZHC 507  BETWEEN THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL Plaintiff  AND INSTITUTION OF PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS NEW ZEALAND INCORPORATED First Defendant  AND ALAN MICHAEL REAY Second Defendant  Hearing: 27 April 2017  Appearances: K G Stephen and I M G Clarke for Plaintiff and First Respondent HJ P Wilson and M J Neill for First Defendant and Second Respondent W J Palmer and O D Peers for Second Defendant and Applicant  Judgment: 22 March 2018  COSTS JUDGMENT OF WILLIAMS J  Final Ruling and Orders  [1] On 8 March 2018, Dr Reay's counsel filed a memorandum advising that the pmties could not agree on costs. The memorandum also advised that Dr Reay seeks costs on a 2B basis plus disbursements against the Attorney-General and Institute of Professional Engineers New Zealand Incorporated (!PENZ). This results in costs of $12,934.00 plus disbursements of $1728.21.  [2] On 16 March 2018, the Attorney-General and IPENZ's counsel filed a memorandum accepting that costs on a 2B basis but seeking a reduction in Dr Reay's costs award in the following two respects:  THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL v INSTITUTION OF PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS NEW ZEALAND INCORPORATED [2018] NZHC 507 [22 March 2018]    (a)  $892.00 in relation to a memorandum dated 29 May 2017; and   (b)  one third to recognise that Dr Reay was not successful in respect of the privilege element ofthe argument and that a large portion ofthe hearing was spent establishing the existence of legal advice after it was made clear that this was unnecessary.    [3] I set out briefly my view as follows:  (a)  Having reviewed the document of 29 May 2017, I do not accept that costs are justified in respect of it. The memorandum was no more than a placeholder.   (b)  I do not accept that a deduction of one third of the total costs is warranted. It is clear that a successful party is entitled to full costs where the plaintiff succeeded in the essential step of the argument, in this case, waiver. 1    [4] Dr Reay is accordingly entitled to costs of $12,042.00 and disbursements of $1728.

His trial is duetocommencein this Court on 30 July 2018.  [2] MrYad-Elohim is currently detained at the Mason Clinic under the provisions of ss 30 and 45 of the Mental Health (CompulsoryAssessment and Treatment) Act 1992 (theAct). Even if EM bail was granted, hewould remain subject to detention under the Act. It is not currently known when he is likely to be discharged. If discharged, he would return to custody unless EM bail was granted.  [3] If granted EM bail, Mr Elohim plans to reside at a facility run by the Grace Foundation. Anaffidavitfiled in supportof the application from afull-timevolunteer at the Grace Foundation confirms that the Foundation has no issues with Yad-Elohim residing at the facilityon EM bail. Hesays that otherpeople at the residence are on EM bail, and that the facility would be able to provide Mr Yad-Elohim with 24-hour support.  [4] There are obviously significant risks with any grant of EM bail. It would be essential for Mr Yad-Elohim to take his medication as prescribed. Even then, there must be a risk that his acknowledged psychosis will place other residents of any facilityat risk.   [5] Iconsider itprematureat this pointto grant Mr Yad-Elohim EM bail. Anysuch decision would need to bemadeat the pointheis discharged under the Act. TheCourt can then assess the risk factors based on his condition at that time and the proposals formanagingsuchrisk.

(b)  the time for an appeal pursuant to r 20.4(b) of the High Court Rules 2016 (20 working days) expired on 19 December 2017, a date before the release of the judgment to counsel.    Bhamidipati v Bhamidipati [2017] NZFC 7991.  BHAMIDIPATI v BHAMIDIPATI [2018] NZHC 481 [20 March 2018]   [3] The appeal from a decision of the Family Court under the Prope1ty (Relationships) Act 197 6 is under s 3 9(3) ofthat Act. It incorporates the provisions of the High Comt Rules relating to appeals. That section does not limit the time prescribed for bringing the appeal.  [4] The applicant has filed an affidavit in support of the application. He annexes a copy ofthe email sending the Family Comt decision to his solicitors on 20 December 2017, together with a further email exchange of the same day with the Family Court registry. It appears clear that the delay of almost a month in releasing the decision was  due to an administrative oversight.  [5] The respondent takes a neutral stand in relation to this application.  [6] In those circumstances and given that the application for leave to extend time was filed on 29 January 2017 ( dated 19 January 2018) it appears appropriate the extension should be granted.  [7] It was clearly out of the hands of either patty and the cause of the delay for  filing the appeal is entirely down to an administrative oversight on the pait of the  registry.  [8] Accordingly, I grant special leave to extend the time prescribed for appealing the judgment of the Family Court dated 21 November 2017. As the matter was put in the call over list for 5 March 2018 it has taken some time to come before the Court. Accordingly, the time for appeal is extended to 20 working days from the date of this  order.  [9] As neither party has contributed in any way to the cause leading to the  application I do not propose to make a costs order in relation to t application at this stage.

The effect ofa stay would be that Mr Stafford's caveat over ACC's property would remain in force pending further order ofthe Court ofAppeal.  ACCIDENT COMPENSATION CORPORATION v STAFFORD [2018] NZHC 429 [14 March 2018]  (2) An application by ACC to recall part of my judgment of 22 February 2018. That application was designed to have Mr Stafford's caveat removed before 22 March 2018. ACC also sought an order that Mr Stafford be required to provide an undertaking as to damages if his application for a stay was granted.  [2] I have advised counsel I cannot give reasons for my judgment for some time. The issues raised by both applications require urgent determination.  [3] The result of the applications is:  (1)  Mr Stafford's application for a stay is granted. His caveat will remain in place until further order of the Court ofAppeal.   (2)  I make no order concerning an undertaking as to damages.   (3)  The outcome of the stay application renders it unnecessary for me to address ACC's recall application.    [4] I make no order as to costs in relation to the applications I have heard on 14 March 2018.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA159/2016 [2018] NZCA 29  BETWEEN  COLLINS & MAYLAW Appellant   AND  HARRY MEMELINK AND PATRICK JOHN RENSHAWAS TRUSTEES OF THE LINK TRUST (NO 1) First Respondent   HARRY MEMELINK Second Respondent   Court:  Miller, Simon France and Toogood JJ   Counsel:  H M Twomey and M O Fee forAppellant Q S Haines for Respondents   Judgment:  1 March 2018 at 11.00 am    (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The respondents must pay the appellant costs for a standard appeal on a band A basis and usual disbursements.   REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Miller J)  [1] TheCourt has received counsels’memoranda on costs, which were reserved at the hearing.   COLLINS & MAYLAWv MEMELINK&ANOR [2018] NZCA29 [1March2018]  [2] Theappellant was successful and is entitled to costs forastandard appeal on a band A basis with usual disbursements on the appeal and cross-appeal.  [3] There is a question whether the appellant should recover costs for various interlocutory matters concerning the payment of security for costs on therespondents’ cross-appeal. These costs were incurred as part of the appeal proceeding to hearing and are properly recoverable. However, recovery should be based on band Aof Schedule 2 to the Court’s rules, meaning that 0.4 days should be allowed forall the items claimed.  [4] Finally, the appellant has requested that the Court certify for second counsel.  We decline to do so.   [5] The appellant may seal judgment for costs accordingly, and costs may be deducted from security held for the cross-appeal.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  CA638/2017 [2018] NZCA 30  BETWEEN  JEREMYJAMES MCGUIRE Applicant   AND  NEW ZEALAND LAW SOCIETY Respondent    Counsel: Applicant in Person  Judgment: 1 March 2018 at 2.30pm (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OFCLIFFORD J (Review of Registrar’s Decision)   The application for review of the Registrar’s decision to waive filing fees is declined.  [1] Mr McGuire is appealing a decision of the High Court upholding a finding of unsatisfactory conduct made against him by the Canterbury Westland Standards Committee. At the time of filing his notice of appeal, Mr McGuire also applied for a waiver of the filingfees for both his appeal and an associated application forleaveto adduce further evidence.  [2] The Registrar declined that application. In doing so, she determined that neither of the conditions foundin reg 5(2)(b) of theCourt of Appeal Fees Regulations 2001(the Fees Regulations) were satisfied.  [3] MrMcGuirehas appliedforthat decision to bereviewed by aJudgeof this Court.  In doingso, hehas asked that theCourt giveconsideration to also waivingthe  MCGUIRE v NEWZEALAND LAWSOCIETY[2018] NZCA30 [1 March2018]  setting down fee for his appeal. At this stage, it does not appear that any application has been made. An application must be made and a decision given, before MrMcGuirecan review it.  [4] Regulation 5 of the Fees Regulations provides thataRegistrar maywaive afee payable if the applicant is unable to paythefeeor theproceedingconcerns amatterof genuinepublicinterest and is unlikelyto becommenced or continued unless the feeis waived.  [5] MrMcGuire accepts that the first ground is not available to him. His application is therefore based on a combination of the propositions that his appeal concerns a matter of genuine public interest and is unlikely to be commenced or continued unless the fee is waived.  [6] The two requirements are cumulative. Mr McGuire has confirmed that, irrespectiveof whether thesefees arewaived, hewill continuewith his appeal. Heis, as hehas put itto the Registrar, “readyto go”. Whetheror not his appeal concerns a matter of genuine public interest, as to which I have considerable reservations, there is no basis upon which the Registrar may waive the fees.   [7] The application for a review of the Registrar’s decision declining to waive filing fees is declined.  Clifford J  
' 1­ IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2016-485-514 [2018] NZHC 300  BETWEEN PATRICK JEFFREY EDWARDS Applicant AND ATTORNEY-GENERAL Respondent Hearing: 24 & 28 February 2017 Counsel: E T Midlane for Applicant R Roff and I S Auld for Respondent Judgment: 1 March 2018  JUDGMENT OF WILLIAMS J  Final Ruling and Orders  [1] On 21 February 2018, the Attorney-General filed a memorandum advising the parties could not agree final quantum. Counsel then set out VANZ's proposed approach to assessing quantum which resulted in an award of $366,524.03 plus costs (which were agreed).  [2] In a memorandum dated 21 February 2018, Mr Edwards' counsel advised he disputed three aspects ofthe assessment. In a further memorandum dated 23 February 2018, Mr Edwards contested the basis of the Secretary's s 23 War Pensions Act 1954 (the Act) assessment undertaken in 2000-2001.  [3] It is unnecessary for me to rehearse these matters in any detail. Instead I set out briefly my view as follows:  (a) I do not accept the suggestion that the additional s 23 pension of 10 per cent, granted as from 1 July 1989, should be increased to 60 per cent from the date of s 23 assessment in 2000-2001. This is because:  EDWARDS v ATTORNEY-GENERAL [2018] NZHC 300 [l March 2018]  (i)  Mr Edwards was assessed for a s 23 pension in July 2000 and June 2001 and a 10 per cent increase was found to be appropriate in both assessments. VANZ holistically assessed his quality of life. I am in no position in an application for judicial review to substitute my view for that ofVANZ, even if I agreed with Mr Edwards' submissions.   (ii)  In any event, this particular challenge was not raised by Mr Edwards in his application for judicial review. The focus of the review was on the correct back payment date, not on the s 23 entitlement. I therefore doubt I have jurisdiction to make the adjustment argued for anyway.    (iii) VANZ's approach has been to apply pension rates in 2017 dollars to the entire period 1966 to 2000. This has a benevolent effect. Any issue over the s 23 pension must be considered in the round and balanced against the benefit that Mr Edwards has derived from VANZ adopting 2017 pension rates in its calculations.  (b) VANZ deducted $25,475.48 to account for the pension already paid to Mr Edwards over the period of 8 October 1997 to 29 November 2000. VANZ was correct to deduct this sum. It was not, as Mr Edwards seems to misapprehend, a deduction for overpayment.  Result  [4] I am satisfied that the quantum proposed by VANZ is appropriate in the circumstances. I make that award accordingly together with costs as agreed.  Solicitors: Legal Consultants Limited, Auckland for Applicant Crown Law, Wellington for Respondent

REASONS  [1] Mr Harding has previously been declined bail pending appeal.1 He now reapplies, asserting a change of circumstances.  [2] There is however nothing new about the circumstances advanced. They amount to a claim that he pleaded guilty under duress and the Crown case was never strong enough to sustain a conviction. He repeats his previous claim that without bail he cannot prepare for his appeal.  Harding v R [2018] NZCA 1.  HARDING v THE CROWN [2018] NZCA 21 [26 February 2018]  [3] I accept that Mr Harding is now in a position where his conviction appeal may proceed on an unrepresented basis. Nonetheless, that fact does not justify a grant of bail. It is for the prison authorities to provide Mr Harding with such assistance as he reasonably needs to communicate with any witnesses he intends to call and otherwise prepare for his appeal.  [4] The application for bail is declined.  Solicitors: Crown Law Office, Wellington for Respondent

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Date……………  15HOPETOUN LIMITED v VISSER [2018]NZHC 220 [22February2018]  [1] Issues of costs arise as a result of the applicant successfully applying to set aside the respondent’s statutory demand.   [2] Thestatutorydemand had been served followingentryof judgment againstthe applicant in the District Court forasum of$45,199.30. Therespondent’s application for summary judgment had been opposed in the District Court.  [3] Two days after that judgment the respondent’s solicitors demanded payment of the judgment sum within two days. Two days thereafter the respondent issued a statutory demand seeking payment of the judgment sum. An application to set aside the demand was filed and served and at the same time an appeal against the District Court judgment was lodged.  [4] The respondent took no steps to oppose the setting aside application.   [5] In theCourt’s view the solicitors letterof demandand the issueof the statutory demand occurred at a time when the respondent did not have reasonable cause to believe the applicant was insolvent. The respondent’s actions were therefore pre­emptive.  Hisdecision not to oppose the setting aside application was appropriate but does not vindicate the actions earlier taken.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TE WHANGANUI-A-TARA ROHE CIV-2015-485-611680 [2018] NZHC 212  IN THE ESTATE OF ANTTI MATIAS NURMELA  Hearing: On the papers Judgment: 21 February 2018   JUDGMENT OF GRICE J  [1] The applicant is the administrator of the estate of Antti Matias Nurmela, pursuant to a grant of letters of administration dated 12 October 2015, made under s 9 A(2) of the Administration Act 1969 ( the Act) to the attorney of a person entitled, who has become mentally incapable.  [2] The person entitled who became mentally incapable, Hely Siru Nurmela, died on 22 April 2016. The applicant is the sole surviving executor under the last will and testament ofHely Siru Nurmela.  [3] The applicant filed an application under s 9B(2) of the Act for the Court's directions and Brown J made the following orders:  (a)  the applicant is to continue to act as administrator upon the letters of administration of the estate of the deceased, Antti Matias Nurmela, dated 12 October 2015 for a period of a further six months;   (b)  leave is reserved to the applicant to apply to extend the period of his administration if circumstances so require.    IN THE ESTATE OF ANTTI MATIAS NURMELA [2018] NZHC 212 [21 February 2018]    [4] On 1 August 2017 Justice Cull made further as follows:  [6] In the circumstances, with the proceedings still extant, a further extension of a grant of letters of administration is required and I accordingly make an order in terms of the without notice of application for directions in the following terms:  (a)  the court directs the applicant to continue to act as administrator upon the letters of administration of the estate of the deceased, Antti Matias Nurmela, dated 12 October 2015 for a period of a further six months;   (b)  leave is further reserved to the applicant to apply to extend the period of his administration if circumstances so require.    [5] The applicant has made an application for further time to complete the administration ofthe estate. The proceedings on which the estate is involved have not been resolved. A hearing was scheduled for five days commencing 19 February 2017.  [6] In the circumstances an extension of the administration is appropriate. The application seeks a further 12 months. In the circumstances as the proceedings appear to be nearing completion an order for a further six months extension with leave to further apply appears appropriate.  [7] Accordingly:  (a)  the court directs the applicant to continue to act as administrator upon the letters of administration of the estate of the deceased, Antti Matias Nurmela, dated 12 October 2015 for a period of a further six months;   (b)  leave is further reserved to the applicant to apply to extend the period of his administration if circumstances so require.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA419/2017 [2018] NZCA 13  BETWEEN CHRISTOPHER O'NEILL Applicant  AND KIT TOOGOOD, CECIL HARDING CROUCHER AND MATT AMON Respondents  Court: French, Winkelmann and Brown JJ  Counsel: Applicant in person S M Earl for Respondents  Judgment: 16 February 2018 at 10.15 am (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall of judgment is declined.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Winkelmann J)  [1] On 9 November 2017, this Court issued judgment declining an application by Mr O’Neill to extend the time to appeal a decision of Cull J.1 Cull J had refused Mr O’Neill’s application to recall a judgment of Toogood J in another set of High Court proceedings.2 This Court declined the application for leave on the grounds that Mr O’Neill’s proposed appeal was so fatally flawed that it could not possibly  1  O’Neill v Toogood [2017] NZCA 505.  The judgment of Cull J is O’Neill v Toogood [2017]   NZHC 795.   2  O’Neill v Accident Compensation Corporation [2015] NZHC 2823.    O'NEILLvTOOGOOD [2018] NZCA13 [16February2018]  succeed. Therefore, although the delay had not been great, the application for  extension of time was declined.3  [2] Mr O’Neill now seeks leave to recall this Court’s judgment. The grounds he  advances are as follows:  (a)  the judgment is unsafe and corrupt and was orchestrated to pervert   justice to protect a fellow judge;   (b)  two of the Judges had a conflict of interest which was not disclosed   and was in any case disqualifying; and   (c)  no grounds for the judgment exist.    [3] The test for recall of civil judgments was described by Wild CJ in  Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2) as follows:4  Generally speaking, a judgment once delivered must stand for better or worse, subject, of course, to appeal. Were it otherwise there would be great inconvenience and uncertainty. There are, I think, three categories of cases in which a judgment not perfected may be recalled –— first, where since the hearing there has been an amendment to a relevant statute or regulation or a new judicial decision of relevance and higher authority; secondly, where counsel have failed to direct the Court’s attention to a legislative provision or authoritative decision of plain relevance; and thirdly, where for some other very special reason justice requires that the judgment be recalled.  [4] The grounds Mr O’Neill raises are without substance. But in any case, they  do not constitute grounds for a recall of judgment.  [5] Accordingly, the application for recall of judgment is declined.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA N/A [2018] NZCA 14   BETWEEN  KERRYN MITCHELL Appellant   AND  CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS Respondent    Judgment: 15 February 2018 at 2.30 pm (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OF WINKELMANN J  (Review of Registrar’s decision)  The application for review of the Registrar’s decision to reject the new notice of appeal is declined.  REASONS  [1] On 13 December 2017, the Registrar rejected for filing Ms Mitchell’s proposed appeal on the grounds that the matters raised in it had already been  determined in appeal CA197/2017. Ms Mitchell now seeks to review the Registrar’s  decision.   Background  [2] On 20 October 2017, this Court issued a judgment in an appeal commenced by Ms Mitchell against the Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections.1 Ms Mitchell contended in that appeal that a District Court Judge was without jurisdiction when he imposed special release conditions upon her, more than six months after her sentence had expired.  Mitchell v Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2017] NZCA 475.  MITCHELL v CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS [2018] NZCA 14 [15 February 2018]  [3] The Chief Executive initially challenged this Court’s jurisdiction to hear the appeal, but ultimately accepted that there was jurisdiction to bring such an appeal under s 296 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011. The Chief Executive agreed that the appeal should be treated as an appeal under s 296.  [4] In the judgment dated 20 October 2017 in CA197/2017, leave to appeal under s 296 of the Criminal Procedure Act was granted.2 In the same judgment, the appeal was determined in Ms Mitchell’s favour. The question of law raised on appeal was answered as follows:3  There is no jurisdiction to impose special release conditions under s 94 of the Sentencing Act 2002 beyond the time limits imposed by s 93 of that Act.  Accordingly, Judge Rowe had no jurisdiction to impose special conditions on Ms Mitchell on 29 July 2016 when the relevant sentence expiry date was 2 December 2015.  [5] Ms Mitchell has now sought to file an appeal arguing there was no jurisdiction to impose special release conditions and that Judge Rowe had no jurisdiction to impose special conditions.   Applicationfor review of the Registrar’s decision  [6] In support of her application to review the Registrar’s decision, Ms Mitchell contends that the judgment of 20 October 2017 dealt only with the issue of leave. In this she is mistaken. The judgment both granted leave, and allowed the appeal. The very issues that Ms Mitchell now seeks to raise in this new appeal have therefore already been determined. Accordingly, the Registrar was correct to refuse to accept the appeal for filing on the grounds that the matters Ms Mitchell seeks to appeal have already been determined in appeal CA197/2017. In short, Ms Mitchell already has the relief she seeks. To allow her to pursue this new appeal would be a waste of her time and effort, and would moreover, constitute an abuse of process.  Result  [7] Accordingly, the application for review of the Registrar’s decision to reject the new notice of appeal is declined.  2 At [33]. 3 At [34].

She appointed in her willher daughter, Bronwyn May Williamson, and her son, Warwick David Paul, as her executors and trustees.   [2] Itis now more than three months sinceMrs Paul died. Ms Williamson wants to take probate of the will and to administer the estate. However, Mr Paul has inexplicably failed or refused to take any steps to carry out his duties as executor. Accordingly,Ms Williamson madeapplication to theCourt andobtainedanorder nisi requiring Mr Paul to appear this morning to show cause why probate of Mrs Paul’s will should not be granted to MsWilliamson alone.  [3] Mr Paul has taken no steps at all. He has not responded to correspondence from MsWilliamson or from her lawyers.  I havean affidavit of servicewhich shows that he has all the relevant documents and proper notice of today’s hearing. Mr Paul has filed nothing with the Court, nor communicated with the registry. He has not appeared today.  [4] Mr Adams, who appears for Ms Williamson, makes an oral application that probate be granted to the applicant, Ms Williamson, together with costs and disbursements.  [5] Myjurisdiction in this matter comes from s 19 of the Administration Act 1969.  Itprovides,in summary, that in any casewhereany executor named inawillneglects or refuses to provethe willwithin threemonths from the death of the testator, then the Court may grant anordernisicallingupon theneglectful executor to show causewhy probate of the will should not be granted to the other executor alone. Section 19(2) goes on to provide that upon proof of service of the order, if the executor who is so called upon does not appear the Court maymake such order forthe administration of the estate and as to costs as appears just.  [6] Accordingly,Igrant probate of the will to MsWilliamson alone. Igrant costs as sought in Mr Adams’sscheduleon a1Abasis. Theseareto bepaid out of Mr Paul’s share of theestate.  Brewer J

B Costs of $2,500 are awarded to the respondents.  REASONS  Background  [1] In December 2013the Parish Council of the Avondale Union Parish passed resolutions excluding a group of parishioners (including the applicants) from further use of the Parish’s facilities. This was on the basis that the group had already abandoned its commitment to, and membership of, the Parish.   TUI'IMALO MATAMU vVA'AIMALU SI'ITIA[2018] NZSC 14[14 February2018]  [2] The applicants unsuccessfully challenged the validityof the resolutions in the High Court.1 The Court of Appeal’s decision dismissed the appeal. 2 The applicants seek leave to appeal against the Court ofAppeal decision.   Our assessment  [3] Thearguments the applicants seek to raise essentiallyamount to achallenge to the factual findings of the High Court and in large part repeat the arguments made in the Court of Appeal which were fully considered bythat Court. There are no issues of general public importance. Further, nothing raised by the applicants suggests any risk of a miscarriage of justice.3  Result  [4] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY   CIV 2018-485-99   [2018] NZHC 134   IN THE MATTER  of section 14 of the Wills Act 2007   IN THE MATTER  of the Estate of TERESSA IVOR SILCOCK   incorrectly named in the document as   THERESA IVOR SILCOCK    Hearing: On Papers Counsel: B A Stewart for Applicants Ruling: 14 February 2018  RULING OF SIMON FRANCE J  [1] Mrs Teressa Ivor Silcock died on 25 September 2017. Shortly prior to her death she gave instructions to a law firm concerning a new will. A draft will was prepared in accordance with those instructions. The legal executive who took the instructions completed a written note of the instructions as the appointment progressed. Those notes have been produced. Mrs Silcock died before she could sign the new will. Application is made under s 14 of the Wills Act 2007.  [2] Having read the affidavits/affirmations of Charles Silcock and Bruce Stewart Goint), Christine Harding, and Bruce Stewart, I am satisfied the draft will reflects the deceased's testamentary intentions and those intentions were unchanged at her death.  ESTATE OFT I SILCOCK [2018] NZHC 134 [14 February 2018]  [3] I declare the draft will prepared in September 2017 by the firm of Henderson Reeves Connell Rishworth Limited to be a valid will of Teressa Ivor Silcock.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY  I TE KQTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TE WHANGANUI-A-TARAROHE CIV 2017-406-17 [2018] NZHC 135  BETWEEN BRIAN CYRIL ROWELL Applicant AND DISTRICT COURT First Respondent AND ATTORNEY-GENERAL Second Respondent Hearing: 12 February 2018 (Teleconference) Counsel: Applicant in Person P D Marshall for Second Respondent Ruling: 14 February 2018  RULING OF SIMON FRANCE J  [1] The second respondent applies for a review of the Registrar's decision fixing disbursements at $160 (being recovery of a court fee). The second respondent says the sum is too high. He sought only $139.13 but the Registrar, over the second respondent's wishes, added a GST component. The second respondent says he is only entitled to $139.13 since the Crown Law Office is GST registered. He does not wish to seek from Mr Rowell anything more than that to which he is entitled. The Attorney-General relies on the Court of Appeal decision in New Zealand Venue and Event Management Ltd v Worldwide NZ LLC.1  New Zealand Venue and Event Management Ltdv Worldwide NZ LLC [2016] NZCA 282, (2016) 23 PRNZ 260.  ROWELL v DISTRICT COURT [2018] NZHC 135 [14 February 2018]  [2] Mr Rowell opposes. He submits that the Registrar is bound by reg 24 of the High Court Fee Regulations 2013 which provides:  24  GST included  The fees fixed by these regulations are inclusive ofgoods and services tax.  Mr Rowell submits the Registrar has no choice, and the Court ofAppeal erred when reaching its decision.  [3] In New Zealand Venue and Event Management, the Court ofAppeal stated the GST position as regards costs and disbursements. Disbursements are the same as indemnity costs where the aim is to ensure the successful party is fully reimbursed. Whether GST is added will normally depend on whether the successful party is GST registered. Ifit is, GST is not added.2  [4] The second respondent (through the Crown Law Office) is GST registered. He rightly requested the Registrar to not add GST to the reasonably incurred disbursements. That should have occurred. The Registrar is not obliged to order full recovery over the request of the party seeking recovery for a lesser sum.  [5] There is nothing in the High Court Fee Regulations 2013 that affects this. If the fee is GST inclusive, a person registered for GST, as here, should seek reimbursement of the fee less GST.  [6] The application is allowed. Pursuant tor 14.23 of the High Court Rules 2016 I direct the Registrar to fix the disbursements at $13 9 .13.   Simon France J  At [13]-[18].

[5] I requested that Mr Fletcher provide the original of the will in question to be reviewed by the Court and he has now done that.  [6] No opposition to the application has been received from the respondents.  [7] Having reviewed the documentation filed in this matter, particularly the affidavits of Hilary Rose Clere, Clare Maria Kilmmiin and David Edward Murphy, I am satisfied that the requirements of s 14 of the Wills Act 2007 are met and I hereby declare the document dated 15 May 2009 attached to the affidavit of Hilary Rose Clere dated 7 June 2017 to be the valid will of the late Colin Temple Clere.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors/Counsel: MeredithConnell,Auckland. ME Goodwin,Auckland. RAHarrison, Blenheim.  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE v CATLEY[2018] NZHC 73[8 February2018]  [1] Mr Catley is serving a term of nine years’imprisonment for offences contrary to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 and Arms Act 1983. Mr Harland is serving aterm of six years and eight months’imprisonment in relation to one charge under the Misuse of Drugs Act. All offending was gang-related. The Commissioner of Police, MrCatley and Mr Harland seek approval to settle related action under the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009. Settlements of this nature must be approved by the High Court. And, the Court must approve settlement if satisfied settlement is consistent with the purposes of theAct and the overall interests of justice.1  [2] It is proposed Mr Catleyand Mr Harland wouldforfeit propertyto the valueof approximately$200,000; Mr Harland would be returned not more than $2,941 seized from him on 15 September; and the Commissioner’s application for profit forfeiture orders against both men would be abandoned.  [3] I am satisfied settlement is consistent with the purposes of the Act and the overall interests of justice. Settlement recognises both men derived benefits from significant criminal activity, owned tainted property, or both. However, settlement also recognises the full extent of the Commissioner’s claims may not have been established. More particularly, itis possible MrHarland’s contention the $2,941 cash seized by Police was the proceeds of a sale of a motorbike he had purchased legitimately.  In other words, unconnected to criminal offending.  [4] Orders as per paragraphs 8.1 and 8.2 of the joint memorandum of counsel.  ……………………………..

REASONS  [1] Mr Jackson seeks the suspension of his 12 month sentence of home detention and bail,1 pending the hearing of his application for leave to bring a second appeal.2  [2] The leaveapplication is to be heard on27 February2018.  1 Criminal Procedure Act 2011,s343; andBailAct 2000,s14. 2 Police v Jackson [2017] NZDC 11268; appeal dismissed in Wells v Ministry of Primary Industries [2017] NZHC 1860.  JACKSON v MINISTRYFOR PRIMARYINDUSTRIES [2018] NZCA7 [7February2018]  [3] The threshold for granting bail pending an appeal is a high one. It is only to be granted in exceptional cases.3 I am not satisfied this is an exceptional case. I say that for the following reasons:  (a)  The hearing is now onlythree weeks away.   (b)  Mr Jackson’s claim that he needs bail in order to be able to properly prepare for the hearing is without foundation.   (c)  The prospects of success are weak. The leave application relates to a proposed appeal against conviction and sentence for obtaining a benefit by selling fish without a licence. The conviction followed a guilty plea which of itself creates a significant hurdle. Further, the issues Mr Jackson wants to raise are contrary to settled authority.4    [4] A person seeking suspension of their home detention sentence is required to apply for bail, and thus the application for suspension is treated in a similar way, applying the test relevant to an application for bail.5  [5] The application for suspension of home detention and bail pending appeal is accordingly declined.

One would be a propensity witness. She is an employee who alleges that four days before the incident she was propositioned by Mr Singh in broadly similar circumstances. The other witness is also an employee who will testify as to the rules surrounding the keeping of a bar diary recording significant events. Mr Singh, having been made aware the police  SINGH v NZ POLICE [2018] NZHC 63 [7 February 2018]  were investigating the incident with the complainant, belatedly recorded an entry in the diary. The entry accords with his version of events. The significance of this is in dispute, although it is difficult to see it could have probative value either way.  [3] This ruling concerns bail. A condition of Mr Singh's bail is that he not have contact with these two witnesses. That has the effect of meaning he cannot continue to work at the bar since both women are employed there. Mr Singh applied for that restriction to be removed. The District Court declined. Indeed, it strengthened the proposition by acceding to a police application that Mr Singh be prohibited from entering the bar for any reason (ie as worker or customer). 1 Mr Singh appeals.  [4] On appeal, it is submitted the District Court erred in its assessment that there is a risk of interference with witnesses, and failed to have regard to the impact on Mr Singh's work situation. It seems his work visa is linked to the particular employer. To gain new work he would need to find a new sponsor and obtain a visa variation.  [5] The appeal fails. Whilst I accept contact with the diary witness is of no significance, it is quite different in relation to the proposed propensity witness. She is an important witness. The risk of pressure coming upon her from a defendant who is the bar manager is obvious and the condition is appropriate. I am also of the view that the prohibition of entering the bar is correct. As the evidence stands in its untested state, two women raise issues about Mr Singh using the bar manager position for ulterior purposes. One allegation is of a serious sexual assault. A bail condition which minimises the risk of further incidents whilst preserving Mr Singh's pre-trial liberty is an appropriate balance.  [6] The appeal is dismissed.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA573/2017 [2018] NZCA 4  BETWEEN  ANN LORRAINE NEWALL Appellant   AND  DISTRICT COURTAT MANUKAU Respondent   Court:  Miller and Brown JJ   Counsel:  David Newall in person K Laurenson for Respondent   Judgment:  2 February 2018 at 2.00 pm    (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for an extension of time under r 43 is dismissed.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Miller J)  [1] On 21 December 2017 Mr Newall, who purports to represent his wife Ann, filed an application for extension of time under r 43. He accompanied it with a “request for disclosure” from the defendant, the District Court at Manukau.  [2] The application for extension is based on a claim that the Court has disclosed “their information” to Crown Law but not to Mr Newall. This is misconceived.  MrNewall is not entitled to discoveryon appeal — he can search the court file as of right —nor should he need further information to comply with the rules.  NEWALLvDISTRICTCOURTATMANUKAU [2018] NZCA4[2 February2018]  [3] As Mr Newall is a lay litigant and the proceeding invokes habeas corpus, an extension might ordinarily be granted. But it appears he has brought no fewer than five habeas corpus applications and lacks standing to represent Mrs Newall.  Theinterests of justice do not require an extension.  [4] The application is dismissed, with the result that the appeal is deemed abandoned because Mr Newall did not comply with the rules within the time prescribed.  [5] For completeness, we have had regard to the document filed by Mr Newall titled “Urgent Memorandum/petition to the court for the release of the applicant 29/01/18”. The Registrar is not to accept that document for filing. Habeas corpus applications must be brought in the High Court.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent

REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks a recall of our judgment of 11 December 2017 dismissing his application for leave to appeal from a decision of Asher J in a minute issued on 6 September 2017.1  [2] The application for recall is in substance primarily an attempt to re-argue the application for leave. In addition, the applicant questions the order for costs on the leave application.  [3] Nothing has been advanced which would warrant a recall of our decision not to grant leave.  The order for costs reflected the outcome of the leave application.  de Vries v Bartercard Exchange Ltd [2017] NZSC186.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2016-485-569 [2018] NZHC 29  UNDER the Property (Relationships) Act 197 6  IN THE MATTER Of an appeal against a decision of Judge Coyle made in the Wellington Family Court on 28 June 2016  BETWEEN  GLORIA DACPANO GRAHAM   Applicant   AND  RUSSELL JOHN GRAHAM   Respondent   Hearing:  On the papers   Counsel:  D Milliken for Applicant   M W Anderson for Respondent   Judgment:  30 January 2018    JUDGMENT OF WILLIAMS J (COSTS}  [1] On 5 September 2017, I allowed an appeal against a relationship property decision ofthe Family Court.1 The appellant now seeks costs on a 2B basis of$14,272.  [2] The respondent opposes on two grounds:  (a)  The key issue that determined the appeal was only suggested to the appellant during the appeal hearing. Any costs award should be reduced to reflect that on the grounds initially raised by the appellant in relation to the family home, the Family Court was upheld.   (b)  The appellant was in receipt of legal aid for the appeal. Rule 14.2(f) provides that a costs order should not exceed the actual costs incurred.    Graham v Graham [2017] NZHC 2142. GRAHAM v GRAHAM (COSTS) [2018] NZHC 29 [30 January 2018]  Counsel for the respondent has confirmed that the legal aid costs were $5,142.25.  [3] Ronald Young Jin Taunoa v Attorney-General set out the correct approach in circumstances where the Legal Aid grant was around half or one-third the costs claimed on a Category 2 or 3 basis and where the applicants' success was only partial:2  [43] A resolution of the different views of costs here requires a principled approach. I consider the proper approach here is to identify the proper category and band, calculate the total costs payable on that basis, reduce them by an appropriate percentage, in this case to reflect partial success only, and then compare this figure with the total fees payable to counsel from the Legal Services Board. If the scale fees exceed the Legal Services payment then r 47(f) [the precursor tor 14.2(f)] applies.  [4] Even if I were minded to make some reduction for partial success, costs calculated on a 2B basis would be significantly more than the $5,142.25 actually incurred. For that reason I do not need to consider the first point in any detail. Rule 14.2(f) plainly caps the costs I can award at $5,142.25. I award costs ofthat sum accordingly.  _J~ Jt__  ~--­ Williams J   Solicitors: Cuba Family Law, Wellington for Applicant Thomas Dewar Sziranyi Letts, Wellington for Respondent  2  Taunoa v Attorney-General (2004) 8 HR.NZ 53 (HC).

Ihave consideredthis application inexercise of thepowersconferred unders 333(2)(d)of the CriminalProcedureAct 2011.  [4] The test to be applied to the application is that set out in s 14 of the Bail Act. This section provides that bail must not be grantedunless the Court is satisfied on the balanceofprobabilitiesthatitwouldbeintheinterests ofjusticeintheparticularcase to do so. Theonus is on Mr Hardingto show whybail should be granted.  [5] Mr Harding explains in his letter requesting bail that it is difficult for him to prepareforhisappealwhileheisincustody. Hesaysthathehas been “lockeddown” for 22 hours per day and has only been given one hour per day to access prison facilities.  [6] Bail pending appeal is generally only granted in exceptional circumstances. I am not persuaded that this is one of those rare cases where it would be appropriate to grantbailpendingappeal. The appealagainst convictiondoes not appeartobestrong giventhatMr Hardingpleaded guiltyto thecharges andhavingregardtotheapparent strength of the Crown case summarised in Moore J’s sentencing judgment. Legal aid has been granted for the sentence appeal (although not the conviction appeal). Mr Harding will therefore be assisted by counsel for that part of his appeal. Given the circumstances of the offending, it is inevitable that Mr Harding will be required to servealengthyterm of imprisonment even if his sentenceappeal succeeds.

[2] The proceedings were commenced as a summary judgment application.  However, by consent, that application was withdrawn as the parties had reached a settlement agreement whereby the defendant would make payments towards the outstanding debt due. As part of that settlement agreement, the defendant signed an “admission of judgment” for the sum of $346,863.15, together with solicitor-client costs and interest as at the date of judgment.  [3] The defendant made some payments in accordance with that settlement agreement but defaulted on otherpayments dueand owing. As at 13 September 2017, the outstanding debt owed was $285,223.59.  [4] The defendant has not taken any steps in the proceeding. An order for substituted service was made on 18 June 2014 and service in accordance with those orders was made. Theadmission of judgment was filed afterserviceof theproceeding. In addition, on 20 November 2017, counsel for the plaintiffs emailed a copy of the documents to the defendant and indicated that his instructions were to seek default judgment and, after judgment was entered to commence bankruptcy proceedings.  Counsel for the plaintiffs received a response from the defendant acknowledging that email and suggesting that he would be in contact shortly.   [5] There has been no other communication from the defendant, and he has not taken anysteps in the proceeding. In the circumstances, Ienter judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant for the sum of $285,223.59, plus solicitor-client costs of $5,492.88.  Edwards J

LESLIE McGEACHIN v R [2017] NZSC 193[19 December 2017]  [3] On 31 October 2017 Mr McGeachin filed an application with this Court for a recallof the Court of Appeal judgment dismissinghis appeal against conviction. He also, on 28 November 2017, applied to recall this Court’s judgment of 24 February 2017.  Our assessment  [4] An application to recall the judgment of the Court of Appeal is not an applicationthis Court can deal with.  It must be dealt with by that Court.   [5] Theapplication forrecallof this Court’s judgment essentiallyseeks to relyon similar arguments relating to alleged witness and Crown misconduct as had been earlier put forward both beforethe Court of Appeal and this Court.  Thesearguments have already been fully examined and dismissed.   [6] This means that nothing has been put forward by Mr McGeachin that would justify a recall of this Court’s judgment.

Solicitors: RobWebber&Associates,Auckland SeanKelly Lawyers,Auckland  Counsel: M JMcCartneyQC,Auckland VACrawshaw,Auckland  SN v MN [2017] NZHC 3117 [14December 2017]  [1] This judgment determines an application by SN, that is Mrs N, for costs. I have previously made an order for costs in favour of MN or Mr N, he being the successful party beforeme.  Since I made that order, the Court ofAppeal has allowed Mrs N’s appeal against my judgment but otherwise made no order regarding costs in the High Court.  Chronology  [2] On 5 April 2016, I dismissed Mrs N’s appeal from a decision of Judge DABurns of the Family Court and invited the parties to submit memoranda if they were unable to agree the matter of costs.1 Having received memoranda from counsel, by minute on 13 May 2016, I ordered Mrs N to pay costs on a 2B basis (“order as to costs”). Mrs N has not paid those costs and Mr N has not sought to enforce the order.  [3] On 10 August 2016, the Court of Appeal granted Mrs N leave to appeal on specified grounds (none of which concerned my order as to costs), and said:2  C There will be no order for costs on the application for leave given that the respondent’s opposition was reasonable.   [4] The Court of Appeal heard Mrs N’s appeal on 31 May 2017. Mr N did not appear. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal; made a protection order to take effect from the date of the judgment; stated that, if he wished, Mr N could apply to the Family Court for a discharge of the order; and made no order for costs on the appeal.3 The Court of Appeal’s judgment does not address the issue of costs in the High Court. In fact, there is no suggestion on the face of the judgment or from Ms McCartney that the issue was raised. The Court of Appeal did not quash my order as to costs or remit the matter of costs back to the High Court.  Steps in the High Court following Court of Appeal decision  [5] By memorandum to the High Court dated 31 July 2017, Ms McCartney sought costs for Mrs N on a 2B basis.  1 SN v MN [2016] NZHC 566, [2016] NZFLR 447. 2 SN v MN [2016] NZCA384. 3 SN v MN [2017] NZCA289, [2017] 3 NZLR448.  [6] In response, Ms Crawshaw submitted that my earlier order remained in effect as it had not been quashed by the Court ofAppeal and I had no jurisdiction to rescind that order or make any further order as to costs. Alternatively, if I considered there was jurisdiction, costs were opposed on the ground, amongst others, that the Court of Appeal had not seen fit to make any order as to costs in that Court, whether on the application for leave or the substantive appeal.   [7] I have since received several memoranda from counsel addressing the issue of whether the High Court has jurisdiction to reconsider an earlier award of costs if an appeal against the High Court judgment succeeds. In the usual course of events the issue does not arise because the Court of Appeal will quash the High Court order as to costs and ask the High Court to reconsider the matter of costs. Neither occurred in the present case.   [8] Despite that, Ms McCartney has submitted that the “general approach” is that the High Court will reconsider an earlier order as to costs if its judgment on the merits is overturned.4 Ms McCartney also referred me to several authorities in support of a submission that the Court “commonly reconsiders costs” in the event of a successful appeal to the Court ofAppeal.5  Discussion  [9] I have considered the authorities to which Ms McCartney has referred me but I do not consider that I have jurisdiction to make the further order that Mrs N seeks.6 Although High Court Rules, r 14.8(2) permits the Court to revisit costs that it has previously ordered on an interlocutory application, there is no equivalent provision in respect of costs ordered following judgment. None of the authorities to which I was referred is directly relevant to the situation that arises in the present case.  4 MemorandumofCounsel forthe Appellant dated27October2017at [8].  5 At [2]; and AC Beck and others McGechan on Procedure (looseleaf ed, Thomson Reuters) at [HRPt14.17(11)].  6 Haronga v Waitangi Tribunal [2011] NZCA 670, (2011) 20 PRNZ 855; LSG Sky Chefs New Zealand Ltd v Pacific Flight Catering Ltd [2015] NZHC 685; Wholesale Distributors Ltd v Songle Supermarket Ltd [2015] NZHC 809; Americhip, Inc v Dean [Costs] [2015] NZHC 1871, (2015) 22 PRNZ 703; and Murrell v Hamilton [2014]NZCA377, (2014) 3 NZTR 24-012.  Haronga v Waitangi Tribunal  [10] In Haronga v Waitangi Tribunal, the Court of Appeal dismissed MrHaronga’s appeal but made no order as to costs.7 The Supreme Court then allowed Mr Haronga’s appeal, awarded him costs in the Supreme Court and ordered the Court of Appeal and High Court to fix costs in those courts.8 I accept Ms McCartney’s submission that the Court of Appeal subsequently awarded costs to Mr Haronga as if it had allowed his appeal.  However, the important point for present purposes is that the Supreme Court had remitted the issue of costs back to the Court of Appeal which had, in any event,madeno earlier order as tocosts. These matters distinguish the case from the present.   LSG Sky Chefs New Zealand Ltd v Pacific Flight Catering Ltd  [11] Likewise, in LSG Sky Chefs New Zealand Ltd v Pacific Flight Catering Ltd. In the first instance the High Court awarded costs to LSG as the successful party.9  [12] The Court of Appeal allowed Pacific’s appeal against the High Court judgment on the merits, awarded costs on the appeal to Pacific, quashed the High Court order as to costs and directed the High Court to re-determine costs in accordance with the Court ofAppeal’s judgment, which the High Court did.10  Wholesale Distributors Ltd v Songle Supermarket Ltd  [13] The case closest to the present is Wholesale Distributors Ltd v Songle Supermarket Ltd, but in that case the High Court was reconsidering costs awarded on an interlocutory application, as to which the (then) High Court Rules, r 14.8(2) applied.11  7 Haronga Jnr v Waitangi Tribunal [2010]NZCA201. 8 Haronga v Waitangi Tribunal [2011] NZSC 53, [2012]2 NZLR 53 at [152]. 9 LSG Sky Chefs New Zealand Ltd v Pacific Flight Catering Ltd [2012] NZHC 2810 at [73]. 10 Pacific Flight Catering Ltd v LSG Sky Chefs New Zealand Ltd [2013] NZCA 386, [2014] 2  NZLR 1 at [42] and [43]; and LSG Sky Chefs New Zealand Ltd v Pacific Flight Catering Ltd, above n 6.  The Supreme Court’s subsequent dismissal of LSG’s appeal did not affect the matters referred to above. See LSG Sky Chefs New Zealand Ltd v Pacific Flight Catering Ltd [2014] NZSC 158, [2016]1 NZLR 433.  11 Wholesale Distributors Ltd v Songle Supermarket Ltd, above n 6.   [14] In that case, Moore J had declined WDL’s application for an interim injunction and awarded costs against WDL.12 Although the Court of Appeal allowed WDL’s appeal and awarded WDL costs on the appeal, it did not quash the High Court order as to costs nor remit the matter of costs on the application back to the High Court.13 Moore J had jurisdiction to revisit his earlier order and to make a fresh order in favour ofWDLunder r 14.8(2) which provides:  14.8 Costs on interlocutory applications  (1)  Costs on an opposed interlocutory application, unless there are special reasons to the contrary,—   (a)  must be fixed in accordance with these rules when the application is determined; and   (b)  become payable when they are fixed.     (2)  Despite subclause (1), the court may reverse, discharge, or vary an order for costs on an interlocutory application if satisfied subsequently that the original order should not have been made.   (3)  This rule does not apply to an application for summary judgment.    [15] As I have said, there is no equivalent provision to r 14.8(2) in respect of costs awarded after judgment.  Americhip, Inc v Dean  [16] Ms McCartneyalso referred me to Americhip, Inc v Dean. In that case Ellis J had dismissedAmerichip’s proceeding on the ground the Court had no jurisdiction to  14 hear and determine the claim. Ellis J awarded costs to Mr Dean.  [17] The Court of Appeal allowed Americhip’s appeal, ordered Mr Dean to pay costs in the Court of Appeal and quashed Ellis J’s order as to costs.15 Other than that, however, the Court of Appeal made no order regarding costs in the High Court, although it did remit the case back to the High Court to determine a separate issue.  12 Wholesale Distributors Ltd v Songle Supermarket Ltd [2014] NZHC 2548 at [85]. 13 Wholesale Distributors Ltd v Songle Supermarket Ltd [2014] NZCA565, (2014) 16 NZCPR 14  at [38].  14 Americhip Inc v Dean [2014]NZHC 450 at [73].  15 Americhip Inc v Dean [2014]NZCA380, [2014] NZAR 1137 at [26].  [18] Americhip subsequently sought costs in the High Court on the application that had come before Ellis J. Katz J considered that costs in the High Court remained at large, given that the Court of Appeal had quashed Ellis J’s order as to costs and she awarded coststo Americhip. Iaccept Ms McCartney’s submission that Katz J determined those costs in the absence of a direction from the Court of Appeal that the High Court should do so. Again, however, the original order as to costs in the High Court had been quashed and Katz J was considering costs on an interlocutory matter.  Conclusion  [19] In the circumstances that arise I am not satisfied that I have jurisdiction to makethe order Mrs Nseeks. Iconsiderthat the earlier orderthat Imadestands until itis quashed bythe Court of Appeal. Had Ibeen persuaded otherwise,Iwould have awarded costs to Mrs N on the basis that she should have succeeded before me, although I may have raised an issue as to the quantum sought.   [20] I dismiss Mrs N’s application for costs accordingly.  Peters J   
IN THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS AUTHORITY CHRISTCHURCH  [2017] NZERA Christchurch 216 5639390  BETWEEN  FRANKLYN WATE Applicant   AND  TALBOT AGRICULTURE LIMITED Respondent   Member of Authority:  Andrew Dallas   Representatives:  John Horan, Advocate for the Applicant Craig O’Connor, Counsel for the Respondent   Determination:  14 December 2017     COSTS DETERMINATION OF THE AUTHORITY  Narrative  [1] By determination issued on 26 October 2017, the Authority made findings  about Franklyn Wate’s employment relationship problem with Talbot Agriculture  Limited (Talbot).  [2] The determination reserved costs but encouraged the parties to resolve that issue themselves. It included an indication that, if asked to determine costs, the  Authority’s assessment would be the notional daily tariff of $4500.  [3] In a memorandum on costs subsequently lodged by Mr Wate, through his representative, he sought an order for a costs award of $22,526.40. No evidence, such as invoices, was provided in support of this claim. Upon review it was apparent the costs sought were, in effect, indemnity costs and included various disbursements, such as travel expenses, and costs associated with mediation.  [7] The starting point of any costs assessment is the notional daily tariff of $4500. Mr Wate has provided no evidence in support of his claim for an uplift in this amount.  I accept Talbot’s submission that it is very difficult to properly assess Mr Wate’s  claim for disbursements in the absence of such evidence.

     IN THE DISTRICT COURT  AT MORRINSVILLE    CRI-2017-092-009784    [2017] NZDC 28978        MINISTRY OF PRIMARY INDUSTRIES     Prosecutor    v        BUNNA SDEONG  Defendant            Hearing:     13 December 2017       Appearances:     J Priest for the Prosecutor  M Wright for the Defendant      Judgment:     13 December 2017          NOTES OF JUDGE N D COCURULLO ON SENTENCING     [1] Mr Sdoeng you appear having now pleaded guilty to a charge contrary to the Biosecurity Act 1993 and s 72 Crimes Act 1961 that you attempted to have unauthorised goods namely fish and animal skin in your possession or control concealed in parcels of squid knowing that they were unauthorised goods.  The offence attracts a maximum prison sentence of five years and/or a $100,000 fine.     [2] You are 28 years old and employed as a factory worker for a local milk company.  In November 2016 you arrived in New Zealand from Cambodia.  You completed a declaration and declared some matters but no entry was made regarding the declaration of fish or animal skins.  The customs officials at the airport found [the] concealment of fish wrapped in plastic wrap inside the parcel of the squid that had been declared.  It found fish products also including fish guts and one contained the    concealment of two animal skins.  You were spoken to and said that you had concealed the fish and animal skins because you knew that they were not allowed into New Zealand.   [3] These products are banned from New Zealand and they are banned for good reason.  It is to effectively manage pests and unwanted organisms and if they come into New Zealand there is a grave risk that our massive primary industry could be jeopardised by such pests and organisms coming into the country.  That is why the offence that you face has a maximum prison sentence of five years and/or a fine of $100,000.   [4] Mr Wright is has seen you as the duty solicitor.  I am most assisted by Ms Priest who has not only spoken to me orally - these matters not usually being dealt with by a Court in this location - but has provided comprehensive and written submissions.  She is to be complimented on the quality of the submissions that have been made.  She is clear that a starting point for you in respect of this matter is a fine of somewhere between five to $6,000 and/or a community work order.  Community work is a problem for you given the hours that you work at the factory.  I am told that you have a family that you are supporting.  I am told that you have $1,000 of savings that you can make available to pay a fine.     [5] All Courts have guidance from appellant Courts about having assessed an amount of a fine and here the prosecution is on strong ground - then having to consider an amendment of it to take into account that a fine would be paid over a reasonable period of time.  A fine at that level at $50 per week if that could be occasioned would take a significant amount of time.  I take into account your guilty plea to the matter and I intend to reflect a reduction in the fine to some extent to take into account your personal circumstances and ability to pay.  Given all of that, I now Mr Sdeong having convicted you fine you the sum of $3,000 and that is to be paid at the initial instalment of $1,000 and then at the rate of $50 per week.    ________________  Judge ND Cocurullo  District Court Judge    Date of authentication: 19/12/2017  In an electronic form, authenticated pursuant to Rule 2.2(2)(b) Criminal Procedure Rules 2012.

B The conviction for being an accessory after the fact to murder is quashed. There is no order for a retrial.    REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Brown J)  [1] Mr McIntyre pleaded guilty to a charge of accessory after the fact to murder. The alleged primary offender defended the murder charge, claiming self-defence,  MCINTYRE v R [2017] NZCA579[11 December 2017]  and was acquitted.  Following that acquittal, Mr McIntyre appeals his conviction.1  [2] To succeed on achargeof accessoryafter the fact to anothercrimethe Crown must prove the substantive crime was committed, although it is not necessary that a person be convicted of that substantive crime. In the circumstances, the Crown conceded that the successful self-defence claim by the alleged primary offender has the consequence that there was no murder. Accordingly, Mr McIntyre cannot be an accessory to a murder that did not occur.  [3] We accept the Crown’s submission that this case falls within the second category of exceptional circumstances in R v Le Page2 and Watts v R3 so as to permit a successful conviction appeal following a plea of guilty. That is where a miscarriage of justice arises because, on the admitted facts, the appellant could not in law have been convicted of the offence charged. Consequently, notwithstanding the guilty plea, we allow Mr McIntyre’s appeal against his conviction on the charge of accessory after the fact to murder.   Result  [4] The appeal is allowed.  [5] The conviction for beingan accessory after thefact to murder is quashed.  [6] There is no order for a retrial.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  CLARK ROAD DEVELOPMENTS LTD v GRANDE MEADOWDEVELOPMENTS LTD [2017] NZHC 3062 [11 December 2017]  [1] On 24 October 2017 I dismissed an application for an interim mandatory injunction by Clark Road Developments Ltd (Clark Road).1 It is common ground the first to third defendants (the defendants) are entitled to 2B costs. They, however, seek increased costs on the basis the application plainly lacked merit.2 Clark Road contends otherwise.  [2] I accept the defendants’ contention because:  (a)  Theapplication sought final relief in theguise of interim relief.   (b)  There was no basis to invoke this Court’s jurisdiction for interim relief, which, by virtue of an arbitration clause, was confined to “urgent interlocutory relief”.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TE WHANGANUI-A-TARA ROHE CIV-2017-485-001007 [2017] NZHC 3060  UNDER THE Habeas Corpus Act 2001 IN THE MATTER OF Application for writ of Habeas Corpus BETWEEN RICARDO ROMANOV  Applicant AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE,  DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS First Respondent THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL  Second Respondent Hearing: 11 December 2017 Counsel: Applicant in person ( via AVL)  V McCall for First and Second Respondents Judgment: 11 December 2017  JUDGMENT OF COLLINS J  Introduction  [1] Mr Romanov is a prisoner in Rimutaka Prison. He applies for a writ of habeas corpus. He says he is "entitled to be heard before the Parole Board immediately, and to be released on parole".  [2] Mr Romanov has an extensive history of imprisonment dating back to September 1998 when he was sentenced to a total of 16 years and nine months' imprisonment for aggravated robbery and other charges. He escaped from prison on  ROMANOV v THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE, DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS [2017] NZHC 3060 [11 December 2017]  1 February 2006 and upon being recaptured was sentenced to another two years' imprisonment. He was released from prison on 7 March 2012 in relation to these matters but remained, according to the Department, eligible for recall up until 10 March 2015, which was his statutory release date. On 29 May 2013, Mr Romanov was arrested and remanded in custody for a burglary offence. He was sentenced on 4 May 2017 to seven years' imprisonment for that offending. The Department of Corrections has calculated that Mr Romanov's parole eligibility date in relation to that sentence is 10 September 2018.  [3] Mr Romanov says there are issues with the way his pre-sentence detention has been calculated. If that is so, then the correct procedure for him to follow is the appeal mechanism ins 92(4) of the Sentencing Act 2002. As matters currently stand, Mr Romanov is serving a sentence of imprisonment imposed upon him following a conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction. As his current parole eligibility date is currently calculated to be 10 September 2018, his application for a writ of habeas corpus must be dismissed.   fJ6il= 2:>  DB Collins J  Solicitors: Crown Law Office, Wellington for First and Second Respondents   
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA657/2016 [2017] NZCA 571  BETWEEN  DAVID LOGAN TUIRIRANGI Applicant   AND  NEW ZEALAND POLICE Respondent   Court:  Cooper and Winkelmann JJ   Judgment:  7 December 2017 at 11 am    (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to bring a second appeal is dismissed.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given byWinkelmann J)  [1] In 2016 Mr Tuirirangi applied for leave to bring a second appeal. He has,  however, failed to take steps necessary to progress that application. The history of  the proceeding is set out in a minute of Winkelmann J dated 18 October 2017 as  follows:1  [2] On 4 December 2015, following guilty pleas to charges of injuring with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and possession of an offensive weapon, MrTuirirangi was sentenced by Judge Smith in the District Court at Taihape to two years and six months imprisonment. On 23 November 2016 in the High Court Williams J dismissed Mr Tuirirangi’s first appeal against conviction but allowed his first appeal against sentence. Mr Tuirirangi’s sentence was quashed and replaced with a sentence of two years and two months imprisonment.  Tuirirangi v R CA657/2016,18 October2017 (Minute ofWinkelmannJ).  TUIRIRANGI v NEWZEALAND POLICE [2017] NZCA571 [7 December 2017]  [3] On 19 December 2016 Mr Tuirirangi applied for leave to bring a second appeal against conviction and sentence. Wild J directed that the application for leave be heard on the papers and that submissions were to be filed by17 February2017byMrTuirirangi. MrTuirirangidid not meetthat timetable. His application for legal aid was declined on 20 March 2017. He took no stepsto file submissions in compliance with an extended timetable.  [4] On 6 September 2017 Ms Nicolette Levy was appointed as counsel to assist with identifying whether there were any grounds to advance his application, to prepare submissions in respect of that application as he required and to provide such other assistance as he requires.  [5] Ms Levy has filed a memorandum in which she reports she met with MrTuirirangi on 8 September 2017 and discussed a wide range of matters relating to MrTuirirangi’s conviction, sentence, mental health and parole. Some of the observations he made during that meeting were inconsistent with wishing to continue his application for a second appeal and overall his ability to understand the complex issues was limited. He was nevertheless willing to speak with her.  [6] Following the meeting she sent a letter providing further advice and a noticeof abandonment of appeal if MrTuirirangi’s decision was that he did not wish to continue with the appeal. When she next visited Mr Tuirirangi he did not wish to speak with her, but using a prison guard as an intermediary she established that he had received her letter, thrown it out, that he could not remember having a live appeal, that he was not interested in it anyway because he did not have a lawyer and his sentence was nearly up.  [2] In that minute Mr Tuirirangi was advised that unless he filed submissions in  support of his application for leave to bring a second appeal by 24 November 2017,  his application for leave to appeal would be struck out for non-compliance with  timetabling orders.   [3] Mr Tuirirangi has not filed any submissions and is in continuing breach of  timetable orders.  [4] Pursuant to s 338 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, this Court has power  to dismiss an application for leave to appeal for non-compliance with timetable  orders. That is the appropriate step to be taken here. Given Mr Tuirirangi’s failure to  comply with the timetable orders to date, it seems clear he does not wish to proceed  with his application. The application for leave to bring a second appeal is therefore  dismissed.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent

B The application is otherwise dismissed.  C  There is no costs award.  HINEMANU NGARONOA, SANDRAWILDE,ANDARTHUR WILLIAMTAYLOR v ATTORNEY-GENERAL[2017] NZSC 183[6 December 2017]  REASONS  [1] The applicants seek leave also on the issue of whether the 2010 amendment discriminates on the prohibited groundof racebecause Maori are over-represented in the NewZealand prison population. TheCourt of Appeal concludedthat therewasno discrimination, either direct or indirect.1  Our assessment  [2] The issues of discrimination and Maori over-representation in prison potentially raise matters of general or public importance. We do not, however, consider this is the right caseto considertheseissues and, in particular, the intersection between them.2 We would be considering the issues in a very particular context. Further, a legislative provision is involved and all that is sought is a declaration.3  Result  [3] The application for leave to appeal is granted on the question of whether the Electoral (Disqualification of Sentenced Prisoners) Amendment Act 2010 purported to amend an entrenched provision of the Electoral Act 1993 and thus required a 75per cent majority to be passed.  [4] The application is otherwise dismissed.  [5] There is no costs award.

REASONS  [1] Following his trial beforeajudge and jury, in theDistrict Court, the applicant was found guilty of failing to comply with an abatement notice issued under the Resource Management Act 1991. The abatement notice had been issued in respect of the relocation of a garage from the rear to the front of a residential section owned by the applicant. As relocated the garage was in breach of the District Plan. The applicant had previously unsuccessfully sought a resource consent for major works including the relocation of the garage. His appeal against conviction was dismissed by the Court ofAppeal.1  [2] Although the applicant has filed voluminous submissions and other material, the basis of the proposed appeal is far from clear. His primary complaint appears to be that the rules in the District Plan were not engaged by the relocation of the garage.  Fan v R [2017] NZCA41 (Wild, SimonFrance and DuffyJJ).  DAJIANG FAN v R [2017] NZSC 184[6December 2017]  The arguments which the applicant wishes to advance in respect of this complaint wereaddressed by the Court ofAppeal and rejected.2  [3] We see nothing in the arguments advanced by the applicant to suggest that thereis anypointof public importanceinvolved in the proposed appeal. Noris there any appearance of a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  [4] We note that the garage has recently been demolished and the applicant has lodged material with this Court in which he complains about the demolition. This Court does not have jurisdiction in these proceedings to address thesecomplaints.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent  At [4]–[8].

[1] This is an application for a one-month extension of time to file an application forahearingdate and file the case on appeal. TWAhas explained the delay and the need foran extension in two ways.   [2] First, the Registrar’s decision dispensing with security for costs was released on 15 September 2017. That coincided with two deadlines in other litigation TWA was involved in: one a criminal prosecution, the other an appeal to the Supreme Court. Secondly, beingin custody(imprisoned) means hehas been unableto consult with respondent counsel about the case on appeal, and there have been difficulties locating the relevant document file from its storage at Paremoremo prison.

You used your own [family members] identity to obtain a benefit in the form of National Super and you have gained some $20,943 that you were never entitled to and it was discovered when your [family member] returned to New Zealand.  You had secured a false passport in your [family member]’s name and travelled on it and you had used the same passport to obtain a licence in a false name.    [2] I have a letter from Presbyterian Support acknowledging the assistance they have given you but asking me to take into account that they simply cannot continue to subsidise your life on a daily basis.     [3] You are 74 years of age.  You have no previous convictions.  There is no entitlement to funding from the New Zealand Government in any form.  You have recently had a serious stroke.  You have other serious health problems and in particular that includes heart problems, and I see that you are taking medication for what I assume is for angina.  You are of no fixed abode, save that which is provided for you.  It could be said that you are at low risk of re-offending but as Mr Taylor has said in his report that ignores the long period of living under what is a stolen identity.  You have been served with a deportation order.  You will be deported upon completion of any sentence.   [4] I accept it is very serious offending to steal and use another person’s identity and to do so for a considerable period of time is a significant aggravating factor.  You did not stop until you were confronted with the truth and understood that others knew.  Conditions of release are not sought and a short sentence of imprisonment seems to be the only option.  I accept that imprisonment is required to mark the seriousness of the offending and as deterrence to reflect the ease with which you seem to have been able to take advantage of your wrongdoing over a long period of time but because of the extraordinary circumstances set out in Miss Burnside’s submissions, I accept a realistic approach is called for.  I adopt a starting point of six months.  I allow a reduction for plea and good character at one-third, giving me an end result of four months’ imprisonment.  That is not to be seen as indicative of the tariff or anything else.  I have no real advantage from submissions as to starting point.  It is merely a merciful response to reflect the extraordinary circumstances which are now before me.    [5] On each, you are convicted.  You are sentenced to imprisonment for four months.  Leave to apply for substitution of sentence is declined. The conditions of release imposed by statute and on statutory release date, reparation is declined as there is no realistic prospect of payment.  Fines of $1,040 are remitted forthwith.

TAYLOR v MINISTER OF INTERNALAFFAIRS [2017] NZHC2967 [1 December 2017]  [1] In my judgment of 22 September 2017 I dismissed Dr Taylor’s application under s 19(2)of the Citizenship Act 1977 and his application forjudicial review. As I have not been addressed on the issue of costs I invited counsel to file memoranda.  Counsel subsequently filed a joint memorandum indicating that they had conferred and agreed on the calculation of costs and disbursements.  [2] The calculation to which the parties have agreed provides for costs on a 2B basis with the disbursements as one would expect. I am satisfied that these costs are appropriate. I accordingly make the order sought, for costs in favour of the respondent of $23,749.50 and disbursements of $253.33.  P Courtney J  
IN THE HIGH COURT OFNEWZEALAND HAMILTON REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA  KIRIKIRIROAROHE CIV-2017-419-168 [2017] NZHC 2956  IN THE MATTER of an appeal against the decision of the District Court at Hamilton  BETWEEN THE CARPET BARN -HAMILTON ­LIMITED Appellant  AND BIANCA HELGA MARIA JOBE Respondent  Hearing: (On the papers)  Counsel: M D Branch and K F Shaw for Appellant T M Braun for Respondent  Judgment: 30 November 2017  COSTS JUDGMENT OFBREWER J  Solicitors: Harkness Henry (Hamilton) for Appellant Whitfield Braun (Hamilton) for Respondent  THE CARPET BARN HAMILTON LTD v JOBE [2017] NZHC 2956 [30 November 2017]  [1] In my judgment of 25 October 2017, I said:1  It is usual for costs to follow the event. In this case, I am minded to reserve costs. I will receive submissions to the contrary until 15 November 2017. If none are received, costs will be reserved without further order.  [2] I have received a memorandum of counsel for the appellant as to costs; no memorandum has been filed on behalf of the respondent.  [3] The appellant seeks costs on a 2B basis in reliance on the common practice that costs on interlocutory applications follow the event.  [4] On reflection, I find that the appellant is entitled to costs. The appellant was substantially successful in its appeal.  [5] I would normally award costs in a matter such as this on a 2B basis. However, Mr Branch advises in his memorandum (as is entirely proper) that the appeal was undertaken on a reduced fixed fee basis. Therefore, instead of 2B costs of $12,136, the total of costs and disbursements sought is $6,490.  [6] I award costs on the appeal to the appellant in the sum of $6,490.

Aklander Investment Ltd [2017] NZHC 2939[29November 2017]  [1] Aklander Investment Ltd (Aklander) wants to develop land in Flat Bush. It has obtained a resource consent from Auckland Council providing for the development of 164 residential lots, associated roads and infrastructure, and 16affordablehousing developments. But there isan obstacle. Acovenant prevents Aklander from erecting any building with an enclosed floor area of less than 150m2. Aklander applies to modify the covenant to enable the development to proceed. The application is brought under s 317 of the PropertyLaw Act 2007.  [2] The application was initially opposed with a notice of opposition by eight affected owners. However, seven of the eight now consent to the application. The eighth owners, Mr and Mrs Singh, have taken no step beyond the notice of opposition. And, this morning I granted leave for their counsel, who also acted for the seven other affected parties, to withdraw; Mr Jiang had no instructions.  [3] I am satisfied the application should be granted. The covenant was first registered in 1996. Auckland has changed—and grown significantly—since then. So too the area the subject of the application, with which I am familiar. I am satisfied the covenant ought to be modified because of a change since the covenant’s creation to the character of the neighbourhood: what was once largely rural land is now very much a residential part ofAuckland City.   [4] An application of this nature may require reasonable compensation to be paid. The evidence filed in support of the application satisfies me there will be no significant deleterious effects if the covenant is modified as proposed.  Consequently, I order land covenant D083110.1 is modified so it no longer applies to an estate in fee simple, Lot 1, deposited plan 178443 as comprised in unique identifier NA105B/641.  ……………………………..

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  [20 SC 105/2017 17] NZSC 177   BETWEEN  GARY OWEN BURApplicant  GESS   AND  MALLEY& CO Respondent    Court: Elias CJ, Glazebrook and O'Regan JJ Counsel: Applicant in person  A J Gaborieau for Respondent Judgment: 27 November 2017  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent.    REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a judgment of the Court of Appeal.1 In that judgment, the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against a decision of Gendall J in the High Court, in which he ordered the applicant to pay the respondent outstanding fees and disbursements for legal services, together with interest.2 Gendall J also dismissed the applicant’s counterclaim alleging negligence and other failings by the respondent. The Court of Appeal awarded increased costs against Mr Burgess because he had “contributed unnecessarily and  1 Burgess v Malley & Co [2017] NZCA 401 (French, Simon France and Toogood JJ) [Burgess (CA)].  2 Malley & Co v Burgess [2016]NZHC 907.  GARYOWEN BURGESS v MALLEY&CO [2017] NZSC 177 [27 November 2017]  unreasonably to the cost of the appeal by raising a multiplicity of arguments that were without merit”.3  [2] This is the third application for leave to appeal made by the applicant in relation to his dispute with the respondent.4  [3] The applicant wishes to contest on appeal a number of factual findings made in the Courts below, which he argues are contrary to the evidence, or are based on a rejection of his evidence that ought to have been accepted. He also wishes to argue that the finding that the lawyer who acted for him in relationship property proceedings, Mr Tait of Malley & Co, had not done or omitted to do anything that substantiated an action against him or the firm for negligence or otherwise was based on errors of both fact and law. In addition, he seeks to raise matters relating to the calculation of the amount he owed the respondent.  [4] The applicant’s defence to the claim for fees and his counterclaim against the respondent has been the subject of detailed consideration in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. All of the points the applicant wishes to raise are essentially relitigation of matters decided in the Courts below and are specific to the facts of the case. No point of general or public importance arises. The material before the Court does not give any reason to consider that a miscarriage of justice might arise if leave is not given.  In those circumstances we dismiss the application for leave to appeal.  [5] The applicant must pay costs to the respondent of $2,500.

He has done so on the basis of advice that is plainly wrong. Mr Boult is currently in custody as a remand prisoner, having been charged with assaulting a prison officer. That charge was brought under s 10 of the Summary Offences Act 1981.  [2] The charge against Mr Boult is to be called in the Whanganui District Court on 28 November 2017. Mr Boult is entitled to apply for bail when his case is called in the District Court on 28 November 2017.  [3] The information before me demonstrates that Mr Boult is lawfully detained in prison by an order remanding him in custody under s 168(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011. Therefore, the application under the Habeas Corpus Act has to be dismissed.   DB Collins J  Solicitors: Crown Law Office, Wellington for Respondent  
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA322/2017 [2017] NZCA 540  BETWEEN  HEATHER FUIMAONOAND MAHIA FUIMAONO Applicants   AND  LEEANNE HOUIA Respondent   Hearing:  20 November 2017   Court:  Miller, Cooper and Asher JJ   Counsel:  F Handy forApplicants A Knowsley for Respondent   Judgment:  22 November 2017 at 2.00 pm     JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is declined.  B No order for costs.    REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Miller J)  [1] The applicants seek leave to appeal under s 214 of the Employment Relations Act 2000 from an Employment Court decision holding that they, rather than their company, were the respondent’s employers and so personally liable to pay compensation for her unjustified dismissal.1  Fuimaono v Houia [2017] NZEmpC 63. Reference should be made to the decision for an account ofthe facts.  FUIMAONO &ANOR vHOUIA[2017] NZCA540 [22 November 2017]  [2] The necessary point of law identified is that the Court misinterpreted the intention to create legal relations which is fundamental to the law of contract.  Theapplicants concede that the Court cited the relevant principles of law, but it is said that had they been applied correctlya different answer must have resulted.  [3] In our view, the case turns on its facts, or to put it another way it raises no serious question of law. In essence, the applicants complain that the Employment Court discounted evidence tending to show that the company was the employer. The Court correctly directed itself that it must consider the real nature of the relationship and it focused on the objective indicia.2 The findings that it made were plainly available to it.  [4] In any event, the applicants face two further difficulties which appear to render the proposed appeal moot.  The first is if they contracted as agents they did so without disclosing the principal. It is no answer to this that they did disclose what the Court found was their own trading name. The second is that s 25(2) of the Companies Act 1993 applies, meaning they are personally liable unless that would not be just and equitable. The applicants were personally responsible for the respondent’s dismissal. All that might be said in their favour is that they did not intend to deceive by failing to disclose the company’s name.  [5] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed. As the applicants are legally aided, we make no order as to costs.  Solicitors: RaineyCollins,Wellington for Respondent  At [41]–[46].

B Costs of $2,500 are awarded to the respondents.  REASONS Background  [1] Mr Herron applies for leave to appeal against a decision of the Court of Appeal.1  Wallace v Herron [2017] NZCA346 (K.s P, HarrisonandWinkelmann JJ).  STUARTWALTON HERRON vWAYNE ANDREWWALLACE [2017] NZSC 174[22 November 2017]  [2] The background is complicated and fully explored in the Court of Appeal judgment.2 For these purposes, it is only necessary to record that in contention is a clausein asettlement document that gave a creditof $675,000 if acontract relatingto a Queenstown apartment to be developed by interests associated with Mr Bryers became unconditional.  [3] The Court of Appeal held that Mr Herron had released the Bryers’ interests from their obligations with regard to that contract and had caused the condition not to be fulfilled.  He therefore could not recover the $675,000.3   Decision  [4] The judgment of the Court of Appeal related to the very particular facts and documentation in this case. This means that no point of general publicor commercial significance arises. Further, nothing raised by Mr Herron suggests a miscarriage of justice.4  [5] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  Costs of $2,500 areawarded to the respondents.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY   CIV-2017-485-897   [2017] NZHC 2832   BETWEEN  TE TANGATA WHENUA (AS THIRD   PARTY AND PERSONAL   REPRESENTATIVE OF RHYS   WARREN)   Applicant   AND  THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE   DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS   Respondent   On the papers:  17 November 2017   Counsel:  R Warren in person    V McCall for Respondent Judgment: 17 November 2017  JUDGMENT OF WILLIAMS J  [1] This matter came before me on 30 October 2017. It is an application for habeas corpus by a person who calls himself Te Tangata Whenua as a personal and third party representative of Rhys Warren. They appear to be the same person. It was Mr Warren who indicated initially that he would appear in person.  [2] I was to hear the matter by teleconference but Mr Warren would not come to the phone. I was advised he was being disruptive and was relocked in his cell. dispensed with the teleconference and asked Crown counsel to file a brief affidavit explaining what had happened.  [3] On 31 October, Senior Corrections Officer McBrearty filed an affidavit advising that at the time he was asked to take the call:  Mr Warren became very disruptive and ran around the unit, delivering CDs  and other items to other prisoners. He was directed to get on the call with  the Court.  WARREN v THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS [2017] NZHC 2832 [17 November 2017]  Then, he ran to the upper landing of the unit, and continued to deliver items to other prisoners. He was abusive towards staff. He was given a final direction to get on the call with the Court, but continued to be abusive and disruptive.  Rather than implement a control and restraint procedure either to force Mr Warren to take the Court's call or to stop conducting himself in an abusive and difficult way, the decision was instead made to re-lock him in his cell (for his own safety and that of staff).  [4] In my minute of 30 October, I gave Mr Warren until the end of the following day to file written submissions. He did not meet that deadline but on 16 November, he filed written submissions essentially challenging the legitimacy of the current legal order and therefore his incarceration; and suggesting he is not the person in whose name he is incarcerated.  [5] I am satisfied that this application for a writ of habeas corpus must be dismissed. The warrant pursuant to which Mr Warren is detained is valid. He is serving a sentence of preventive detention, a sentence handed down by Brewer Jon 11 August 2017.  [6] Crown counsel refers to authorities both with respect to Mr Warren's claimed dual personality, and with respect to the challenge to jurisdiction. Without needing to refer to any of them, I find that neither argument has any prospect of success.  [7] The application is dismissed accordingly.

Further, I consider that error to be one that is fatal to the decision to order reparation. Accordingly, the reparation order is set aside and the matter is remitted back to the District Court for further consideration in circumstances where the Court should before imposing any further reparation order obtain a report on Mr Martinson’s financial circumstances. Enquires should also be made as to the value of the trailer and vehicle immediately before the accident and the cost of repairing them to that value.   [2] Full reasons for my decision will follow in due course.  Duffy J  
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA412/2017 [2017] NZCA 512  BETWEEN  HEATHER WALMSLEY, DAVID CULLEN WALMSLEYAND WALMSLEY ENTERPRISES LIMITED Applicants   AND  PETER AITCHISONAND SYLVIA AITCHISON Respondents   Court:  French, Winkelmann and Brown JJ   Counsel:  D C Walmsley in person forApplicants AFD Cameron and M J Slyfield for Respondents   Judgment:  13 November 2017 at 3.30 pm    (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall is declined.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given byWinkelmann J)  [1] Mr Walmsley, one of the applicants in this proceeding, has filed two memoranda dated 7 November 2017 and 9 November 2017 respectively in connection with this Court’s judgment declining leave to bring a second appeal.1  [2] Mr Walmsley seeks to make further arguments in support of two grounds of appeal that had been proposed: that the issues in the proceeding were novel and that  Walmsley v Aitchison [2017]NZCA500.  WALMSLEYvAITCHISON [2017] NZCA512[13 November 2017]  the respondents’ proceeding was unfair because it involved re-litigation of an issue already decided in other proceedings. We treat the memoranda as an application for recall of this Court’s judgment.2  [3] However the material advanced by Mr Walmsley in his memoranda is an attempt to reargue points addressed in this Court’s judgment. He does not therefore make out a ground for recall in accordance with the test established in Horowhenua  3 County v Nash (No 2).  [4] The application for recall is declined.  Solicitors: Brookfields,Wellington for Respondents  2 Mr Walmsley also seeks “comment” on the judgment. As he anticipates, this Court will not comment on its judgment.  3 Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2) [1968]NZLR 632 (SC) at 633. 
     IN THE DISTRICT COURT  AT NORTH SHORE    CRI-2016-044-001730    [2017] NZDC 25619        MINISTRY OF HEALTH     Prosecutor    v        SHEARWATER HOTELS LIMITED  Defendant            Hearing:     10 November 2017       Appearances:     J Wilson for the Prosecutor   J Quinn for the Defendant       Judgment:     10 November 2017          NOTES OF JUDGE P J SINCLAIR ON SENTENCING [1] Shearwater Hotels Limited appears for sentence in relation to three charges of failing to take all reasonably practicable steps to ensure that no person smokes in a part of a licensed premises that is not an open area.  Those offences have a maximum penalty of a $4000 fine.     [2] This matter has a protracted history.  On 7 December last year, Shearwater Hotels Limited was found guilty after a Judge alone trial on four charges laid under the same sections; ss 12, 17, 17A Smoke-free Environments Act 1990.     [3] On 20 January, I sentenced Shearwater to combined fines of $2700 on all charges along with Court costs of $130.  I also imposed solicitor costs of $850.  The reasons for my guilty findings and sentencing are contained in written decisions dated 7 December and 20 January respectively.    [4] Shearwater appealed the convictions and on 13 March this year the High Court allowed the appeal in particular in relation to an interpretation of “internal area” under the Act, and quashed the convictions.  The charges were referred back to this Court to determine whether the Beachfront Lane and Anzac Road areas were, in fact, internal areas.  Since then, on 5 September, Shearwater has pleaded guilty and admitted three of the charges (one charge has been withdrawn).  So the matter is remanded to today for sentence.     [5] Mr Quinn, representing Shearwater Hotels, has advised that he cannot pursue the matter any further as he has “run out of funds”.  He urges the Court to impose a nominal fine in view of the history of this matter.  The Crown submit that I re-impose or re-instate the fines I imposed in January of this year, taking into account there is one less charge to address.     [6] In my view, there is no need for me to traverse the facts or matters I took into account for sentencing.  A copy of an amended summary of facts can be annexed to this decision.   [7] Mr Quinn has pleaded guilty to the charges on the basis of the lengthy summary of facts I have referred to.  In my view, Mr Quinn is entitled to a discount for the guilty pleas he has entered.  It has obviated the need for a further trial.  Although, as the Crown has submitted, this particular situation has not been contemplated by R v Hessell1 and therefore I cannot draw on the factors specifically referred to in that decision, in my view Shearwater Hotels is entitled to a discount of around 15 percent.      [8] On that basis, taking into account there is one less charge, I impose a fine of $1650 across the three charges plus Court costs of $130 and solicitor’s costs of $850.    1 R v Hessell [2009] NZCA 450, [2010] 2 NZLR 298            P J Sinclair  District Court Judge

REASONS  [1] The applicant has applied for a recall of this Court’s judgment in Rabson v Attorney-General (the leave judgment).1  [2] The application discloses no basis for recall.  In the leave judgment, the Court observed that the application for leave was an abuse of process.2 The present application continues that abuse of process.  1 Rabson v Attorney-General [2017] NZSC 149. 2 At [3].

  NOTE: PUBLICATION OF           IN THE DISTRICT COURT  AT GREYMOUTH    CRI-2017-018-000229    [2017] NZDC 24814             Prosecutor    v        [FERGUS MELLOR]  Defendant            Hearing:     31 October 2017       Appearances:     G Henderson for the Prosecutor  E Bradley for the Defendant       Judgment:     31 October 2017          NOTES OF JUDGE R J MURFITT ON SENTENCING     [1] Mr [Mellor] you pleaded guilty to a charge of posting a digital communication on 1 January 2017.  That was an explicit video of intimate behaviour between you and your then partner and it was posted to her 16 year old son.      [2] The probation officer’s report describes this as having been done with callous indifference to the effect that this video would have on the recipient and also on your former partner.     [3] On 11 July I indicated that a prison term of 12 months would in my view be a suitable outcome and on that basis you pleaded guilty.  Various efforts have been made to explore the options of a home detention sentence.  Your mother who cares for you a great deal has been very honest and very up-front in saying that 12 months is too long for her to manage the detention of you at her home.   [4] I intend to deal with the matter today because delaying it any further is not good for you.  It is affecting your mental health.  It is affecting the stability of the complainant as well.  Today I will impose the term of imprisonment of 12 months but I will grant you leave to apply for home detention there.  I impose also post-release conditions for a period of six months after your release date directing that you are to: (a) Complete an alcohol or drug assessment and any alcohol or any treatment recommended including residential treatment that might be seen as necessary.   (b) To complete any treatment with a departmental psychologist as directed by your probation officer and to the satisfaction of your probation officer.      [5] I also direct, with your consent and approval, a protection order to issue in favour of the complainant and also her son.            R J Murfitt  District Court Judge

I also made an order requiring ATM to answer certain of the interrogatories sought by the plaintiffs (Tourplan).  I invited counsel to address the issue of costs by memorandum.  [2] I thank counsel for their constructive approach on the costs issue. Tourplan seek costs on a 2B basis of $9,366 together with disbursements of $600, totalling $9,966. ATM accepts that costs may be ordered on this basis. Counsel for Tourplan and ATM have addressed some otheraspects which bore on the issue of costs. They do not require anydecision from me but I do record that I have considered the points made.  [3] There are to be costs as sought in accordance with the calculation attached to the memorandum of Tourplan’s counsel dated 20 September 2017.  P Courtney J  
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA503/2017 [2017] NZCA 485  BETWEEN JAKUB DVORAK Applicant   AND SHIORIYAMAMOTO Respondent  Court: Kós P, Harrison and Gilbert JJ  Counsel: PA Kirkfor Respondent  Judgment: 27 October 2017 at 2.30 pm (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for an extension of time is deemed abandoned. B The application for leave to appeal is deemed abandoned. C No order for costs.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Harrison J)  [1] On 23 August 2017 the late Jakub Dvorak1 applied to this Court to bring an appeal against a decision of Moore J in the High Court, dismissing Mr Dvorak’s appeal against a Family Court decision making orders for the day-to-day care of his  1 The names used in this judgment, as in the High Court, are fictitious to protect the identities of the parties and their children.  DVORAK V YAMAMOTO [2017] NZCA485[27 October 2017]  children.2 MrDvorak’s application forleaveto appeal was filed some 10 days out of time, which is why he also applied for an extension of time. However, Mr Dvorak did not pay a filing fee or file an application for a fee waiver.   [2] Mr Dvorak died on or about 26 September 2017. The nature of his application was personal to him. Section 47 of the Care of Children Act 2004 provides that certain people may take the place of a parent who has died for the purposes of determining who may have contact with the child. However, we are satisfied that this provision is applicable to a fresh application for a parenting order, not to an appeal, and in any event no party or legal representative has identified an interest in or asserted a right to continue the proceeding in this Court.  [3] This Court’s rules do not prescribe how to determine an application for leave to appeal, or to extend time, in the event of the applicant’s death. However, under r 5(4) of the Court ofAppeal (Civil) Rules 2005, if any matter arises in a proceeding for which no form of procedure is prescribed, this Court must dispose of the application in the manner which is best calculated to promote the ends of justice.  [4] Because we have not assessed the merits, we are not in a position to positively decline the applications. However, Mr Dvorak was not represented by counsel and we are satisfied in the circumstances that no other party will seek leave to pursue these applications and the proposed appeal on his behalf. In our judgment the ends of justice would be best promoted by deeming both of his applications abandoned. There will be no order for costs.

[2] The amendment or supplement is to authorise the Official Assignee to execute documents in the name of the registered proprietor(s) of the subject property, to meet the requirements of the Registrar-General of Land for registration of documents by other than the registered proprietor.  [3] No response has been forthcoming from therespondent.  [4] I agree the amendment or supplement is necessary to give effect to the Court’s profit forfeiture order.

[2] Mr Moala opposes the application insofar as it relates to DNA evidence found on a cap and singlet. There is no opposition to the scene measurement evidence to be adduced.  [3] I received submissions and heard argument on the application on the afternoon of 19 October 2017. Because the trial is due to commence on Tuesday, 24 October 2017 (following the long weekend), I am issuing a results judgment this morning, with reasons to follow.  [4] The Crown's application is granted. The DNA evidence relating to the singlet and the cap is admissible in Mr Moala's trial.  [5] However, Mr Moala's fair trial rights require him to be afforded an oppmtunity to consult with and possibly engage expetts to challenge and/or respond to that evidence. There is insufficient time before the commencement of the trial to allow that to happen and there is no other option but to adjourn the trial.   Result  [6] The Crown's application is granted and the evidence is ruled admissible.  [7] The trial due to commence on 24 October 2017 is adjourned. It is to be listed in the criminal call over list at 9.00 am on Wednesday, 15 November 2017 for the allocation of a new trial date.  Edwards J

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE MINISTRYOF SOCIALDEVELOPMENTv BROADBENT [2017] NZCA474 [19 October 2017]   REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given by Kós P)  [1] The approved question involves a matter of general or public importance, affecting means assessments for some 200 applicants annually for a residential care subsidyand the level of subsidyof an estimated almost 572 residential care residents at anyonetime.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA TE WHANGANUI-A-TARAROHE CIV 2017-485-557 [2017] NZHC 2553  BETWEEN w Applicant  AND ACCIDENT COMPENSATION CORPORATION Respondent  Hearing: 18 October 2017  Counsel: J Miller and L Newman for Applicant D Tuiqereqere for Respondent  Judgment: 19 October 2017   JUDGMENT OF SIMON FRANCE J  [1] This application concerns the proper interpretation of s 26(1 )(c) of the Accident Compensation Act 2001. At issue is the causal link required between physical injury and consequent mental injury. The applicant wishes to contend that the changes to the legislation following ACC v E have been over emphasised, resulting in too high a causal link being required. An incorporated issue is whether the removal of "accident" from the relevant legislation, thereby requiring the mental injury to be linked to the physical injury (rather than injury or accident) has disallowed coverage for mental injury flowing from the circumstances or consequences of an injury -eg the athlete who suffers depression because a broken leg has cost her a place at the Olympics.  W v ACC [2017] NZHC 2553 [19 October 2017]  [2] The Corporation's position is that the law is settled, and the cases are just factual applications turning on the medical evidence. That is arguably correct, but Ms Newman has satisfied me that there is a contrary view to be put that will be well researched and presented.  [3] My primary hesitation in granting leave is whether W's situation will fall within the test, however interpreted. On its face, it would represent the tenuous end of a causation spectrum. However, the applicant's approach would accommodate it, and accordingly I have determined a grant of special leave is appropriate.  [4] Leave will be given on the first two proposed questions. I do not consider the third question, which purports to identify a burden of proof issue in relation to whether the evidence shows W to have made a claim in or around 1979, is seriously arguable. Nor does it involve a question of law. Rather, it is a challenge to the Court's determination on the evidence.  [5] Leave to appeal is given on the following questions (which overlap):  1. What is the proper ambit and meaning of the words "because of' in s 26( 1 )( c) of the Accident Compensation Act 2001?  11. Was her Honour correct to hold that a "direct" causal link between the physical injury and mental injury was required to satisfy s 26(1)(c) of the Accident Compensation Act 2001 (mental injury suffered because ofphysical injury).  [6] Once the appeal is filed, the parties should organise a fixture ( one and a half days?) and then submit a consent memorandum concerning timetabling.   Simon France J  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY  I TE KOTI MATUA O AOTEAROA   TE WHANGANUI-A-TARA ROHE   CIV-2017-485-763   [2017] NZHC 2558   IN THE MATTER OF  Section 52 Trustee Act 1956   AND   IN THE MATTER OF  an application by G.A.L. TRUSTEES   LIMITED at Lower Hutt as Trustee ofthe   Daphne B Family Trust for a Vesting   Order    On the papers Judgment: 19 October 2017  JUDGMENT OF CULL J  [1] The applicant, G.A.L Trustees Ltd applies for an order granting permission to commence an application for a vesting order by way of originating application, in respect of the Daphne B Family Trust (the Trust). The grounds on which the order is sought is that the applicant's co-trustee of the Trust, Mrs Daphne Brennan (Mrs Brennan), has become incapable of acting as a trustee as a result of dementia.  [2] Pursuant to cl 17.l(b) of the Trust Deed, by Deed of Nomination of an Appointer dated 1 October 2012, Mrs Brennan's son, John Alan Brennan (John Brennan) was appointed to exercise his mother's powers as appointor in her place at any time that her powers were deemed to be suspended. As Mrs Brennan has become incapable of acting as a trustee, John Brennan gave notice to his mother and the applicant that his mother's powers as appointor were suspended and she was removed as a trustee ofthe Trust.  [3] The applicant acknowledges that John Brennan has validly given notice removing his mother, Mrs Brennan, as a trustee of the Trust and seeks an order vesting the Trust's property situated at 4 School Road, Plimmerton, Porirua in the applicant, to give effect to the removal of Mrs Brennan as a trustee.  [4] Importantly, the children of Mrs Brennan, namely John Brennan, Sally Anne Alvey and Jennifer Maree Brennan, who are the final beneficiaries of the Trust, have consented to this application.  [5] I therefore make the following order:  (a) G.A.L. Trustees Ltd as trustee of the Daphne B Family Trust is granted permission to commence this application for a vesting order by way of originating application.  Solicitors: ARLLawyers

BRKIC v WHITE [2017] NZHC 2542 [18 October 2017]  [1] On 29 September 2017 I acceded to the defendants’adjournment application in relation to a trial that was to commence on 2 October 2017 (the next business day). For the plaintiffs, Mr Rice seeks wasted costs of $8,028 on a 2B basis (three days’trial preparation and costs in connection with the adjournment teleconference). For the defendants, Mr Herzog resists on the basis costs should await the outcome of trial.  [2] I disagree. Wasted costs are frequently imposed on a party whose default resulted in an adjournment of a trial. There is no reason to depart from that principle, particularly when, as my adjournment decision makes plain, the defendants should have considered joining a third party long before the eve of trial.  Nor is the scale of wasted costs unreasonable having regard to the nature of the case, matters in issue and size of the common bundle.  [3] Thedefendants are liable for wasted costs in the sum of $8,028.  [4] Mr Rice also sought an “unless” order in connection with payment of wasted costs. This aspect was unsupported by a formal application or reference to authority.  I decline to make such an order for these reasons.  ……………………………..  Downs J  
.....     IN THE DISTRICT COURT  AT AUCKLAND    CRI-2017-004-000719    [2017] NZDC 23519        THE QUEEN         v        [ROBERT GRAHAM]          Date of Ruling:     17 October 2017       Appearances:     R Willox for the Crown  J Clearwater and J Nouri for the Defendant      Judgment:     17 October 2017          RULING 2 OF JUDGE E P PAUL   [1] This morning, 17 October, Mr Clearwater for the defendant has sought a mistrial.  He says that is based on the complainant giving evidence at page 40 notes of evidence concerning her head being smacked on the corner of a coffee table and there was blood all over the curtains, wall and on a single bed.  Also the evidence she gave of the defendant getting out of jail.   [2] Also the defendant’s attire at the commencement of the trial when he was dressed in prison clothing with the letters MECF stencilled on the back of his top.  And on that basis Mr Clearwater is submitting he will not receive a fair trial.  That application is premature and declined.   [3] In terms of the evidence of the coffee table, as indicated in my minute of yesterday, that can be dealt with squarely by a formal warning to the jury to put it to one side now and also when I sum up.    [4] As far as the reference to jail, that can be treated in the same manner.  The concerns about the defendant’s attire were addressed by me earlier on in the trial yesterday and I am simply not satisfied that that alone even in combination with the other matters, would be grounds to take the dramatic step of discharging the jury at this point and recommencing the trial.    [5] I am, however concerned that there is no further repetition by the complainant or any further witnesses in this trial of evidence being given that is clearly prejudicial to the defendant and has not been agreed to be led.  On that basis I will allow the Crown an opportunity to meet with the complainant to ensure there is no repetition when she resumes giving her evidence today.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 77/2017 [2017] NZSC 148   BETWEEN  ZHITONG LI Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Court:  William Young, Glazebrook and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  W C Pyke forApplicant Z R Johnston for Respondent   Judgment:  4 October 2017    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant was found guilty at trial of 14 charges of dealing in pseudoephedrine and two charges of possessing for sale and selling methamphetamine. His appeal to the Court of Appeal against conviction was confined to the methamphetamine charges.1 That appeal was dismissed and he now seeks leave to appeal against the Court ofAppeal judgment.2  [2] The methamphetamine charges were based substantially on an intercepted telephone discussion between the applicant and another person and contextual background evidence provided by a detective. While there was scope for argument as to what could be fairly inferred from what was said, it was well-open to inference that the conversation proceeded on the basis that: (a) the applicant was in possession of a controlled drug which he intended to sell; and (b) the drug was probably not  1 Li v R [2017] NZCA272 (Cooper,Woodhouse and Collins JJ) at [2]. 2 At [55].  ZHITONGLI v R [2017] NZSC148[4October 2017]  pseudoephedrine; but (c) had some connection with pseudoephedrine. As will be apparent, the jury drew the further inference that it was methamphetamine.  [3] There are two proposed grounds of appeal. The first is that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and the second that the primary direction by the trial Judge as to inferences was in respect of another defendant. The same arguments were advanced to the Court ofAppeal.3  [4] In dealing with whether the jury’s verdict was unreasonable, the Court of Appeal applied orthodox principles.4 Its application of those principles is challenged primarily in respect of the result. No point of general or public importance arises and we see no indication of a miscarriage of justice.  [5] The challenge as to the absence of an inference direction specific to the applicant was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on the basis that there was no need for the trial Judge to repeat the direction which he had already given in respect of the other defendant.5 Again no question of general or public importance is raised and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.  [6] The application for leave to appeal is accordinglydismissed.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 69/2017 [2017] NZSC 147   BETWEEN  STANLEYALLEN GILMOUR Applicant   AND  CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFTHE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS Respondent   Court:  William Young, O'Regan and Ellen France JJ   Counsel:  W G C Templeton and TA Chubb forApplicant D J Perkins and M J McKillop for Respondent   Judgment:  3 October 2017    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks a recall of our judgment of 4 September 2017 dismissing his application forleave to appeal from ajudgment of the Court of Appeal.1 In issue is a parole assessment report provided to the Parole Board under s 43 (1) of the Parole Act 2002 by the Department of Corrections. His complaint is that a contribution which he, as a probation officer, had prepared in respect of a particular offender was not included in the final parole assessment report. In our judgment we said the offender’s principal case manager who finalised the report in the sense of signing and submitting “was entitled to form a judgment as to what should be included”.2  1 Gilmour v Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2017] NZSC133. 2 At [6].  STANLEYALLEN GILMOUR v CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFTHE DEPARTMENTOF CORRECTIONS [2017] NZSC 147 [3 October 2017]  [2] The basis of the recall application is that there was no evidence of such “entitlement” nor of any right of “veto” vested in the principal case manager. The application was supported with a mass of evidential material as to how the parole assessment reports are prepared.   [3] The application for recall is misconceived and the material relied on in support of it beside the point. The Court of Appeal held that the contents of the report are for the Department to determine and in particular that it “was open to the Department to view the information [in question] … as not relevant to the Board’s task”.3 This is the same approach as we took, save that we personalised the process by treating the principal case manager as the Departmental decision-maker. This personalisation was immaterial to the outcome of the application for leave to appeal. This is because the question which the applicant wished to raise on appeal (namely that the Department was required to include his contribution) did not depend on the identity of the person who decided that it should not be included. To the extent that the applicant’s complaint is that the Department was not entitled to exclude his contribution, this is just a re-run of the argument already addressed in the leave judgment.  [4] Accordingly, the application for recall is dismissed.

I held, at [48], that the respondents were entitled to costs and disbursements on both appeals which I said should be calculated on a Category 2B basis.  I set a timetable for the exchange of memoranda.  [2] The respondents' memorandum seeking costs reveals that Mr Hutcheson made three attempts to contact Ms Cheng, who was granted leave to appear for the appellant at the hearing, in order to resolve costs. He received no response. Although the appellant's memorandum was due by 28 July 2017, the Registry granted the appellant further indulgences but has been unable to make contact and no costs memorandum has been received.  [3] I am satisfied that the costs of $22,077 plus disbursements have been calculated according to scale. I order the appellant to pay those sums to the respondents accordingly.  ................................................. Toogood J  Charming Group (NZ) Limited v Singh [2017] NZHC 1217.  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 78/2017 [2017] NZSC 144   BETWEEN  RICHARD FREDERICK EILENBERG Applicant   AND  LINDAALEJANDRAGARCIA LOURDES GUTIERREZ Respondent    Court: William Young, Glazebrook and O'Regan JJ Counsel: JA Farmer QC and J K Goodall forApplicant A P Holgate for Respondent Judgment: 26 September 2017  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal (Eilenberg v Lourdes Gutierrez [2017] NZCA 270) is granted in part.  B The approved questions are:  (a)  Does pt 8 of the Family Proceedings Act 1980 implicitly exclude the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court to enforce a judgment from Mexico?   (b)  Would enforcement of the Mexican judgment be contrary to public policy?    C  The application for leave to appeal is otherwise dismissed.  RICHARD FREDERICK EILENBERGv LINDAALEJANDRAGARCIALOURDES GUTIERREZ[2017] NZSC 144 [26 September 2017]  REASONS  [1] Leave is also sought to appeal against the lifting of name suppression. The High Court agreed to a request from the parties to adopt pseudonyms in the judgment.1 The Court of Appeal rejected Dr Eilenberg’s application for continued name suppression. This was on the basis that the parties’ daughter is now 16 and lives in Mexico. The Court held that nothing advanced by Dr Eilenberg displaced the presumption of open justice.2  [2] Nothing put forward in the leave application throws doubt on the Court of Appeal conclusion.  The application for leave to appeal on this point is declined.  [3] Leave was also sought on whether the Court of Appeal was correct to refuse to admit fresh evidence from Dr Eilenberg’s attorney in Mexico as to the issues Dr Eilenberg has faced in the Mexican courts in attempting to have the maintenance order re-assessed.  [4] We agree with the Court ofAppeal that the proposed evidence is not material to the issues this Court has to decide in the appeal.3 Leave to appeal is also declined on this point.

An application has been made pursuant to s 19 of the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (the Act) seeking an order requiring the defendant to take down the posting from that site.   [2] The defendant accepts she has an obligation to remove the content from that site and has already taken steps to try to have it removed, including employing The Investigators to assist her to have the content removed from the site.  To date that has been unsuccessful.    [3] At today’s hearing other potential avenues were identified pursuant to which the material could be taken down.  This Court therefore makes the following orders: (a) That the defendant is to take all possible steps now and in the future to take down or disable the online material referring to and showing a photo of Ms [Gibbons], including giving notice to [the USA based online hosting service and website names deleted].  The intent of this order is that it should have at least the same effect as a DMCA notice in USA law.   (b) The defendant is to cease or refrain from this type of conduct concerning Ms [Gibbons].   (c) It is accepted that the entities concerned that might have the ability to take down the material are based in the United States of America and are not subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.  Notwithstanding that lack of jurisdiction, the entities concerned are invited to be cognisant of the fact that a Court has seen fit to make this order and are thereby encouraged to comply with it.      [4] It is accepted by the parties that Google NZ should not be part of these proceedings and are released from them accordingly.              N R Dawson  District Court Judge

[2] I have reviewed the financial position of both parties. I am satisfied that in each case it would cause serious hardship to them to contribute to such costs and that in the case of the respondent such contribution would also cause material hardship to the child “I” who is in her care.  [3] I take into account also the fact that the appeal arose out of an order made by the Family Court which was in excess of statutory jurisdiction. To remedy that error the appellant had no alternative but to appeal.   [4] In the circumstances I consider it appropriate, taking into account the discretion reserved to me under s 135A(5), to relieve both appellant and respondent of their obligations to contribute to counsel for the child’s fee.  [5] I order accordingly.  Muir J  Counsel/Solicitors: S Sharma, Barrister, Henderson G M Cameron, Barrister,Auckland PLe’au’anae, Barrister, Manukau City 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 73/2017   [2017] NZSC 140   BETWEEN  JAWAHAR BHASKAR M USUKU   Applicant   AND  COMMISSIONER OF INLAND   REVENUE   Respondent   Court: Elias CJ, William Young and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  G J Thwaite forApplicant   M Deligiannis and M  J Bryant for Respondent   Judgment: 14 September 2017    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  An extension of time is granted but the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.   REASONS  [1] The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal against an order adjudicating him bankrupt on the application of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue.1 His application for an order dispensing with the provision of security for costs was refused by the Deputy Registrar and his application to review that refusal was dismissed by Brown J,2 as was an application for a recall of that judgment.3 He now seeks leave to appeal against the judgment dismissing his application for review and seeks an associated extension of time.  We grant an extension as sought.  [2] The applicant is facing over 70 charges under the Crimes Act 1961 which relate to alleged offending relating to PAYE and GST returns. He is apparently  1 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Musuku [2016] NZHC 2773 (Associate Judge Doogue). 2 Musuku v Commissioner of Inland Revenue [2017] NZCA144 [Musuku (CA)]. 3 Musuku v Commissioner of Inland Revenue [2017] NZCA255.  JAWAHAR BHASKAR MUSUKU v COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE [2017] NZSC 140[14 September 2017]  living in Australia and there is an outstanding warrant out for his arrest. He has provided no evidence indicative of an actual inability to provide securityfor costs (as opposed to what might be inferred from his bankruptcy). In the decision under challenge, Brown J evaluated the application in terms of the approach adopted in  4 Reekie v Attorney-General.  [3] If leave to appeal were granted, the applicant would contend that the Reekie principles require adaptation in the present case because: (a) it involves an appeal challenging a bankruptcy order; (b) the Commissioner is the prosecutor in the criminal proceedings and the practical effect of the bankruptcy will be to require the applicant to defend those charges on legal aid and thus without the practical ability to choose his counsel; and (c) there are outstanding issues between the applicant and the Commissioner in other proceedings. He also would argue that the willingness of counsel to appear for him on appeal warrants dispensation with securityfor costs.  [4] The Reekie principles are sufficiently broad to encompass the present circumstances. Theywereappropriatelyapplied byBrown J. Thecasethus does not involve an issue of public or general importance and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.  [5] The application is accordingly dismissed. In light of the bankruptcy of the applicant, we make no order for costs.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Date……………  Solicitors:  Kemps Weir, Auckland   Pidgeon Law, Auckland   Copy to:  I J Williams/A J Steel, Auckland    WONG v UNITED CHINESE ASSOCIATIONS OF NEW ZEALAND INCORPORATED [2017] NZHC 2207 [12 September 2017]  [1] In judgment (No. 3) of Fogarty J of 11 July 2017 the Judge dealt with the issue of costs in the following way:  [35] UCANZ and Mr Guo are entitled to costs on a 2B basis for the costs incurred relating to the second judgment and this judgment.  [36] Mr Wong is entitled to costs from UCANZ on a 2B basis in the proceedings up to and including the first judgment of 27 February 2017, but excluding the application for the declaration and the resulting second judgment.  [2] Counsel for the plaintiff and first defendant have agreed the consequent calculation of costs and seek orders. The third defendant has failed to engage or respond to the request for a memorandum.   [3] Fogarty J has retired. Rule 14.9 applies. That enables another Judge to fix costs.  Orders  [4] The plaintiff is entitled to costs and disbursements from the first defendant of $37,652.71.  [5] The first and third defendants are entitled to costs from the plaintiff of $4,014.  [6] The first defendant is entitled to disbursements from the Plaintiff of $500.  Venning J  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV 2015-485-171 [2017] NZHC 2165  BETWEEN STANLEY ALLEN GILMOUR Plaintiff  AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS Respondent  Hearing: On Papers  Counsel: W G C Templeton for Plaintiff D Perkins for Respondent  Judgment: 7 September 2017  JUDGMENT OF ELLIS J  [1] On 22 June 2016 I dismissed Mr Gilmour's application for review and awarded costs to the respondents. The proceedings had previously been classified as 2B for costs purposes by an Associate Judge. I saw no reason to depart from that classification. But I directed that memoranda should be filed if agreement as to quantum could not be reached.  [2] The respondents took no steps to pursue the issue of costs pending Mr Gilmour's appeal to the Court of Appeal. That appeal was dismissed on 14 June 2017. 1 Mr Gilmour's application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was dismissed earlier this week.2  Gilmour v ChiefExecutive ofthe Department ofCorrections [2017] NZCA250. Gilmour v ChiefExecutive ofthe Department ofCorrections [2017] NZSC 133.  GILMOUR v CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS [2017] NZHC 2165 [7 September 2017]  [3] The respondent has quantified its 2B costs in accordance with the High Court Rules. Mr Gilmour disputes the quantum of the costs claimed, not because the relevant steps were not taken by the respondent but because he says a lesser amount should, for various reasons, be payable in relation to some of those steps. There has been an exchange of memoranda.  [4] As the respondent says, however, the whole point of the costs regime under the rules is predictability and expedition. The Court should not often be troubled by arguments about costs. None of these objects is achieved if the parties are permitted to take nice points about whether or not the time allocated by the rules for taking a particular step should be adjusted.  [5] The short point is that once the skill and experience level appropriate to the particular proceeding has been determined (as it has here) the relevant band determines what is regarded as a reasonable amount of time for each step. It is rare that costs calculated according to scale will equate to or exceed a party's actual costs and r 14.2(±) prevents recovery of more than the costs actually incurred.  [6] In my view, none of the matters raised on Mr Gilmour's behalf warrants departing from a costs award determined in accordance with the rules. I therefore make an order that the costs and disbursements payable by Mr Gilmour are as set out in the Schedule to the respondent's memorandum dated 2 August 2017, namely $24,665.10.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Date……………  Solicitors: CrawfordLaw,Wellington  MeredithConnell,Auckland  Minter Ellison RuddWatts,Auckland Copyto: REnright, Auckland  DUGGAN &ANOR vAUCKLANDCOUNCIL&ANOR [2017] NZHC 2138[4 September 2017]  [1] In the substantive judgment delivered on 5 July 2017 the Court awarded costs in favour of the defendants on a 2B basis. The Auckland Council seeks costs calculated on a 2B basis in the sum of $24,417.00 (including disbursements). The second defendants, the Costellos, seek costs on a 2B basis of $25,791.00 (which includes $1,484.00 for providing documents in response to the plaintiffs’ request relating to the construction contract and all written communications between the second defendants and their builder) together with $110.00 for disbursements. The second defendants also seek an uplift on scale costs of 50 per cent.  [2] The plaintiffs now accept the quantum claimed by the second defendants under 2B of $25,791.00 plus $110.00 for disbursements.   [3] The plaintiffs however submit that there should be no uplift in costs as sought by the second defendants and further that there should be a reduction in costs as the second defendants sought to introduce extraneous and unnecessary evidence into the proceeding.  [4] While the plaintiffs failed in their applications for judicial review increased costs are not justified. It cannot be said the proceeding was entirely without merit and should never have been brought. I accept the general criticism of the plaintiffs’ pleadings in that there were numerous particulars under each cause of action but the argument was more focused. I also accept that both parties were guilty of adducing evidence which was not directly related to the issues in the proceeding. On balance this is not a case for increased costs.    Result/orders  [5] The plaintiffs are to pay the first defendant Auckland Council costs in the sum of $24,417.00 (including disbursements).   [6] The plaintiffs are to pay the second defendants costs in the sum of $25,901.00 (including disbursements).  Venning J

B Costs of $2,500 are awarded to the respondents.     REASONS  [1] In August 2005 the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) declined an application made by Helilogging Ltd (Helilogging) for an exemption to allow it to use Wessex Mk2 helicopters for heli-logging. The current proceedings were issued in  CIVILAVIATIONAUTHORITYOF NEWZEALANDvHELILOGGING LIMITED (IN RECEIVERSHIP AND IN LIQUIDATION) [2017] NZSC 132[31August 2017]  September 2014. This, absent s 28 of the Limitation Act 1950, was outside the limitation period.1  [2] The CAA applied for summary judgment on all causes of action. This was granted in the High Court.2 That decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal.3 The Court of Appeal was satisfied that Helilogging had “pointed to sufficient material to give an air of reality to its claim for postponement of the limitation date.”4   Our assessment  [3] Whether s 28 of the Limitation Act applies has not been definitively decided by the Court of Appeal. That question is tied up with the particular facts which at this stage have not been the subject of findings. In these circumstances, we do not consider it in the interests of justice to grant the application for leave to appeal.5  Solicitors: Darroch Forrest, Wellington forApplicant Neilsons Lawyers Limited,Auckland for Respondents  1 It is conceded that, before the end of the limitation period, the respondents knew that they had grounds to challenge the CAA decision.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date……………  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE v REWITA[2017] NZHC 2111[31August 2017]  [1] In this proceeding the Commissioner of Police (the Commissioner) seeks orders under the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery)Act 2009(theAct).  The parties have reached agreement regarding the orders to be made, and now seek the Court’s approval in respect of the same under s 95 of theAct.  [2] The respondent, Mr Rewita, was found guilty of supplying or being in possession of supply of 221.2 grams of methamphetamine. He was selling this in one or two ounce lots for approximately $12,500 per ounce. The parties agree that during the relevant period of criminal activity Mr Rewita unlawfully benefited to the value of $97,500. This equates to 7.8 ounces at $12,500 per ounce. For that reason the parties agree that the maximum recoverable amount is $97,500.  [3] The total value of assets currently under restraint is $85,000. This comprises cash, motor vehicles, motorcycles and motorcycle parts that were seized during the course of the police investigation. The parties have agreed that all of the restrained property is to be disposed of under s 83(1) of the Act with the exception of a 1987 Harley Davidson motorcycle registration number 14WAB (having a value of $12,000) and assorted motorcycle parts that were seized from an address in Tokoroa on 12 June 2015. The value of those items is unknown. The motorcycle and motorcycle parts are to be returned to Mr Rewita once the Court has approved the settlement.  [4] I am satisfied that the orders that the parties seek are consistent with the purposes of the Act because they return much of the profit derived by Mr Rewita to the Crown. The Commissioner has agreed not to pursue Mr Rewita for the difference between the maximum recoverable amount and the total value of the forfeited property. This reflects the fact that litigation inevitably carries with it risk and expense that can be avoided if the parties reach agreement regarding the orders to be made.   [5] Igive the Court’s approval to the orders as sought.  Lang J

REASONS  [1] The Human Rights Commission has indicated its intention to apply to appear as intervener in the event leave is granted. We would be assisted by the Commission’s intervention and grant intervener status accordingly. The Commission’s submissions may address the general merits of the appeal.

[3] Wewould begrateful if counsel and Mr Taylor would confer on the order and timetable for the filing of submissions and submit an agreed memorandum or, if there is no agreement, separate memoranda setting out the areas agreed and not agreed. We suggest that this be attended to, at the latest, within 10 working days after the hearing date has been fixed and that the timetable should ensure all submissions are received by the Court at least 10 working days before the hearing date.

Ms Woodroffe advised that a meeting of the Paleae family was held on 24 August last, and that the family agreed to appoint Lole Paleae and Iese Tupu Paleae as additional trustees of the Paleae FamilyTrust.  [2] Both Lole and Iese are children of Mr and Mrs Paleae senior. They are Kristina and Ann’s siblings. Both are New Zealand citizens, and Ms Woodroffe advises that she has been instructed that neither has anycredit issues that could affect lending to the trust. Both are in employment and copies of letters confirming that have been made available.  [3] Counsel has also filed consents from both Lole and Iese, consenting to act as trustees of the trust, and undertaking to administer the trust in accordance with their duties as trustees.  [4] This gets over the difficulty noted by me in paragraph [30] of my interim judgment.  [5] Accordingly, I order that Tina Kristina Paleae, Anatasia Siauini, Lole Paleae and Iese Tupu Paleae be appointed as trustees of the Paleae Family Trust, in substitution for the existing trustees –Moana Paleae, Tiana Paleae, Ioane Paleae and Tina Paleae.  [6] I also order that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover their costs calculated on a 2B basis and their reasonable disbursements from the assets of the Paleae Family Trust. In the event that there is any difficulty in calculating costs or disbursements, the issue is to be referred to the Registrar.  Wylie J

[2] At the outset of the hearing Mr Edwards advised me that he wished to seek leave to discontinue his proceeding.  EDWARDS v THE DISTRICT COURT AT LOWER HUTT [2017] NZHC 2036 [24 August 2017]  [3] I explained to Mr Edwards that by discontinuing his proceeding it would be struck out and his proceeding in the High Court would be at an end. He confirmed to me that was his wish.  [4] Mr Edwards' application was not opposed by Mr Robinson on behalf of Westpac New Zealand Ltd (Westpac).  [5] Westpac was present as an interested party but did not seek costs.  [6] I have granted Mr Edwards' application to discontinue the proceeding. It is struck out. There are no orders as to costs.

Before formally closing the Crown’s case, Ms Sheridan sought to see me in Chambers and applied to amend a number of the charges.  The application related to charges 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17, and to a split of charge 2 into two separate charges.   [2] The amendments to charges 13 and 15 were not opposed. I granted the application in relation to those two charges by consent. Mr Tomlinson, on behalf of Mr Moeke, opposed amendment to charges 14, 16 and 17 and to the splitting of charge 2 into two separate charges. Mr Gowing also opposed the splitting of charge2 into two separate charges.  Ireserved mydecision on those charges.  [3] In the course of the Chambers hearing, I also heard applications on behalf of both defendants for dismissal of charges pursuant to s 147 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011. The application on behalf of Mr Moeke was made in relation to charge26, and charges 5to 15 and charges 18 and 19. Theapplication on behalf of Ms Karauria relates to charges 20 to 24.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 36/2017 [2017] NZSC 121   BETWEEN  MATTHEW RICHARD BROWN Applicant   AND  NEW ZEALAND POLICE Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, Glazebrook and Ellen France JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person M H Cooke for Respondent   Judgment:  18 August 2017    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant challenges a judgment of the Court of Appeal1 refusing him leave to appeal against two High Court judgments2 both of which dismissed appeals following conviction on two separate counts of trespass.3  [2] The first trespass incident took place in the executive wing of the parliamentary complex in Wellington. Following a previous protest action there, the applicant had been issued with a trespass notice effective for two years. Four months after the notice was issued, the applicant returned and advised security that he was there in breach of the trespass notice. He was arrested after he refused to leave.  1 Brown v New Zealand Police [2017] NZCA71 (KósP, BrownandWilliams JJ) [Brown (CA)].  2 Brown v New Zealand Police [2016] NZHC 2359 (Clark J); and Brown v New Zealand Police [2016] NZHC 2884 (Mander J).  3 The appeal heard by Clark J related to conviction. The other appeal was against conviction and sentence.  MATTHEWRICHARD BROWN v NEWZEALANDPOLICE [2017] NZSC 121[18August 2017]  [3] The second incident related to trespass at a Dunedin supermarket. Mr Brown deliberately breached the notice. He then went to the police station, told them of the breach and asked to be arrested, which he was.  [4] In the Court of Appeal, the applicant’s main argument was that the original trespass notice in the Dunedin incident was invalid because no unlawful act preceded it. This aspect had been addressed by Mander J and the Court of Appeal saw no error in the approach taken or any matter of public or general importance in the circumstances requiring a second appeal.4 In this Court, the focus of Mr Brown’s written submissions is on concerns he has about the way in which his complaints have been dealt with in other cases.5  [5] Under s 213(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, the judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing the application for leave to appeal is “final”, which precludes an appeal to this Court from that decision.6 Nor would we be prepared to grant leave for a leap-frog appeal (that is, direct from the High Court judgments) given that there are no exceptional circumstances in this case that would justify such an appeal, as is required. In these circumstances there is no need to have an oral hearing of this application as Mr Brown sought.  [6] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent  4 Brown (CA),  above n  1,  at [5].   5 In reliance on doctor’s certificates, Mr Brown sought and was given opportunities to file submissions in reply to those of the respondent.

REASONS  [1] The evidence as to what is likely to happen to the applicant should he be required to stay in Australia for longer than two years which was adduced in the District Court was limited. It may be that there will be agreement as to what the  MAYTHEM KAMILRADHI vTHE DISTRICTCOURTATMANUKAU [2017] NZSC 123[18August 2017]  likely consequences for the applicant would be.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND TAURANGA REGISTRY CRI-2016-087-000738 [2017] NZHC 1978  THE QUEEN  v   SHANE CHRISTOPHER NEIL  Hearing: 28 Julyand 18August 2017 (Heard at HAMILTON)  Appearances: R Jenson for Crown R Laybourn for Defendant  Sentence: 18 August 2017  [FINAL] SENTENCING REMARKS OF LANG J  R vNEIL[2017] NZHC 1978 [18August 2017]  [1] On 30 June2017 Idelivered sentencingremarks in the High Court at Rotorua in which I found that an end sentence of one year 11 months imprisonment was an appropriate end sentence for you.1 That brought you within the range of a sentence of home detention. For the reasons set out in my sentencing remarks at that time, I considered that a sentence of home detention would be appropriate provided you could find a suitable address.2  [2] Not without some difficulty, you have now obtained a suitable address at which to serve a sentence of home detention. You will be living at that address in Hamilton with your mother. The EM bail assessors have visited the address and confirm that it is technically suitable for a grant of EM bail, and also that the occupants are suitable for such a grant. I am therefore satisfied it is appropriate to sentence you to serve a sentence of home detention at that address.  [3] I take into account the fact that you have now been subject to restrictive bail conditions for some time. I therefore impose a sentence of ten months home detention to be served at the nominated address.  The conditions of that sentence will be as per the conditions contained in the EM bail assessor’s report. In addition, I impose a further condition that you are not to be in possession of, or consume, alcohol or non-prescription drugs for the duration of the sentence.  [4] Stand down.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  CA319/2017 [2017] NZCA 353   BETWEEN H INVESTMENTS LIMITED (IN LIQUIDATION) Appellant  AND OFFICIALASSIGNEE Respondent  Counsel: M D Branch for Appellant PV Cornegé for Respondent  Judgment: 16 August 2017 at 3.00 pm (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OFMILLER J (Review of Registrar’s Decision)   The applicationfor review is declined.   REASONS  [1] This judgment responds to an application for review of a Registrar’s decision to decline to waive a filing fee for this appeal.  [2] The appellant company is in liquidation, but the proceeding is not brought by the liquidators in their own names. They have chosen rather to bring the proceeding in the name of the company. The Deputy Registrar’s reason for refusing the application for waiver was that liquidators should be personally liable for the payment of fees. He accepted that the appellant does not have readily available assets.  H INVESTMENTS LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) vOFFICIALASSIGNEE [2017] NZCA353[16August 2017]  [3] The application for review is brought on the ground that the liquidators should not be required to fund the filing fee, so incurring a liability for a debt of the company. The liquidators say that it is in the best interest of the creditors to challenge the decision of the Official Assignee that is the subject of the judgment under appeal. The liquidators believe they have a claim against the company’s director. The director is bankrupt, and the Official Assignee rejected the liquidators’ claim. In the High Court AssociateJudge Sargisson dismissed an application foran order that theAssignee be required to accept the liquidators’ proof of debt.1  [4] I accept that the Deputy Registrar was wrong insofar as he reasoned that the liquidators are personally liable to pay filing fees.  Theyare liable where proceedings are brought in their own names, but not where proceedings are brought in the name of the company in liquidation. This Court has accepted in the past that companies mayapplyfor a waiver of a filing fee.2  [5] However, it does not follow that a waiver ought to be granted where the company is in liquidation, even if the company has no readily available assets with which to pay. The liquidators do have the option of paying the fee themselves, in which case the payment will form part of their expenses in the liquidation, or asking the creditors of the company to fund the payment. There is no reason why the state should effectively subsidise resolution of this dispute by waiving filing fees.  [6] The application for review is declined.

     IN THE DISTRICT COURT  AT MANUKAU    CRI-2017-092-007303    [2017] NZDC 28722        MINISTRY OF PRIMARY INDUSTRIES     Prosecutor    v        NOFOKAUALU OKUSI MALANI  Defendant            Hearing:     11 August 2017       Appearances:     J Priest for the Prosecutor  M Mellin for the Defendant      Judgment:     11 August 2017          NOTES OF JUDGE R J McILRAITH ON SENTENCING     [1] Mr Petelo and Mr Malani, you will have heard that discussion.  You pleaded guilty to the charge that each of you face which is the charge of possessing shellfish in contravention of the Fisheries Act 1996, namely more than three times the daily limit of cockles.     [2] The summary of facts has been accepted.  You were part of a group of a number of people to whom you are related who on 14 January this year collected some 3024 cockles from a beach at Potts Road in Whitford.  Those cockles were then placed in four white plastic paint containers in the boot of a vehicle, that vehicle being a Subaru vehicle, registration number [number deleted].  It is accepted by the Ministry for Primary Industries that neither of you was motivated by any commercial intent.  In other words this was gathering for a family purpose.  Nevertheless the amount that    was gathered was obviously greatly in excess of the daily entitlement per person which is of course 50.   [3] Ms Priest for the Ministry has addressed me in relation to the provisions of the Fisheries Act and you will have heard her go through the very good reasons as to why these provisions are in place, to protect the cockle beds for all citizens and for future citizens.  The question here in terms of sentence is simply what level of fine should be imposed.     [4] Mr Mellin has submitted on your behalf that rather than (inaudible: 10:46:34) a fine is the most appropriate outcome.  I have been provided with a schedule of fines imposed in similar cases.  I accept the starting point for each of you as being a fine of $1000.  From that you are entitled to a discount for your guilty plea and of course a discount for your prior good characters.  I accept that you have no convictions for similar offending in the past.  Taking those two facts into account I think the appropriate end point is a fine of $600 each in addition to $130 Court costs each.  The fine is to be paid at the rate of $20 per week commencing from next week.     [5] The second issue that arises is the issue of forfeiture of the vehicle.  An order for forfeiture is made for the vehicle pursuant to the provisions of the Fisheries Act s 255C(2)(c).  Ms Priest has quite properly advised me that the Ministry will not stand in the way of possession being retained of the vehicle (inaudible: 10:47:47) needs to occur and they will not oppose an application for relief against forfeiture by the owner of the vehicle whom I understand to be a third party who was not involved in your offending.

B The approved question is whether the applicants have an interest in the Oyang 75 for the purposes of s 256 of the Fisheries Act 1996.  REASONS  [1] Although leave to appeal has been granted in general terms and we are not restricting the arguments which may be advanced on the approved question, we wish to hear from counsel on the following line of argument:  (a) the Oyang 75 is “forfeit property” for the purposes of s 256 of the FisheriesAct 1996;  RUDI HARTONO AND OTHERS v MINISTRYFOR PRIMARYINDUSTRIES [2017] NZSC117[9August 2017]  (b)  the applicants individually are within the expression “any fishing crew” in (b)(ii) of the definition of “interest”;1   (c)  they have claims for “unpaid wages”;   (d)  in respect of those claims, they had, prior to forfeiture, in rem rights in respect of the Oyang 75; and   (e)  such rights are within the contemplation of the expression “an interest … that any fishing crew have in unpaid wages”.

EDITORIAL NOTE: CHANGES MADE TO THIS JUDGMENTAPPEAR IN [SQUARE BRACKETS].  IN THE DISTRICT COURT ATMANUKAU  CRI-2016-092-011767 [2017] NZDC 17536    THE QUEEN  v   DOUGLAS JOHN HARVEY  Date of Ruling: 7 August 2017  Appearances: J Eng for the Crown T Massyn and M Sweetman for the Defendant  Judgment: 7 August 2017   RULING OFJUDGE D J MCNAUGHTON  [1] This is an application on the morning of trial bythe defendant,Mr Harvey, for an order directing the registrar to obtain and disclose to counsel occupations of the jury panel. These occupations are shown as “Not Stated”. Counsel advises that in relation to today’s jurylist the proportion of peoplein that list with occupationunstated is significant, perhaps up to a third.   [2] Rule 401 Jury Rules 1990 provides that every jury list provided by the Electoral Commission to the Chief Executive of the Ministryof Justice under s 10 of the Act must include particulars including occupation.   [3] The difficulty is that a fair proportion of electors do not disclose their occupation on the electoral roll and therefore the information contained in our jury lists is not complete.  R vDOUGLAS JOHN HARVEY[2017] NZDC 17536[7August 2017]  [4] This issue has been raised already by MrWhite of the Public Defence Service in other trials. He apparently managed to persuade both [Judges] to direct the registry to make enquiries of those persons in the panel whose occupation was not stated, to disclose their occupation, that information was then handwritten into the list and disclosed to counsel.  [5] I expect that, as in the present case, those were applications made on the day. I have not had time to properly research the matter. There is a panel waiting but it seemstomethat nowherein this application isthereanybasisfortheCourt to exercise the power beingsought. Whetherthe registryispreparedto go theextrastep and make enquiries in relation to jurors’ occupations is a matter for the registry.  [6] I do not see that I have any power to intervene in the matter or compel those enquiries to be made particularly where resources are as thinly stretched in the Court as theypresentlyare, essentiallyto breakingpoint. I am not going to make adecision placing any further burden on the staff without a solid statutory basis to do so.  [7] The principal basis for making this application is that there may be people on the jury list whose occupations are not stated who fall within a prohibited class of jurors, lawyers, Judges, CommunityMagistrates, J.P.’s and soon. It isdifficult to see in practice how that might be the case but I suppose, potentially, there is a remote possibility that that could occur.   [8] Defence counsel may challenge jurors for cause on the basis that they fall within a prohibited class. If counsel wishes to make a challenge of that kind I have indicated I would simply ask the juror to step to the bench, enquire whether their occupation falls within the prohibited class and if it does not they would then take a seat on the juryunless they were otherwise challenged, but that would not involve me disclosing the juror’s occupation in open Court to counsel.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2015-485-611680 [2017] NZHC 1795  IN THE ESTATE OF ANTTI MATIAS NURMELA  Hearing: On the papers Judgment: 1 August 2017  JUDGMENT OF CULL J  [1] The applicant is the administrator of the estate of Antti Matias Nurmela, pursuant to a grant of letters of administration dated 12 October 2015, made under s 9A(2) of the Administration Act 1969 (the Act) to the attorney of a person entitled, who has become mentally incapable.  [2] The person entitled who became mentally incapable, Hely Siru Nurmela, died on 22 April 2016. The applicant is the sole surviving executor under the last will and testament of Hely Siru Nurmela.  [3] The applicant filed an application under s 9B(2) of the Act for the Court's directions and Brown J made the following orders:  (a)  the applicant is to continue to act as administrator upon the letters of administration of the estate of the deceased, Antti Matias Nurmela, dated 12 October 2015 for a period of a further six months;   (b)  leave is reserved to the applicant to apply to extend the period of his administration if circumstances so require.    IN THE ESTATE OF ANTTI MATIAS NURMELA [2017] NZHC 1795 [l August 2017]  [4] The applicant has filed a further application for directions, seeking further time to apply for probate for the estate of Hely Siru Nurmela and then a new grant of letters of administration in his capacity as administrator of the estate.  [5] In an affidavit filed in support of the application, the applicant describes the claims against the estate of the deceased, which are yet to be resolved. The applicant had hoped that the claims may have been able to be resolved within the timeframe for the extended grant of administration in which case the estate could have been promptly wound up.  [6] In the circumstances, with the proceedings still extant, a further extension of a grant of letters of administration is required and I accordingly make an order in terms of the without notice of application for directions in the following terms:  (a)  the court directs the applicant to continue to act as administrator upon the letters of administration of the estate of the deceased, Antti Matias Nurmela, dated 12 October 2015 for a period of a further six months;   (b)  leave is further reserved to the applicant to apply to extend the period of his administration if circumstances so require.    
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY   CIV-2017-485-7   [2017] NZHC 1729   UNDER  section 18 of the Broadcasting Act 1989   IN THE MATTER  of an appeal from a decision of the   Broadcasting Standards Authority   (No 2016-072 dated 2 December 2016)   BETWEEN  ARCHIBALD NORMAN LOWES   Appellant   AND  MEDIAWORKS TV LIMITED   Respondent   On the papers    Counsel: AN Lowes in Person T E G Tmion for Respondent  Judgment: 25 July 2017  JUDGMENT OF THOMAS J  [1] By my decision dated 29 May 2017, I dismissed Mr Lowes' appeal against a decision of the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) regarding inaccuracies in a Media Works broadcast.1  [2] In my conclusion, I made some observations as to what might be considered the utility of Mr Lowes' identification of inaccuracies in the patiicular broadcast. Given those observations, I suggested Media Works might well consider costs should lie where they fall.  [3] Media Works has now filed a memorandum in respect of costs. Rather reluctantly, it accepts my suggestion, although it repeats its view that the appeal  Lowes v Media Works TV Limited [2017] NZHC 1130.  LOWES v MEDIA WORKS TV LIMITED [2017) NZHC 1729 [25 July 2017)  should have been avoided given Media Works' Standards Committee acknowledged the inaccuracy in the broadcast in relation to Mr Lowes' initial complaint on 26 August 2016.  [4] Media Works also notes it has tried to limit Mr Lowes' potential cost exposure throughout the proceeding and did not instruct counsel to appear on its behalf. It does, however, seek as a disbursement the cost of in-house counsel's travel from Auckland to Wellington and return. These costs total $606.79.  [5] Mr Lowes has filed a memorandum in response, submitting MediaWorks should bear "a share of the costs" and repeating his criticism of the inaccuracies of the broadcast. He also contends Mr Turton, in-house counsel at MediaWorks, went to Media Works' Wellington office that day "to update their employees, so he was on company business that day".  [6] Costs are at the discretion of the Court. I acknowledge Media Works' reservations as to the way in which Mr Lowes has conducted himself in these proceedings but nevertheless consider the decision not to pursue costs is an appropriate one in the circumstances. That is not to say this is the approach which will always be taken by the Court if inaccuracies are acknowledged and rectified at an early date.  [7] I do, however, consider it appropriate to award Media Works the costs of its disbursements. It was successful in the appeal and I accept it minimised its costs by using in-house counsel to appear. It should not, however, be out of pocket and it is awarded the disbursements of $606.79. They are reasonable and reasonably necessary for the proceedings.  [8] I note the Court holds $1,115 by way of security for costs. These funds are to be paid to the parties in accordance with this decision, with the result $606.79 is to be paid to Media Works and the balance refunded to Mr  
    IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  GISBORNE REGISTRY    CRI 2017-416-8  [2017] NZHC 1710       BETWEEN     WADE LAWRENCE CRESSWELL  Appellant      AND     NEW ZEALAND POLICE  Respondent       Hearing:     11 July 2017, further material received on 14 and 20 July 2017      Counsel:     B Shackell for Appellant C R Stuart for Respondent      Judgment:     21 July 2017         JUDGMENT OF  ELLIS J    [1] Mr Cresswell was sentenced to two years and one month’s imprisonment on 16 May 2017, having pleaded guilty to a charge of demanding with intent to steal.  He subsequently appealed that sentence.     [2] At the hearing of his appeal on 11 July it became apparent that things may have gone awry at an earlier point in time, prior to the entry Mr Cresswell’s plea.  I do not intend to go into detail today.  For immediate purposes it suffices to record that the upshot is:   (a) Mr Cresswell was given leave to appeal his conviction out of time and has since filed that appeal, together with a supporting affidavit;   (b) the Crown agrees that the appeal should be allowed on the grounds that a miscarriage of justice has occurred;   (c) the nature of the miscarriage is such that the Crown agrees that it will not be seeking a retrial.     [3] Mr Cresswell’s appeal against conviction is allowed and his conviction is quashed.     [4] More detailed reasons will follow in due course.     [5] I thank both counsel for their assistance.  Mr Cresswell owes a debt of gratitude to Ms Shackell.      _________________________  Rebecca Ellis J    Solicitors:  Woodward Chrisp, Gisborne for Appellant  Crown Solicitors’ Office, Gisborne for Respondent

B The judgment is recalled and reissued to include the following order:  An order is made under s 80I(2) of the Sentencing Act 2002 granting the appellant leave to apply to the District Court for cancellation of the sentence of imprisonment and substitution of a sentence of home detention.  The judgment is otherwise confirmed.  REASONS OFTHE COURT  (Given by Brown J)  ERICKSON v MINISTRYFOR PRIMARYINDUSTRIES [2017] NZCA312[20 July2017]  [1] In Erickson v Ministry for Primary Industries1 this Court allowed the appellant’s appeal against sentence and substituted a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment. An application for recall seeking to have this Court address the question of home detention was declined for the reason that any application for commutation to home detention should be made in the District Court with appropriate supporting information.  [2] In a joint memorandum, counsel now advise that the District Court does not have jurisdiction to hear an application for home detention unless leave of this Court is first granted.2 A further application for recall is made on that ground.  [3] We are satisfied that recall is justified in these circumstances. The application for recall of this Court’s judgment dated 29 June 2017 ([2017] NZCA  271) is granted.   [4] The judgment is recalled and reissued to include the following order: “An order is made under s 80I(2) of the SentencingAct 2002 granting the appellant leave to apply to the District Court for cancellation of the sentence of imprisonment and substitution of a sentence of home detention.”  [5] The judgment is otherwise confirmed.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar ……………………………………  Solicitors / Counsel: Mr RJB Fowler QC (for the applicant), Barrister,Wellington Mr LCollins (applicant’sinstructing solicitor), Collins&MayLaw, Solicitors, Lower Hutt Mr CJRBaird (for the respondent), Barrister,Auckland Mr R McLeod (respondent’sinstructing solicitor), McLeod &Associates, Solicitors,Auckland  CROSS v CROSS[2017] NZHC 1638 [17July2017]  [1] I refer to my judgment issued on 12 June 2017. I dismissed Mrs Cross’ application and held that Mr Cross was entitled to his reasonable costs and disbursements. I indicated the preliminary view that costs should be assessed on a 2B basis, and invited counsel to agree the same.  [2] I have received brief memoranda from counsel. Counsel for Mr Cross seeks costs on a 2B basis. Thetotal sought is $6,195.00.  [3] Counsel for Mrs Cross does not oppose costs being ordered in this amount.  [4] Accordingly, I order costs against Mrs Cross, and in favour of Mr Cross, in the sum of $6,195.00.  Wylie J 
IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  CA249/2017 [2017] NZCA 295  BETWEEN JOZSEF GABOR SZEKELY Appellant  AND SAMUEL RAYMOND NORTH First Respondent  DEBBIE VIVIAN NORTH Second Respondent  Counsel: Q S Haines forAppellant First Respondent in person  Judgment: 11 July 2017 at 10.00 am (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OFFRENCH J Review of Registrar’s Decision  The application for review of the Registrar’s decision declining to grant the appellant a refund offiling fees is declined.   REASONS  [1] When Mr Szekely’s lawyer filed the notice of appeal in this case on 12May2017, healso paid the filingfee of $1,100.00. Mr Szekely subsequently sought a refund of the fee.  This was declined by the Registrar.  [2] Mr Szeleky now seeks areview of the Registrar’s decision.  SZEKELYv NORTH [2017] NZCA295[11 July2017]  [3] In support of his application for review, Mr Szekely relies on an affidavit sworn by a Mr Corke. However, the affidavit concerns Mr Corke’s own dealings with the respondents and his adverse view of the respondents. It is irrelevant for present purposes.  [4] The second argument advanced by Mr Szekely is that he is in debt as a result of this litigation and it is the respondents who are to blame for that state of affairs because they have seriously misled the Court.  [5] I accept, as did the Registrar, that Mr Szekely has a large amount of debt comprised mainly of legal fees and costs arising out of this litigation. Whether the respondents have seriously misled the Court is, however, for another day. It cannot be determined at this stage. What matters at this stage as regards filing fees is that although Mr Szekely has debt, he also has a not insignificant income. I am satisfied he is able to pay the filing fees.  [6] I note too that Mr Szekely has stated he will continue with the proceeding regardless of the outcome regarding payment of filing fees.  [7] Finally I am satisfied the appeal does not concern a matter of genuine public interest within the meaning of reg 5(4) of the Court of Appeal Fees Regulations 2001.  [8] Accordingly I confirm the Registrar’s decision as correct and decline the application for review.  Solicitors: Q H Law, LevinforAppellant  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 29/2017 [2017] NZSC 108   BETWEEN  ALISTER JAMES REID Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Court:  William Young, O'Regan and Ellen France JJ   Counsel:  J S Jefferson forApplicant JA Eng for Respondent   Judgment:  7 July 2017    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant was found guilty at trial of aggravated robbery and demanding with menaces. The victim having died in a motorcycle accident before trial, the Crown relied as part of its case on the account of events given by the victim to a detective. Pre-trial challenges to the admissibility of this evidence were dismissed bythe District Court1and Court ofAppeal.2 Theapplicant has appealed to the Court of Appeal against his sentence but seeks leave to appeal direct to this Court against conviction. The submissions on his behalf are directed primarily to the pre-trial decision of the Court of Appeal upholding the admissibility of the detective’s evidence.  [2] The proposed appeal does not meet the stringent test fora leap frog appeal. It would necessarily require considerable attention to be paid to what happened at trial,  1 R v Biles DCNapier CRI-2013-020-3266,14 November 2014 (Judge Adeane). 2 Reid v R [2015] NZCA175 (Wild, Clifford and DobsonJJ).

[2] The Crown should identify in its submissions which of the sexual acts that took place on 29 March 2015 was the alleged rape that is the subject of the charge.

B Order prohibiting publication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in news media or on the internet or other publicly available database until final disposition of trial. Publication in law report or law digest permitted.  REASONS  [1] Mr Bailey is charged with the possession of methamphetamine for supply1 and of possession of explosives (ammunition) other than for a lawful, proper and sufficient purpose.2  Misuse ofDrugsAct 1975, s 6(1).  MATTHEWNOELBAILEYvR [2017] NZSC 103 [3 July2017]  [2] The evidence for those charges was gathered from Mr Bailey’s person and vehicle (or nearby). As to the items from the vehicle, some of the items were found in the boot of the car and some were found when a torch was shone through the vehicle’s windows after the vehicle was stopped by the police for what was held in the District Court to be an improper purpose.3 The District Court also held that MrBailey’s subsequent arrest was unjustified.4  [3] In the District Court all of the evidence was excluded by the judge after the balancing exercise under s 30 of the Evidence Act 2006.5 That decision was overturned in part by the Court of Appeal so that all but the items found on MrBailey’s person were admitted.6 MrBailey seeks leave to appeal against that decision.  Result  [4] No sufficient basis has been put forward by Mr Bailey to support the proposition that the proposed appeal should be heard pre-trial. There will be nothing to stop Mr Bailey raising similar issues in any later appeal, should he be convicted.   [5] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.   [6] For fair trial reasons we make an order prohibiting publication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in the news media or on the internet or other publicly available database until final disposition of trial.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 21/2017 [2017] NZSC 100   BETWEEN  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON Applicant   AND  JUDICIAL CONDUCT COMMISSIONER First Respondent   JUSTICES ELIAS, YOUNG, GLAZEBROOK, ARNOLDAND O'REGAN Second Respondents   Court:  Elias CJ, William Young and Ellen France JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person C PA Cross for First Respondent H M Carrad for Second Respondents   Judgment:  29 June 2017    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for recall is dismissed.  B The application for review is dismissed.  C The Registrar is directed not to accept for filing any further applications in relation to this matter.    REASONS  [1] On 16 May 2017, this Court dismissed Mr Rabson’s application for leave to appeal against the decision of a single Judge in the Court of Appeal in relation to security for costs.1 On 23 June 2017, this Court dismissed an application for recall of that decision.2  1 Rabson v Judicial Conduct Commissioner [2017] NZSC74. 2 Rabson v Judicial Conduct Commissioner [2017] NZSC96.  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON v JUDICIALCONDUCTCOMMISSIONER [2017] NZSC 100[29 June 2017]  [2] The applicant has filed what appears to be another application for recall.  This application is the same as the previous recall application.3 As such it is an abuse of process and is dismissed.  [3] Mr Rabson has also filed what purports to be “an application for review” under s 28(2) of the Supreme Court Act 2003.4  [4] The background to this application need only be briefly summarised. Essentially, Mr Rabson took issue with the intituling used by the Registrar in the reference line in a letter relating to the application for leave. Mr Rabson objected.  The matter was referred to a Judge. Ellen France J directed the Registrar he should allow the applicant to use the intituling he sought to use (which reflected that used in the Court of Appeal judgment in this matter).5 Mr Rabson was advised of this direction. Further correspondence between Mr Rabson and the Registrar followed.  Then, on 11 May2017, Mr Rabson filed the application for review referred to above. The application sought a copy of the Judge’s ruling “overturning the Registrar’s refusal to properly name the proposed respondents”.   [5] Assuming for these purposes that a review was available under s 28(2), it is apparent from this summary that the application of 11 May is an abuse of process. The initial action of the Registrar was inconsequential. Mr Rabson was advised of the Judge’s direction. Moreover, the outcomewas exactlyas Mr Rabson had sought.  The application for review is dismissed.   [6] The Registrar is directed not to accept for filing any further applications in relation to this matter.

The defendants seek costs. Their memorandum has complied with my direction. They seek costs for the period following 29 November 2013 and have provided the relevant invoices. They have also provided details of their disbursements and of settlement offers they made.  [2] The plaintiff submits he should not be ordered to pay costs because the defendants triggered the claim, did not enter into meaningful settlement discussions and did not disclose material information to the Court. I do not accept this  SZEKELYv MUSE ON ALLEN LIMITED [2017] NZHC 1468 [29 June 2017]  submission. The plaintiff brought this proceeding and failed. The defendants have provided evidence of without prejudice save as to costs offers which were made. note especially the offer made on 19 June 2015, the terms of which were reasonable. The earlier offer of 7 June 2015 also contained reasonable options for settlement. Whether the information said not to be disclosed is material will be a matter for the Court ofAppeal if an appeal is pursued.  [3] The plaintiff also says the legal costs were incuned by Muse on Allen Ltd, which is now in liquidation, and not by the Norths personally. I accept the plaintiff is correct that these costs may not be claimed. Relief had been claimed against the company, but it subsequently went into liquidation. The liquidators did not consent to the litigation and relief was not pursued.  [4] However Samuel North incuned disbursements of $687.53 (inclusive of GST) in the preparation of documents for the hearing. He also incurred disbursements of $7,143.38 (inclusive of GST) in expert fees. The plaintiff is ordered to pay these two sums totalling $7,830.91.  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 21/2017 [2017] NZSC 96   BETWEEN  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON Applicant   AND  JUDICIAL CONDUCT COMMISSIONER First Respondent   JUSTICES ELIAS, YOUNG, GLAZEBROOK, ARNOLDAND O'REGAN Second Respondents   Court:  Elias CJ, William Young and Ellen France JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person C PA Cross for First Respondent H M Carrad for Second Respondents   Judgment:  23 June 2017    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks an order recalling our judgment of 16 May 2017 declining his application for leave to appeal against a decision of a single Judge in the Court of Appeal in relation to security for costs.1 In support of this application, he has raised what we see as two issues:2  (a) two members of the leave panel are respondents to the application for leave to appeal; and  1 Rabson v Judicial Conduct Commissioner [2017] NZSC74.  2 We regard all points raised by the applicant, most recently in an affidavit of 22 June 2017, as encompassed bythe two issues we have identified.  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON v JUDICIALCONDUCTCOMMISSIONER [2017] NZSC 96[23 June 2017]  (b) the leave judgment referred to the underlying High Court decision under challenge in the Court of Appeal as being “a minute of WilliamsJ striking out the second respondents as parties to proceedings”3 by way of review of a decision of the Judicial Conduct Commissioner but did not identify that his primary complaint in respect of that decision was the order for costs which was made.  [2] The Court has taken the view that leave applications are required to be dealt with by permanent judges of the Court.4 Four of the five permanent judges of the Court are second respondents to the appeal. The doctrine of necessity thus applied. The Court was well aware that the aspect of the minute which the applicant wished to challenge was the order for costs. But, for the purposes of the leave decision, what was primarily important was the decision of the Court ofAppeal judge.  [3] The recall application is therefore dismissed.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND PALMERSTON NORTH REGISTRY  On the papers  Judgment:  IN THE MATTER OF AND IN THE MATTER OF  BETWEEN  AND  22 June 2017  CIV 2015-454-20 [2017] NZHC 1385  the Family Protection Act 1955  the estate of Paul Leon Gerard Van Moeseke  LUCIUS CORNELIUS PAULUS VAN MOESEKE Plaintiff  CHARLES JOHN ANDREWS AND JOHN HAMISH FREEBAIRN Defendants   JUDGMENT OF MALLON J  [1] Mr Van Moeseke has brought a claim under the Family Protection Act 1955 seeking an order from the Comi that provision be made for him out of his father's estate. Mr Van Moeseke's father died on 26 May 2014. He left a will dated 10 April 2014. Probate of the will was granted to the defendants on 15 July 2014. The estate has a value of approximately $3.6 million. The deceased made no provision for Mr Van Moeseke. Mr Van Moeseke is the deceased's only child.  [2] Mr Van Moeseke has financial needs which are compounded by his health difficulties. These needs and his health difficulties are set out in the affidavits that have been filed. The basis on which an order under the Family Protection Act 1955 is sought is the failure of the deceased to make, out of the abundance of his resources, a provision sufficient for the proper maintenance of Mr Van Moeseke.  VAN MOESEKE v ANDREWS [2017] NZHC 1385 [22 June 2017]  [3] All relevant paiiies have reached an agreement pursuant to which two of the deceased's prope1iies are to be transfened to Mr Van Moeseke. In addition he is to receive a fmiher provision of $1,040,000 from the estate (inclusive of an interim payment of $500,000 already made). This agreement means that two charities will receive less than that provided under the deceased's will. They consent to this.  [4] I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make provision for Mr Van Moeseke out of the deceased's estate pursuant to s 4 of the Family Protection Act 1955. Accordingly the draft order provided with the joint memorandum of counsel dated 8 June 2017 may be sealed.   \JUA  j Mallon J

[2] This proceeding was categorised as 2 for the purposes of costs. In written submissions at the time of the substantive hearing the Minister signalled his intention to seek costs on a 2B basis in the event that the application failed.  The applicants did not address the issue of costs. The Minister has now requested that a costs order be made. His memorandum addressing this request was forwarded to the applicants’ counsel but she no longer has instructions.  [3] In the circumstances, the Minister should have a costs order. There are to be costs payable on a 2B basis in accordance with the schedule attached to counsel’s memorandum. These total $6,132.50, together with disbursements totalling $1,012.53.

B The applicant must pay costs to the respondents of $2,500.    REASONS  [1] In 2002, the applicant, a software development company, raised capital via an offering of preference shares to existing shareholders which were to convert to ordinary shares. The shares were to carry preferential dividends of 15 per cent per annum and these were to be paid at the time of conversion. It was envisaged that conversion would occur two years after the issue of the preference shares but this was subject to provisions providing for acceleration and, more relevantly, postponement, which was to occur if the applicant was not able to pay the preferential dividends at that time, that is two years after the issue of the preference shares.  ACTIVEDOCS LIMITED v CADRE INVESTMENTS LIMITED, MICHAELWILLIAM SCOTT STANBRIDGE ANDTREASURYMERCHANTFINANCE LIMITED [2017] NZSC 91 [20 June 2017]  [2] As it turned out, the applicant was not able to pay the preferential dividends at the proposed conversion date. In 2013, it purported to convert the preference shares but on the basis that it was liable to pay preference dividends for two years only, that is that the applicant’s maximum liability for preferential dividends was 30 per cent of the face value of the shares.  [3] In question is whether the preferential dividends continued to accrue until conversion. This question was answered in the affirmative in the High Court by Courtney J1 and her decision was upheld in the Court of Appeal.2  [4] The case turns on the interpretation of a resolution of the shareholders of 2 September 2002 and a Short Form prospectus. While it is the case that in the High Court, Courtney J referred to a general presumption that preference share dividends accrue cumulatively,3 this consideration did not feature in the reasoning of the Court of Appeal. The issue involved is thus very particular and, contrary to the submissions of counsel for the applicant, there is no question of public or general importance or commercial significance involved. It was not contended that the miscarriage of justice ground is engaged and in any event we see no appearance of an error of the kind which might warrant the grant of leave on this ground.  [5] The application for leave is therefore dismissed.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CIV-2016-404-001844 [2017] NZHC 1359  BETWEEN KYLE Appellant  AND BOWEN Respondent  Hearing: On the papers  Judgment: 20 June 2017  JUDGMENT OF COURTNEY J  This judgment was delivered byJusticeCourtney on20 June2017 at 4.30pm pursuant to R 11.5 oftheHigh Court Rules  Registrar / DeputyRegistrar  Date………………………  KYLE vBOWEN [2017] NZHC 1359[20June2017]  [1] In my decision of 19 December 2016 I granted the appellant leave to appeal from Judge Pidwell’s decision regarding schooling arrangements for the parties’son, X, but dismissed the appeal. The respondent has applied for costs. I note that the memorandum by counsel for the respondent was filed on 3 April 2017 and the reply by the appellant’s counsel on 23 May 2017. Regrettably, an error in the Registry meant that the matter was not referred to me promptly.  [2] The respondent seeks costs on a 2B basis, which she calculates at $9,366 together with disbursements of $200. Mr Ashmore, for the appellant, does not quarrel with the calculation of costs.  He does, however, invite me to reduce the costs on the basis that, although the appellant was ultimately successful, there were errors in the original judgment that led to my granting leave to appeal. I am not satisfied that this fact does justify a reduction in the costs in this case. It is evident from the issues raised in argument and the extent of information provided to me that this appeal put both parties to considerable cost. The errors in the Judge’s original decision were not serious errors, even though I considered they justified a re­assessment of the position. But overall, there is no basis for reducing the costs that would normally follow the outcome.  [3] There are to be costs on a 2B basis in favour of the respondent in accordance with Ms McCabe’s memorandum dated 24 March 2017.  P Courtney J

[2] Thequantityof drugs andthe purityof the drugs is an important consideration. There is just over fourkilograms of cocaine and it runs at apurityof some 86 percent.   [3] What that means to me is not so much in terms of dollars and cents as to what it can be sold for, but what it is going to do to the community.  [4] I agree with the prosecution that the starting point for someone who is at the low end of criminal culpability by being what we describe as a mule or a courier, for that quantity and purity of drugs sits around 12 years’ imprisonment.  R vEVELIN DE FATIMASTEMPOSKI[2017] NZDC 12765[15 June 2017]  [5] TheCourt has the benefit of previous cases by way of comparison and by way of setting what the appropriate sentencing limit is provided by both the prosecution and defence, and it is by applying those previous cases as precedent authorities that I get to a start point of 12 years imprisonment.  [6] Because you are going to be serving time in prison, you are at a disadvantage compared to local people in asimilarsituation. That disadvantage stems from the fact that your familyis stillinBrazil, your friends arethere, you do not speak thelanguage here and of course we have different moral standards that you will have to adjust to. So foryou toserveatermof imprisonment is morearduous than itmight befor others.  [7] Itakethose things into account togetherwith the fact that you havenoprevious convictions either here or overseas it seems.  [8] Because your guilty plea occurred at an early stage, Iam also able to give you a 25 percent discount from the starting point in relation to those.  [9] So, taking one year off because of no previous and because of difficulties that you will have serving your term of imprisonment, and then further reducing the start pointby25 percent and rounding itdown to the least number I can possiblyimpose, I end up with an end sentence of eight years’ imprisonment.  [10] I impose that on both charges concurrently; and the drugs are to be destroyed. No MPI is imposed.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  [201 SC 44/2017 7] NZSC 85   BETWEEN  MICHAEL JOHN DENNEY Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent    Court: Elias CJ, Glazebrook and Ellen France JJ Counsel: J F Pereira forApplicant A J Ewing for Respondent Judgment: 9 June 2017  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant was convicted after trial of intentionally causing grievous bodily harm by using his vehicle to run over the complainant, Mr Blain. The applicant appealed unsuccessfully against conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeal.1 He seeks leave to appeal to this Court against conviction.  [2] The background is as follows. After an argument with Mr Blain at a party, the applicant left in his car. Others at the party watched while Mr Blain chased after the applicant’s car on foot before disappearing out of sight. Mr Blain was found some minutes later lying on the road with serious injuries.  [3] Against this background, there are three proposed grounds of appeal. The first ground is a challenge to the reasonableness of the verdict. The second proposed  Denney v R [2017] NZCA80 (Winkelmann,Woodhouse and CollinsJJ) [Denney (CA)].  MICHAELJOHN DENNEYv R [2017] NZSC 85 [9 June 2017]  ground concerns the directions of the trial Judge, Judge Bergseng, in relation to evidence of a statement made by the applicant to the arresting officer which the Court of Appeal found was admissible under s 30 of the Evidence Act 2006.2 The final ground also concerns the Judge’s directions to the jury, in particular, as to expert evidence relating to tyre track measurements at the scene.  [4] None of the three proposed grounds of appeal raise questions of general or public importance. Rather, all three grounds are specific to the particular circumstances of this case.  [5] Nor is there a risk of a miscarriage of justice. In relation to the first proposed ground, the Court of Appeal was satisfied looking at all of the evidence that the jury’s verdict was reasonable. There is no appearance of miscarriage arising from that assessment. In terms of the other two proposed grounds, the Court of Appeal considered the directions given were sufficient. There is nothing in the material before this Court to call in doubt that conclusion.  [6] The criteria for leave are accordingly not met. The application for leave is dismissed.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent.  Judge Bouchier in R v Denney [2015] NZDC 8062 at [74] ruled the evidence was not improperly obtained. The Court of Appeal held that ruling was incorrect but that the evidence was nonetheless admissible under s 30(2)(b) of the Evidence Act 2006: Denney (CA), above n 1,  at [23]–[37].

IN THE SUPREME COURT OFNEWZEALAND  SC UR 2/2017  [2017] NZSC 84   BETWEEN  ANGELA JANICE HARRISON Applicant   AND  GRAEME ROSS HARRISONAND ADRIENNE HARRISON Respondents    Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment: 8 June 2017  JUDGMENTOFGLAZEBROOK J  The application for review of the Registrar’s decision declining to waive the payment of filing fee is dismissed.   REASONS  [1] Ms Harrison has filed an application for leave to appeal against the decision of French J of 21 March 2017, declining her application for review of the decision of the Registrar of the Court of Appeal refusing to dispense with security for costs.1 She also applies for leave to appeal directly to this Court against the decision of Associate Judge Osborne of 29 November 2016 adjudicating her bankrupt.2  [2] Ms Harrison made an application to the Registrar for a fee waiver on the basis that the proposed appeals would determine a question of law that is of significant interest to the public or to a substantial section of the public.  1 Harrison v Harrison [2017] NZCA67.  2 Harrison v Harrison [2016] NZHC 2854. The underlying appeal in n 1  is  an appeal against this decision.  ANGELAJANICE HARRISON v GRAEME ROSS HARRISONAND ADRIENNE HARRISON [2017] NZSC 84 [8 June2017]  [3] On 4 May 2017 the Registrar declined to waive the filing fee. With regard to  the proposed appeal against French J’s decision he said:  The application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court relates firstly to whether the Court of Appeal (21 March 2017 judgment) was correct in upholding the Registrar’s decision to refuse to dispense with security for costs fixed for the appeal against the judgment of Associate Judge Osborne.  The Court of Appeal adopts a straightforward review of the Registrar’s decision that engages no question of law that is of significant interest to the public or to a substantial section of the public to be considered by the Supreme Court in the application for leave. As such I am not satisfied that the appeal from the Court of Appeal concerns a matter of genuine public interest in terms of R5(2)(b)(i) [of the Supreme Court Fees Regulations 2003].  [4] With regard to the proposed appeal against Associate Judge Osborne’s  decision he said:  The second part of the application for leave to the Supreme Court relates to the ‘leap frog’ appeal from the decision of the High Court (29 November 2016 judgment). In my view the Judge adopts an orthodox approach to determining the issues before him (based very much on the specific facts of the case) and consequently again no question of law that is of significant interest to the public or to a substantial section of the public will need to be determined by the Supreme Court on appeal. Again I am not satisfied that the appeal from the High Court concerns a matter of genuine public interest in terms of R5(2)(b)(i) [of the Supreme Court Fees Regulations 2003].  I also note that French J at para [15] of the 21 March 2017 judgment expresses the same view in respect of the appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal.  [5] The matters Ms Harrison seeks to raise relate to her own particular  circumstances. I agree with the Registrar’s assessment that they do not meet the  threshold for a fee waiver under R5(2)(b)(i) of the Supreme Court Fees Regulations  2003.  [6] The application for review is dismissed.

REASONS  [1] Mr Rowell faces trial on two charges of indecent assault of a child and one of rape. The Court of Appeal dismissed Mr Rowell’s appeal against the admission at  GRAHAMTHOMAS ROWELLvR [2017] NZSC 82 [7 June 2017]  trial of propensity evidence, comprising previous convictions in 1979 and 19921 for sexual offending against three younggirls.2  [2] Mr Rowell seeks leave to appeal against the decision relating to the 1979 offending on the basis that it is of very limited probative value.3 He also submits that the 1979 offending would need to be contextualised by reference to his psychiatric condition at the time. This would necessitate reference to further offending in 1976 which has been ruled inadmissible. Further, the psychiatric reports prepared in the context of the 1979 offending are no longer available.  [3] We agree with the Crown’s submission that Mr Rowell has not met the criteria for a pre-trial appeal.4 Mr Rowell may raise the issue in any later appeal should he be convicted.  [4] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  [5] For fair trial reasons, an order is made prohibiting the publication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in the news media or on the internet or other publicly available database until the final disposition of trial. Publication in law report or law digest is permitted.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CIV-2016-404-001631 [2017] NZHC 1146  BETWEEN MOHAMMEDTASLIM FAZLY Plaintiff  AND  MINISTER OF IMMIGRATION   Defendant   Hearing:  On the papers   Counsel:  M S S Khan forApplicant   M J R Conway for Respondent   Judgment:  30 May 2017    JUDGMENT No 2 OF PALMER J (COSTS)  This judgment is delivered by me on 30 May 2017 at 12.30 pm pursuant to r 11.5 of the High Court Rules.  ..................................................... Registrar / Deputy Registrar  Solicitors/Counsel:  Singhs Solicitors,Auckland Crown Law,Wellington  FAZLYvMINISTER OF IMMIGRATION[2017] NZHC 1146 [30 May2017]  [1] On 7 February 2017 I issued judgment in Fazly v Minister of Immigration.1 I awarded costs to the Crown on a 1B basis.2  [2] Ms Conway, for the Crown, submits costs should be awarded on a 2B basis, which is what the parties had previously categorised it as, by joint memorandum. The Crown also seeks disbursements.  [3] Mr Singh, for Mr Fazly, submits the Crown should have appealed the judgment if it was not satisfied with the costs award. It did not. I note, though, that Mr Fazly effectivelydid, unsuccessfully.3 TheCourt ofAppeal awarded costs on the equivalent of a 2A basis with disbursements.4 The Court of Appeal has no equivalent to category 1.  [4] For the purposes of costs in the High Court, category 1 proceedings are “of a straightforward nature able to be conducted by counsel considered junior in the High Court”. Category 2 proceedings are “of average complexity requiring counsel of skill and experience considered average in the High Court”.  [5] Even if I have jurisdiction to revisit the judgment I would not change my assessment of these proceedings as being of a straightforward nature. I confirm the award of costs on a 1B basis. But I do direct the payment of the usual disbursements sought by the Crown, amounting to $1,278.76.  ..................................................................

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA430/2016 [2017] NZCA 209  BETWEEN  AFFCO NEW ZEALAND LIMITED Applicant   AND  EMPLOYMENT COURT First Respondent   NEW ZEALAND MEATWORKERS AND RELATEDTRADES UNION INCORPORATED Second Respondent   Court:  Randerson, French and Asher JJ   Counsel:  P R Jagose and G P Malone forApplicant K G Stone and V McCall for First Respondent PCranney and S R Mitchell for Second Respondent   Judgment:  24 May 2017 at 4.00 pm    (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The costs payable under the order made on 12 April 2017 are to be calculated in accordance with the daily recovery rate for a standard appeal and the time allocations for an application for leave to appeal contained in the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by French J)  AFFCO NEWZEALAND LIMITED vEMPLOYMENTCOURT[2017] NZCA209 [24May2017]  [1] In a judgment delivered on 12 April 2017, we dismissed AFFCO New Zealand Ltd’s application for judicial review and ordered the company pay the second respondent costs “as for a standard application on a bandAbasis and usual disbursements.”1  [2] The parties disagree on the amount of costs payable in terms of that order and have referred the matter back to the Court for resolution. In particular, they disagree whether the calculation should be determined by reference to scale costs on an appeal, or scale costs for an application.  [3] The difficulty has arisen because under r 53D of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005 scale costs are calculated in accordance with the time allocations in sch 2 and sch 2 only mentions appeals and applications for leave to appeal. Further, r 53C  — which regulates the daily recoveryrate — onlyrefers to appeals.  [4] However, the established practice is that the appropriate daily recovery rate for a “standard application” is the same as for a standard appeal. As regards the time allocation, costs “as for a standard application on a band A basis” are calculated by analogy on the same basis as applications for leave under sch2.  Our order was made in accordance with that established practice.  [5] Thecostspayable under the order madeon 12 April2017 are to becalculated in accordance with the daily recovery rate for a standard appeal and the time allocations for an application for leave to appeal contained in the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 50/2017 [2017] NZSC 77   BETWEEN  MANU PETER PESE Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent    Court: Elias CJ, William Youngand Ellen France JJ Counsel: O WoodroffeforApplicant A J Ewing for Respondent Judgment: 24 May 2017  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B Order prohibiting publication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in news media or on the internet or other publicly available database until final disposition of trial. Publication in law report or law digest permitted.  REASONS  [1] The applicant challenges a judgment of the Court of Appeal1 refusing him  leave to appeal against a District Court judgment2 which dismissed his application to  1 Pese v R [2017] NZCA106 (Cooper,Woodhouse and Collins JJ). 2 R v Pese [2016] NZDC 26205(Judge Moala).  MANU PETER PESE vR [2017] NZSC 77[24 May2017]  exclude from his forthcoming trial evidence of a DVD interview he had with police.  [2] The applicant is charged with indecent assault of a girl under 16 years of age. In his interview with police he initially denied assaulting the complainant but, when shown a video recording from the complainant’s cellphone, he acknowledged kissing her leg.   [3] The applicant’s argument that the evidence was unfairly obtained essentially failed on the facts in the District Court. The Court of Appeal in declining leave to appeal saw no reason to reconsider those factual findings. The Court also declined leave to adduce new evidence from a linguistic expert as to the applicant’s command of English.3 That was because the Court was not satisfied the District Court Judge could have reached a different opinion if the proposed evidence was before that Court.4  [4] Under s 213(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, the judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing the application for leave to appeal is “final”, which precludes an appeal to this Court from that decision.5 Nor would we be prepared to grant leave for a leap-frog appeal (that is, an appeal directly from the District Court judgment) given the non-satisfaction of the criteria for a leap-frog appeal.  [5] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed. For fair trial reasons we make an order prohibiting publication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in news media or on the internet or other publicly available database until final disposition of trial.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  NAPIER REGISTRY   CIV-2016-441-101   [2017] NZHC 1093   BETWEEN  THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION   First Plaintiff   THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION   Second Plaintiff   THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF   PARKVALE PRIMARY SCHOOL   Third Plaintiff   AND  TANIA MAY MCCARTNEY   First Defendant   CRAIG ROBERT MCCARTNEY   Second Defendant   On the papers:    Counsel: S-J Telford for Plaintiffs J McDowell for Defendants  Judgment: 24 May 2017  JUDGMENT OF WILLIAMS J (COSTS)  [1] The plaintiffs seek costs on a 2B basis of $5,686.50 plus $110 disbursements against the second defendant, Mr McCartney. Mr McCartney does not dispute the quantum. However, he seeks that the Court either refuses costs pursuant tor 14.7(g) or defers costs pursuant tor 14.8(1). This is on the basis that, like Parkvale School, he too is the victim of his ex-wife's dishonesty and is left with the burden of having to fund debts she incurred, while also caring for their two children.  [2] The Court has discretion under r 14.7(g) to refuse to award costs or reduce the costs otherwise payable if "some other reason exists which justifies the court refusing costs or reducing costs". I have not been referred to any case where this  THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION & ORS v MCCARTNEY & ANOR [2017] NZHC 1093 [24 May 2017]  rule has been relied on in a situation similar to Mr McCartney's, but I think it premature to discount that possibility at this interlocutory stage.  [3] Rule 14.8 provides that "costs on an opposed interlocutory application, unless there are special reasons to the contrary" must be fixed when the application is determined, and become payable when fixed. In my view, there are special reasons justifying delay. Mr McCartney is, as I have said, also a victim in this situation.  I consider that the best time to assess the relevance of that fact to the issue of costs will be after the substantive hearing and the decision on the merits.  [4] Costs are reserved accordingly.

(b)  If the first question is answered in the affirmative, should the High Court have remitted the case back to the Environment Court for reconsideration?     B Costs on the application are reserved.  R J DAVIDSON FAMILY TRUST v MARLBOROUGH DISTRICT COUNCIL [2017] NZCA 194 [19 May 2017]  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Asher J)  [1] We grant leave on the primary and subsidiary questions:  (a)  Did the High Court err in holding that the Environment Court was not able or required to consider pt 2 of the Resource Management Act 1991 directly and was bound by its expression in the relevant planning documents?   (b)  If the first question is answered in the affirmative, should the High Court have remitted the case back to the Environment Court for reconsideration?    [2] In addition to seeking leave on the two questions where we have granted leave, the applicant also sought leave to appeal on the procedural question of whether the Environment Court should have put the parties on notice of its proposed approach to pt 2, so that they could reframe their submissions accordingly. It was argued that the High Court did not determine this issue.   [3] We decline leave to appeal in respect of this procedural question as it is not of general or public importance. The broad issues were fully canvassed in the Environment Court, and in the High Court there were detailed submissions given on all matters relied on in the Environment Court decision. Therefore, on an overview, there has been no procedural unfairness. Moreover, as counsel for the applicant accepted, leave being granted in respect of the primary questions above means that the applicant will have another opportunity to put forward all submissions on pt 2 that it considers to be relevant.

[2] The application is suppo1ied by an affidavit of one of the Committee Members, Ms Loveridge, which provides important information in support of the application.  [3] The Committee manages the Tariki hall (the hall) and has done so for many years. The Committee considers their founding document is the Trust Deed dated 17 April 1911. All the original trustees are deceased and no new trustees have been appointed. The certificate of title for the land on which the hall sits remains in the names ofthe original trustees.  FABISH [2017] NZHC 1045 [22 May 2017]   [4] The Committee carries out administrative business regarding the hall and regularly meets to discuss the use, servicing and financing of the hall. I note the Committee now finds itself in a difficult position, given the expenses required to maintain the hall exceed the income the Committee has managed to generate. The Committee has resolved that a sale of the hall would be in its best interests. It has also resolved to donate the sale proceeds to charity and then wind up the Committee (and presumably also the Trust).  [5] It is not possible to take any of these steps until the Trust has active trustees.  [6] This Court has the power to appoint new trustees when it is expedient to do so, even where there is no existing trustee. 1  [7] I am satisfied from the evidence that it is expedient to appoint new trustees to the Trust. I am also satisfied it is impracticable to do so without the assistance of the Court, having referred to the appointment provision of the Trust Deed and the absence of current trustees. In all the circumstances it is appropriate the new trustees are all of the members of the Committee, being those who have for a number of years managed the hall. In doing so they have effectively acted in accordance with the terms of the Trust.  [8] The trustees will need to consider the te1ms of the Trust and their powers before taking steps to dispose of the hall.  [9] For the reasons given, the application is granted. Accordingly, I order: Paul William Fabish, Denise May Loveridge, Thomas Rupert Loveridge, Andrew Kelvin McElroy, Dorothy Michelle Oakes, Tania Maree Simpson, Cindy Lee Baldwin and Kevin Ronald Bennett are appointed as trustees of the Tariki Hall Trust.

Appeals to the Court ofAppeal are restricted to questions of law.  [2] Mr Kennedy, for Mangatu, sought leave to adduce evidence in support of the application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. I heard counsel on that application by telephone this morning. I refused the application, and it is hereby dismissed. I shall give reasons for that decision when I give judgment on the substantive application for leave to appeal to the Court ofAppeal.

I make the following directions:  (a)  Counsel for Mangatu shall file and serve submissions in support of the application by 4pm on 23 May 2017.

REASONS  [1] Mr Marteley sought leave to appeal directly to this Court against his conviction for murder following the entry of a plea of guilty. The Court dismissed his application.1  [2] Sincethat decision was delivered, Mr Marteleyhas written to the Registrar of the Court raising various concerns about the Court’s decision. The Court has decided to treat this correspondence as an application to recall the Court’s judgment.  Marteley v R [2017] NZSC 31.  TODD AARONMARTELEYv R [2017] NZSC 72[16May2017]  [3] Mr Marteley has raised nothing new in this further material which would justify recalling the judgment.

PUBLICATION IN LAW REPORT OR LAW DIGEST PERMITTED.  IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 45/2017 [2017] NZSC 73   BETWEEN  ALAN CHRISTOPHER HALIDAY Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, William Young and Ellen France JJ   Counsel:  E J Forster forApplicant J C Pike QC for Respondent   Judgment:  16 May 2017    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant faces charges of supplying and possession for supply of methamphetamine, possession of cannabis for sale and possession of a pipe for the purpose of smoking cannabis. At a pre-trial hearing in the District Court he unsuccessfully challenged the admissibility of a police search of him which resulted in the police finding 19.6 grams of methamphetamine, 34 grams of cannabis and $7,190 in cash.1 His subsequent appeal to the Court ofAppeal was unsuccessful.2  1 R v Haliday [2016] NZDC 18193 (Judge Rea) [Haliday (DC)]. 2 Haliday v R [2017] NZCA108 (Miller, Mallon and Peters JJ) [Haliday (CA)].  ALAN CHRISTOPHER HALIDAYv R [2017] NZSC 73[16 May 2017]  [2] The search took place in a street in Napier at around 3 am. The purpose of the search as notified to the applicant was to search for stolen property. This did not provide a lawful basis for the search. However, the District Court Judge and a majority in the Court of Appeal held that the constable had reasonable grounds to suspect that the applicant was in possession of an offensive weapon which, if identified at the time and explained to the applicant, would have provided a lawful ground for the search.3 Both the District Court Judge and the Court of Appeal applied s 30 of the Evidence Act 2006 to conclude that the evidence of the search and what was located should not be excluded.4  [3] No question of general or public importance arises and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice As well and in any event, we are not satisfied that it is necessary for the Supreme Court to hear the appeal before the applicant’s trial has concluded. Accordingly the criterion for the grant of leave to appeal in relation to an interlocutory application is not satisfied.  [4] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a decision of Brown J in the Court of Appeal dismissing applications (a) for review of the decision of a Deputy Registrar declining to dispense with security for costs and (b) to extend time for the filing of the application for dispensation.1 The underlying appeal was against a minute of Williams J striking out the second respondents as parties to proceedings to  Rabson v Judicial Conduct Commissioner [2017] NZCA44 [Rabson (CA)].  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON v JUDICIALCONDUCTCOMMISSIONER [2017] NZSC 74[16May 2017]  judicially review a decision of the Judicial Conduct Commissioner.2 The substantive judicial review application has since been dismissed.3  [2] The background to the applications dismissed by Brown J is outlined in his judgment.4 He saw the underlyingappeal as not being reasonablyarguable.5 He was also satisfied that a reasonable and solvent litigant would not pursue the appeal.6 In dismissing the applications, he applied well-established principles.   [3] The proposed appeal does not raise any question of public or general importance and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice. The criteria for leave thus not being satisfied, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

NOTE: PUBLICATION OF NAME, ADDRESS, OCCUPATION OR IDENTIFYING PARTICULARS OF COMPLAINANT PROHIBITED BY S 203 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT 2011.  IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 27/2017 [2017] NZSC 75   BETWEEN  ALAN IVO GREER Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, William Young and Ellen France JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person K S Grau for Respondent    Judgment: 16 May 2017  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant was found guilty of a number of serious offences (including rape) and was sentenced to preventive detention with a minimum period of imprisonment of 10 years. His appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed and he now seeks leave to appeal.1 He represented himself at trial albeit that the trial Judge appointed counsel to assist.  [2] On appeal to the Court of Appeal the applicant’s primary complaint, as the Court understood it, was that he had been the victim of a conspiracy encompassing  Greer v R [2016]NZCA630 (Asher,Woodhouse and EllisJJ).  ALAN IVO GREER v R [2017] NZSC 75[16 May2017]  the police, the prosecutors and the courts to deny him justice.2 Faced with this, the Court appointed counsel to assist who identified two points which he considered to be worthy of argument.3 These were considered by the Court of Appeal and dismissed.4 Counsel was not able to identify a credible basis upon which the sentence could be challenged.5 The Court nonetheless reviewed the grounds upon which the sentence of preventive detention and minimum period of imprisonment had been imposed and, on the basis of this review, dismissed the appeal.6  [3] The grounds of appeal primarily identified by the applicant in his application for leave to appeal are variations on the conspiracy theme identified by the Court of Appeal. He also, however, complains about the participation of Wild J in directions hearings in respect of his appeal to the Court ofAppeal (and in particular in requiring him to file a particularised grounds of appeal)7 and what he says has been a pattern of non-disclosure and failure to provide him the facilities he required to present his case.  [4] Thecomplaints about Wild J and the directions hegavearemisconceived and beside the point. Theapplicant did notcomplywith the directions. It was in light of this that the Court appointed counsel to assist. The Court of Appeal provided the applicant a fair opportunity to present his case which he did not take up. It is clear from the Court of Appeal judgment that counsel appointed to assist addressed, as best he could, the merits of the applicant’s general complaints. Nothing that is of relevance to the present application came out of that exercise.  [5] The proposed appeal raises no point of general or public importance and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.  [6] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Courtney J)  [1] Followinga judge alone trial in the District Court MrGaunt was convicted on one charge of common assault (spitting).1 He was not permitted time to make a written application for a discharge without conviction.2 His oral application for a discharge without conviction was refused without reasons being given and without the District Court Judge considering the relevant statutory criteria. His appeal to the High Court was dismissed by Cull J.3  1 CrimesAct 1961,s196. 2 Contrarytor2.12(2)(p)ofthe Criminal Procedure Rules 2012. 3 Gaunt v New Zealand Police [2016] NZHC 2505.  GAUNTvNEWZEALAND POLICE [2017] NZCA178 [12 May2017]  [2] We allow Mr Gaunt’s application for leave to bring a second appeal. In accordance with s 340(3)(a) of the Criminal ProcedureAct 2011 we are not required to give reasons for doing so.  [3] The ground of appeal is whether a miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of theJudge failing to take account of the complainant’s provocative act in spitting at Mr Gaunt first in assessing the gravity of the offending, failing to take account of MrGaunt’s difficult personal circumstances in assessing the effect of conviction on his employment prospects, and the effect of these two factors on the proportionality assessment.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  AUCKLAND REGISTRY   CIV-2016-404-000034   [2017] NZHC 963   BETWEEN  AMARJIT SINGH   Plaintiff   AND  ASSOCIATE MINISTER OF   IMMIGRATION   Defendant   Judgment:  12 May 2017    JUDGMENT OF COURTNEY J  This judgment was delivered byJusticeCourtney on12May2017 at 12 noon pursuant to R 11.5 oftheHigh Court Rules  Registrar / DeputyRegistrar  Date……………………….  SINGH vASSOCIATE MINISTER OF IMMIGRATION[2017] NZHC 963 [12 May2017]  On 1 December 2016 I dismissed Mr Singh’s application for judicial review. The defendant seeks costs on that application together with costs on an earlier, unsuccessful, application to subpoena the defendant.1 The defendant has filed a memorandum detailing a claim for costs on a 2B basis that totals $26,760 together with disbursements of $270. Mr Singh has not responded and enquiries by the Registry with his solicitors indicates that they no longer have instructions. I am satisfied that the costs claim is properly calculated and appropriate. There are to be costs, as sought, of $26,760 plus disbursements of $270.  P Courtney J  Faire J, who determined the earlier application, had directed that costs on that application be determined followingthe outcome ofthe substantive proceeding.  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV 2017-485-178 [2017] NZHC 931  IN THE MATTER of the estate of WHETUMARAMA OTE HAAHI RATANA URUAMO  Hearing: On Papers Counsel: M J P Davidson for Applicant Judgment: 10 May2017  JUDGMENT OF SIMON FRANCE J  [1] This is an application under s 14 of the Wills Act 2007 for order that the document which is the subject of the application is the last will ofWhetumarama Ote Haahi Ratana Uruamo.  [2] The document is an unsigned will that was drafted on the deceased's instructions some six years before her death. At that time Mrs Uruamo, and her husband Arthur, visited a local law firm asking that wills be drafted. There were no prior wills.  [3] The wills were drafted and sent to the couple for approval and execution. Mr Uruamo deposes that neither of them realised the wills actually had to be signed, and believed that they were being provided with copies of valid wills. Mr Uruamo says they never read the lawyer's letter properly. Consistent with this, at the time of his wife's death his will also remained unsigned. Mr Uruamo deposes that over the years his wife repeatedly expressed satisfaction she had taken care of him in her will. A similar sentiment was expressed when Mrs Uruamo was in hospital prior to her death.  ESTATE OF URUAMO [2017] NZHC 931 [10 May 2017]  [4] The only issue here is the length of time that has elapsed since the wills were provided. Care is needed that the lengthy period does not reflect a change in heart rather than the inadvertence or a misunderstanding. In Re Gray (Dec 'd), a will that was unsigned for nine years was validated. 1 The circumstances were different, but it provides an example where a lengthy lapse of time has not prevented the validation of the document. In Re Cornelius (Dec 'd), the period was three years.2 That appears to have been a situation where the testator just never got around to signing the will. Again the unsigned will was validated.  [5] The ultimate inquiry is whether the Court is satisfied the document proffered expresses, at the time of the person's death, their existing testamentary intentions. I am satisfied that is the case here. The document is a draft will that expressed the intentions of the Testator at the time it was drafted. There is nothing to suggest those intentions ever changed, nor is there evidence of any relevant change in circumstance that might have prompted Mrs Uruamo to take a different view. The couple have three children who have all consented to the application.  [6] I declare that the undated and unsigned draft will prepared for Mrs Uruamo in December 2010, and appended to the present application, is the valid will of Mrs Whetumarama Ote Haahi Ratana Uruamo.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 4/2017 [2017] NZSC 66   BETWEEN  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON Applicant   AND  JUDICIAL CONDUCT COMMISSIONER Respondent   Court:  Arnold, O'Regan and Ellen France JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person LTheron and C PA Cross for Respondent   Judgment:  9 May 2017    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] Mr Rabson asks the Court to recall its judgment declining him leave to appeal directly against a decision of Dobson J.1 He submits that Arnold and O’Regan JJ had conflicts of interest which precluded them from dealing with his application and that leave should have been granted because the appeal was a strong one.  [2] The recall application is misconceived. Mr Rabson has issued proceedings against the members of this Court and has made numerous complaints to the Judicial Conduct Commissioner about the way they have dealt with applications which he has made. The members of the Court against whom these actions have been taken have no alternative but to address his applications. Moreover, as the Court said in its earlier decision, Mr Rabson’s submissions about the alleged strength of his appeal  Rabson v Judicial Conduct Commissioner [2017] NZSC39.  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON v JUDICIALCONDUCTCOMMISSIONER [2017] NZSC 66[9 May2017]  are not directed to the “exceptional circumstances” test which must be met before leave can be granted for a leapfrog appeal.  [3] The application for recall is dismissed.  The Registrar is directed not to accept anyfurther applications for recall in relation to this matter from Mr Rabson.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY  UNDER BETWEEN  AND  On the papers  Judgment: 5 May2017   CIV 2015-485-729 [2017] NZHC 897   the Defamation Act 1992  SIR EDWARD TAIHAKUREI DURIE First Plaintiff  DONNA MARIE TAI KOKERAU HALL Second Plaintiff  HETA GARDINER First Defendant   THE MAORI TELEVISION SERVICE Second Defendant   JUDGMENT OF MALLON J (COSTS)  [l] I refer to paragraph [147] of my judgment delivered on 8 March 2017. 1 I have since received memoranda on the issue of costs. Having considered the memoranda I accept the defendant's submissions that costs should be ordered in their favour for the reasons on which they rely.  [2] In particular the starting position is that costs must be fixed when an interlocutory application is determined unless there are special reasons to the contrary.2 The novelty of the legal point on which the strike out application was  Durie v Gardiner [2017] NZHC 377. High Court Rules 2016, r 14.8(1).  DURIE v GARDINER [2017] NZHC 897 [5 May ~01,7]  based is not in itself a special reason not to fix costs.3 The fact that the defence will be tested at trial is accounted for in the rules.4  [3] The general principle is that the party who fails with respect to an interlocutory application should pay costs to the paiiy who succeeded.5 The defendants were the successful party. Neither defence, the subject of the application, was struck out. The defendants were required to re-plead the defence, but the plaintiffs failed on the more fundamental issues of whether the defamatory meanings were capable of being understood as expressions of opinion and whether there was any prospect of the defendants establishing reasonable grounds for believing the opinions were genuine. Therefore, although the plaintiffs had a measure of success in that the defendants were required to re-plead this defence, I am not satisfied that the pleading problems significantly increased the costs ofthe plaintiffs.6  [4] The defendants seek costs on a 2B basis and disbursements as calculated in their schedule (total $20,381.54). The plaintiffs have not challenged the items claimed or their calculation if costs are to be ordered. I make an order for the costs ( and disbursements as claimed.  ;l)~l  / Mallon J  Couch v Attorney-General [2010] NZSC 27, [2010] 3 NZLR 149 at [180] and Shell Todd Oil  Services Ltd v Nazzer HC New Plymouth CN-2005-443-268, 31 October 2005 at [17]. 4 High Court Rules 2016, r 14.8(2). 5 Rule 14.2. 6 Rule 14.7(d).

REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks a recall of the judgment of this Court delivered on 5April 2017 refusing him leave to appeal against a judgment of the Court of Appeal.1  Rabson v Gallagher [2017] NZSC 44.  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON v LINDAGALLAGHER [2017] NZSC 63[4 May2017]  [2] The bases upon which recall is sought consist of (a) a complaint that in the judgment under challenge, the Court of Appeal’s “refusal to clarify” its orders was unreasoned; (b) the picking up of a remark made in the leave judgment of this Court that there had been no explicit explanation of the reasons for the structure of the original orders; and (c) that it is “an affront to natural justice” for this Court to decline leave for an appeal which would clarify those orders.  [3] The Court of Appeal did, in fact, express its view as to the scope of the reservation of leave. The leave judgment provided what this Court regarded as a plausible explanation for the structure of the original orders. And, as the judgment makes clear, the Court was satisfied that the applicant could not credibly maintain that he had suffered a miscarriage of justice; this irrespective of the approach taken to the extent of the reservation of leave.  [4] The recall application is accordingly declined.  Solicitors: MaryJeffcoat,Wellington for First Respondent Buddle Finlay,WellingtonforThird Respondent

REASONS  [1] On 16 December 2015 the applicant filed an application for leave to appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal declining to continue name suppression.1 Ongoing name suppression was sought pending the hearing of an appeal against a decision of Moore J declining an application for judicial review in relation to name suppression.2  [2] The applicant indicated to the registry on 10 March 2016 that the application for leave to appeal would be abandoned. No notice of abandonment has been filed. Nor have any steps been taken to progress the application in a timely manner. The Registrar has been in contact with the applicant to attempt to progress the matter without success. Finally, on 11 April 2017, formal notice was given under s 338(2)  1 Young v The District Court at Hamilton [2015] NZCA584 (Randerson, French and Kós JJ). 2 Young v District Court [2015]NZHC 2677.

AN (SC 24/2017) v BUPACARE SERVICES (NEWZEALAND) LIMITED [2017] NZSC 52[1 May2017]  It is inappropriate to engage with such arguments in the absence of anything to suggest a basis for recall beyond the applicant’s disagreement with the result.   [3] Nothing raised by the applicant meets the threshold for a direct appeal from the High Court to this Court. Nor, for the reasons given in the earlier judgment, are the criteria for leave in s 74 of the Senior Courts Act 2016 met. The application for recall of the earlier judgment is accordingly dismissed.

    IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  TAURANGA REGISTRY    CIV-2016-470-204  [2017] NZHC 837       UNDER     s 21 of the Administration Act 1969      IN THE MATTER     of the Estate of Robert Reginald Haine      AND    IN THE MATTER         of the Estate of Eileen Minna Haine           JOHN DOUGLAS PATTERSON  Applicant                  Hearing:     (On the papers)      Counsel:     T J Conder for Applicant      Judgment:     28 April 2017         JUDGMENT OF BREWER J                                                Solicitors:   Holland Beckett (Tauranga) for Applicant  [1] The applicant has applied for leave to commence proceedings by way of originating application.  The proposed application is by Mr John Douglas Patterson for an order removing him as executor and administrator of the estate of Eileen Minna Haine.   [2] The reason for the application is that there is litigation between the estate of Eileen Minna Haine and the estate of Mrs Haine’s late husband, Robert Reginald Haine.  Mr Patterson is the sole executor in the estate of Mr Haine and he is a co-trustee in the estate of Mrs Haine.  There is a conflict of interest.     [3] There have been delays in progressing this uncontested matter because of a need to serve all relevant beneficiaries.  Associate Judge Christiansen dealt with this aspect in his Minute of 14 February 2017 in which his Honour made orders as to service.  Associate Judge Christiansen also ordered that those beneficiaries served pursuant to his directions must file any opposition within 15 working days.   [4] I have an affidavit from Tereasa Amanda Emily Peterson, sworn 23 March 2017, deposing to service on Ms L Cheetham and Ms P Haine.  In each case service was effected on 14 February 2017.   [5] In a memorandum, also dated 23 March 2017, Mr Conder for the applicant advises that these were the last beneficiaries who needed to be served.  He says that no notices of opposition have been filed and he seeks orders on the papers.     [6] In reliance upon Mr Conder’s memorandum, I make the following orders:   (a) The applicant is granted leave to commence his proceeding by way of originating application.   (b) The application is granted.  John Douglas Patterson is removed as executor of the estate of Eileen Minna Haine.    [7] I make no order for costs.        ________________________________  Brewer J  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CIV-2016-404-1693 [2017] NZHC 823  IN THE MATTER of an appeal against a decision of the Family Court at Auckland  BETWEEN KEVIN JOHN MARGINSON Appellant  AND MADHU BHANA Respondent  Hearing: On the Papers  Counsel: J G Donovan and M H Donovan for Appellant P J Wright for Respondent  Judgment: 28 April 2017  COSTS JUDGMENT OF FOGARTY J  This judgment was delivered by Justice Fogarty on 28 April 2017 at 2.30 p.m., pursuant to r 11.5 of the High Court Rules  Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date:  Solicitors: J G Donovan, Auckland Stainton Chellew, Auckland  MARGINSON v BHANA [2017] NZHC 823 [28 April 2017]  [1] By judgment delivered on 25 November last1 I dismissed an appeal against a decision of the Family Court ordering interim maintenance to the de facto wife.  [2] The last paragraph of the judgment, paragraph [24] of the judgment reads:  The respondent is entitled to costs, to be calculated on a 2B basis. If the parties cannot agree costs, I will receive submissions limited to five pages, exchanged in advance.  [3] That was a finding, and remains a finding, that the respondent is entitled to costs to be calculated on a 2B basis. The Court has received submissions where both parties are under the misapprehension that they were entitled to argue whether or not the respondent is entitled to costs and if so, on what basis.  [4] The respondent has calculated costs on a category 2B basis totalling 6.3 days at $2,230 per day, the sum of $14,049. Counsel for the unsuccessful appellant has calculated costs on a category 2 basis, but with a mixture of category A and category B arriving at 5.2 days.   [5] My judgment was for all attendances on a category 2B basis. I have compared the identification of steps. I agree that the respondent should not get costs on sealing an order.  So I recalculate costs at 6.1 x $2,230=$13,603.  [6] Accordingly, the costs awarded are as calculated by the respondent’s counsel in the sum of $13,603.   [7] This judgment has been delayed because of the submissions received from the parties having been mislaid in the Registry. Nonetheless, the award for costs carries interest under the Judicature Act from the date of this judgment.  Marginson v Bhana [2016] NZHC 2835.

[2] After initially perusing the Memorandum of Counsel and the Affidavit of his wife, Mrs Askew, I issued a minute1 requiring the health practitioner's medical certificate, as I had reservations about the reasons for the removal. The health practitioner's notes on the form simply stated:  "interviewing patient and wife.  Review of his medical records."  [3] There was no identification of the cause of Mr Askew's mental incapacity, as alleged by his wife and without further information regarding his mental health or  Minute of Cull J, 14 March 2017.  IN RE ASKEW [2017] NZHC 747 [13 April 2017]  medical diagnosis, I was not satisfied that there was a medical reason justifying the order sought.  [4] Since issuing my minute, I have now received a medical certificate, in which the doctor certifies that Mr Askew had been diagnosed by a geriatrician as having severe dementia, most likely of the Alzheimers type.  [5] I am now satisfied that the order seeking removal of Mr Askew as a Trustee of the Askew Family Trust can now be made and I so order.  
EDITORIAL NOTE: NAMES AND/OR DETAILS IN THIS JUDGMENT HAVE BEEN ANONYMISED.  IN THE DISTRICT COURT AT NAPIER CRI-2016-041-001401 [2017] NZDC 7951  NEW ZEALAND POLICE  Prosecutor  v   [OSCAR HAMMOND]  Defendant  Hearing: 13 April 2017  Appearances: Sergeant J Ashfield for the Prosecutor J Rainger for the Defendant  Judgment: 13 April 2017  NOTES OF JUDGE A J ADEANE ON SENTENCING  [1] Mr [Hammond] appears for sentence today on charges of assault with intent to injure, thereafter being a male assaulting a female while he was on bail for the first mentioned charge, breaching an earlier sentence of intensive supervision which was designed to address his domestic violence propensities, and a charge of breach of bail.  [2] At 27 years of age Mr [Hammond] already has four previous convictions for violent behaviour toward the same complainant. They are in a relationship, there are [number deleted] children who have all been taken into care and it appears that the underlying cause of the violence is Mr [Hammond]’s synthetic cannabis addiction.  [3] In total he has been involved in 41 domestic violence occurrences, obviously many of them not resulting in proceedings, but 16 of those have been in the last 12  NEW ZEALAND POLICE v [OSCAR HAMMOND] [2017] NZDC 7951 [13 April 2017]  months so there is an escalation in his offending and pressure may well be building toward a point where there is a very serious outcome.  [4] This is reflected in the summary of facts for both these charges. The summary in relation to the first matter, the assault with intent to injure containing a number of particularly ugly components, it was a prolonged and calculated attack on  the complainant and alone it calls for a starting point of 18 months’ imprisonment.  [5] The second matter was not in that category, but would require an uplift of six  months’imprisonment and the previous history to which I have referred an uplift of three months’imprisonment. The end result will be a starting point of two years and three months’ imprisonment from which some discount is appropriate, for the eventual guilty pleas, although they were not the earliest guilty pleas. Mr [Hammond]’s perception of matters may well have been affected by his drug addiction until such time as the beneficial effects of a remand in custody began to work through. I would reduce the sentence by three months, and accordingly on the assault with intent to injure impose a sentence of two years’ imprisonment and a concurrent of six months’ imprisonment for male assaults female, one month for breach of supervision, one month for breach of bail, all concurrent, an effective  sentence of two years’ imprisonment.

B  The extended supervision order made in the District Court at Christchurch   on 12 September 2008 is quashed.     REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Harrison J)  W(CA186/2017)V CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENTOF CORRECTIONS [2017] NZCA128[12 April 2017]  [1] On 23 March 2017 this Court allowed an appeal by the appellant, W, against his conviction in the District Court in Hamilton in December 2004 on five charges of sexual offending against a male complainant, L.1 All the convictions were quashed and the Court ordered that W was not to be retried.  [2] On 12 September 2008, on an application by the respondent in this appeal, the Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections, the District Court in Christchurch made an extended supervision order (ESO) against W. The order was made on the ground that W had been convicted of offending against L.  [3] As a consequence of this Court’s decision on 23 March 2017, the jurisdictional basis for the ESO has gone. W has now applied to this Court for: (1) leave to appeal out of time against the imposition of the ESO; and (2) an order for its revocation.  The Crown does not oppose.  [4] We are satisfied that leave should be granted and an order for revocation should be made as moved.  [5] Orders are made accordingly.

    IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  PALMERSTON NORTH REGISTRY    CRI-2017-454-000002  [2017] NZHC 737       BETWEEN     KERRYN MITCHELL  Appellant      AND     DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS  Respondent       Hearing:     11 April 2017      Counsel:     K M Mitchell in person C A Brook for Respondent      Judgment:     12 April 2017         JUDGMENT OF WILLIAMS J  [1] Ms Mitchell was originally sentenced on 2 December 2015 to two years’ and three months’ imprisonment.1  She appealed to the Court of Appeal, which on 1 July 2016 reduced her sentence to 19 months.2  She was released immediately.  As the sentence was now a short-term sentence, the sentencing court, rather than the Parole Board, became responsible for imposing release conditions.3  The Crown applied to the Court of Appeal to recall its judgment and impose release conditions.  The Court of Appeal declined to do so on 14 July, stating that the matter would be more appropriately dealt with in the District Court because a hearing was required and because this would better preserve appeal rights.4   [2] Corrections then applied to the District Court, and on 29 July, Judge Rowe imposed special release conditions.5  Ms Mitchell attempted to file an appeal against that decision in the Court of Appeal, but her application was rejected by the    1  R v Mitchell [2015] NZDC 23977.  2  Mitchell v R [2016] NZCA 299, [2016] NZFLR 487.  3  Sentencing Act 2002, s 93.  4  R v Mitchell [2016] NZCA 331.  5  The reasons decision was released on 10 August.  Department of Corrections v Mitchell [2016] NZDC 14908.  Registrar, apparently because she had already exercised her right of appeal to the Court of Appeal in the context, of the 1 July 2016 decision.  She then filed an appeal and an application for judicial review in this Court.  The judicial review has not yet been set down.  The appeal came before me yesterday.   [3] This case raises the issue of whether there is a right of appeal against the imposition of release conditions in short duration sentences.  In my recent decision in Patterson v R, I found that there is such a right.6  The Crown now says that case was wrongly decided, and Ms Mitchell has no right of appeal.  It is common ground that the issue is moot in this particular case either because as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court in Marino v Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections7, Judge Rowe did not have jurisdiction to impose conditions at all, or, if he had jurisdiction (the Crown suggests that Marino may only have prospective effect) the conditions have long since expired anyway.  Both parties in this case nonetheless want the question resolved, because, they say, it is in the public interest to have a clear answer.  In any event, whether that is enough to overcome the mootness issue is not for me.  That is because this Court is not the appropriate forum to address the issues raised by this appeal.  If there is jurisdiction it is the Court of Appeal, not the High Court that is the correct first appeal court.8  The Crown has indicated that it would not oppose an extension of time for filing an appeal in the Court of Appeal.   [4] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed due to lack of jurisdiction.  The appellant is invited to re-file in the Court of Appeal.    6  Patterson v R [2017] NZHC 49.  7  Marino v Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2016] NZSC 127, [2017] 1 NZLR 223.  8  Criminal Procedure Act s 247.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 6/2017 [2017] NZSC 46   BETWEEN  DAVID KEITH SILBY Applicant   AND  NEW ZEALAND POLICE Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, William Young and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person CABrook and S K Jameson for Respondent   Judgment:  7 April 2017    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant challenges a judgment of the Court of Appeal1 refusing him leave to appeal against a High Court judgment2 which dismissed his appeal against his convictions and the sentences imposed on charges of driving too close behind another vehicle and using a mobile phone while driving.3 He also, in the alternative, seeks leave to appeal directly from the High Court judgment.   [2] The police officer who witnessed the offending and stopped the applicant was a detective who was not in uniform. Basing himself on ss 113 and 114(1) of the Land Transport Act 1998, the applicant maintains that the detective had not been entitled to stop him. As the High Court and Court of Appeal judgments point out,  1 Silby v New Zealand Police [2016] NZCA592 (Cooper, Brewer and PetersJJ) [Silby (CA)]. 2 Silby v New Zealand Police [2016] NZHC 162 (VenningJ) [Silby (HC)]. 3 New Zealand Police v Silby [2016] NZDC 25869(Judge Becroft).  DAVID KEITH SILBYv NEWZEALANDPOLICE [2017] NZSC46 [7April2017]  this argument overlooks s 114(2) which authorised the course the detective took.4 There is thus no substance in his complaints.  [3] Under s 213(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, the judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing the application for leave to appeal is “final” which precludes an appeal to this Court from that decision. We are not prepared to grant leave for a leap-frog appeal (that is direct from the High Court judgment) given its lack of substance and the non-satisfaction of the criteria in s 14 of the Supreme Court Act 2003.5  [4] Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks a recall of this Court’s judgment dismissing his application forreviewof adecision ofArnold Jbyminute of19 December2016.1 In that minute, Arnold J dealt with an application by Mr Rabson for recall of this Court’s judgment in Erceg v Erceg.2 Arnold J ruled that the applicant had no standing to seek recall of the Erceg judgment. The Court dismissed the application for review for want of jurisdiction.  [2] The application for recall raises no matter that provides any basis for reconsideration of the judgment. The statement in the judgment that the Court does not have jurisdiction means what it says.  1 Re an application by Rabson [2017] NZSC 19. 2 Erceg v Erceg [2016] NZSC 135.  AN APPLICATION BYMALCOLM EDWARD RABSON[2017] NZSC 41 [5April 2017]  [3] The application for recall is therefore dismissed.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 19/2017 [2017] NZSC 45   BETWEEN  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON Applicant   AND  JUDICIAL CONDUCT COMMISSIONER Respondent   Court:  Arnold, O'Regan and Ellen France JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person LTheron and C PA Cross for Respondent   Judgment:  5 April 2017    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant must pay the respondent costs of $2,500.    REASONS  [1] The applicant, Mr Rabson, issued judicial review proceedings against the Judicial Conduct Commissioner in respect of the Commissioner’s rejection of various complaints made by Mr Rabson against members of this Court arising out of decisions made by the Court.1 Cull J struck the proceedings out, on the basis that they disclosed no reasonable cause of action and were an abuse of process.2  [2] Cull J held that the proceedings disclosed no reasonable cause of action because the Commissioner had rejected Mr Rabson’s complaints on the basis they challenged the legality or correctness of judicial decisions and were accordingly  1 Mr Rabson included the “Supreme Court of New Zealand” as second respondent in the proceedings, but Williams J struck the Court out as a party: see Rabson v Judicial Conduct Commissioner [2016]NZHC 884.  2 Rabson v Judicial Conduct Commissioner [2016] NZHC 2539, [2016]NZAR 1679.  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON v JUDICIALCONDUCTCOMMISSIONER [2017] NZSC 45[5April 2017]  outside the Commissioner’s jurisdiction.3 Given the nature of Mr Rabson’s complaints, Cull J considered that the Commissioner’s assessment in relation to jurisdiction was correct.4 As to abuse of process, Cull J held that the application for judicial review contained speculative and extreme allegations without any reasonable basis and were, in any event, a collateral attack on earlier decisions of this Court.5  [3] Mr Rabson filed an appeal against Cull J’s decision in the Court of Appeal, but that appeal was ultimately deemed to have been abandoned. Mr Rabson now seeks leave to appeal directly to this Court.   [4] The general point that Mr Rabson wishes to argue is that Cull J was wrong to strike out the proceedings because the Commissioner had not considered the merits of his complaints, so that it was not possible for Cull J to reach a view about them. In relation to the exceptional circumstances required to justify a “leap frog” appeal,6 Mr Rabson relies on his inability to pay security of costs in the Court of Appeal, as well as the importance of the matters he seeks to raise.  [5] Wedo not consider that Mr Rabson has raised anythingwhich would justifya conclusion that there are exceptional circumstances sufficient to justify a “leapfrog” appeal to this Court. Moreover, we are not satisfied that Mr Rabson has raised anything which suggests that there is a point of general or public importance in the proposed appeal or which casts doubt on the correctness of Cull J’s decision.  [6] Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed. The applicant must pay the respondent costs of $2,500.

EDITORIAL NOTE: CHANGES MADE TO THIS JUDGMENTAPPEAR IN [SQUARE BRACKETS].  IN THE DISTRICT COURT ATWAITAKERE  CRI-2016-090-004881 [2017] NZDC 22348   INLAND REVENUE DEPARTMENT  Prosecutor  v   ERENA EVELYN MURRAY  Defendant  Hearing: 4 April 2017  Appearances: B Chin for the Prosecutor T Greenwood for the Defendant  Judgment: 4 April 2017  NOTES OFJUDGE SATHORBURN ON SENTENCING  [1] Ms Murray is to be sentenced in respect to two charging documents charging her with offences against the Tax Administration Act 1994 pertaining to two periods of failure to pay PAYE; the deductions being made from the employees’ entitlement but not then being passed on to the IRD. In total over the period of time, the two charging documents being representative, there was some $68,000 not received. The period of time was approximately a year through 2015 and 2016, 18 months more accurately, and reflected, as I say, in two representative charges.   [2] Today, 4 April, shehas been remanded for sentence. IhaveaPAC report. Most importantlyandusefullyIhavehadsomeexcellent submissions from hercounsel and, of course, from the Department’s counsel as well which have been extremely useful.  INLAND REVENUE DEPARTMENT v ERENAEVELYN MURRAY[2017] NZDC 22348[4April 2017]  [3] At the end of the day, however, there is perhaps a unique factor, or one if not unique not often to be observed, and that is there has been complete repayment and that is a massive factor for consideration against offending which predictably would at this level attract a term of imprisonment.   [4] Two, there is nothing formally known by way of prior convictions and so to that extent this lady comes to the Court, Ms Murray, with good character, blemished now by obviouslythis Achilles heel that has taken its toll of her good character as we speak but up until now in her stage in life she has been living trouble-free.  [5] Theexplanations arealittle difficult to bepreciselyidentified but clearlythere must not be any continuation of failure of her obligation if she is in this role to pass on the monies collected from employees to the Inland Revenue Department and I mention that quite deliberatelybecause it is so important if she is in this role she gets her administration, her methods and her management absolutely smooth and, as we say, tickety-boo, because this cannot happen again.  [6] Saved by the steps that she has taken to repay in full from a term of imprisonment today then on these two matters I sentence her to six months’ community detention. The address is [address deleted]. Thecurfew at that address willstart this Fridayandthe curfew is aseven night per week nightlycurfew, 7.00 pm to 7.00 am.   [7] In sentencing in that way I have not, of course, gone on the detailed exercise of identifying an imprisonment starting point and bringing in discounts for plea et cetera. I have no issue with that in the circumstances. Clearly a term of imprisonment is to be expected for this type of offending. Clearly for this lady, and for the reasons obvious, she would not be sentenced to a term of two years or more and clearlytherefore alternative options such as the sentence Ihave imposed are open to her.  Sentenced accordingly, thank you.  SAThorburn District Court Judge  
IN THE HIGH COURT OFNEWZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CIV-2016-404-002598 [2017] NZHC 621  UNDER the PropertyLawAct 2007  INTHE MATTER of an application for an order for possession of land, cancellation of lease and ancillary orders  BETWEEN  LUONG THANG TIEUAND LE LAM TIEU Plaintiffs/Applicants   AND  GLENYS MUIR Defendant/Respondent   Hearing:  3 April 2017    Counsel: GJ Kohler QC for Plaintiffs/Applicants Judgment: 3 April 2017  ORALJUDGMENT OFDOWNS J  Solicitors/Counsel: BTLaw,Auckland. GJ Kohler QC,Auckland.  TIEU vMUIR [2017] NZHC 621[3April2017]  [1] The Tieus own a property at 3 Bracken Avenue, Epsom. The property is leased to Ms Muir. She has fallen considerably behind in the payment of rent. On 14 October 2016 the Tieus filed this proceeding—an application for orders for possession of the land, cancellation of the lease and related orders.  [2] Mr Kohler QC appeared in support of the applications today. There was no appearance for the respondent. The case has some history.  As I have observed, the proceeding was filed on 14 October 2016. There was an attempt at settlement, I assume on the basis Ms Muir would re-finance.  That has not occurred.  [3] Mr Kohler advises Ms Muir returned a key (for the property) to his clients at the weekend, presumably on the basis she would take no further step to resist the proceeding. No notice of opposition has been filed. When the proceeding was last called before Davison J, His Honour adjourned it on the basis that adjournment was to be the last.  And so it has proved to be.  I am satisfied theapplications are proper:   (a)  The lease(C460128.2F) is cancelled as of 11April 2017.    (b)  TheTieus are to have possession of thepropertyfrom the same date.    (c)  They are also entitled to rent in arrears. As at 28 February 2017, the outstanding amount was $266,930. The daily rate of rent is $315.06. I make an order the Tieus are entitled to outstanding rent of $266,930, plus the daily rate of $315.06 through to and including 11April 2017.    (d)  Unsurprisingly, the Tieus seek costs on a 2B basis.  That too is proper.  And, I make that order.    ……………………………..  Downs J

You came to New Zealand as a visitor with the intention of being the person who received an importation of methamphetamine, and you received 1.9 kilograms of methamphetamine in your role as a catcher.  You overstayed for the purpose of carrying out that role.   [2] Your offending falls within what is known as Band 4.  The Crown submitted that the appropriate starting point was between 15 and 16 years’ imprisonment.  Your counsel argued for a lower starting point of 12 years.  At the sentencing indication hearing I indicated I would take a starting point of 14 years.  I confirm that starting point and that is the starting point I take today.    [3] Since the sentencing indication I have received the pre-sentence report.  You told the probation officer that you decided to engage in this offending knowing the    risks as the pay off was worth it.  The report writer observed that you have displayed little remorse.   [4] Mr Kan has submitted today that you are remorseful, and says that a sentence of imprisonment will be a harsh one for you, given that you are in New Zealand where you have no family or other support at all.     [5] I confirm that you will be given a full 25 percent for your guilty plea which will reduce the sentence to one of 10 and a half years’ imprisonment.  But there will be no further discount.   [6] I indicated at the sentencing indication hearing that there would be no minimum period of imprisonment greater than that which applies under the Parole Act 2002.  I will not depart from that indication but I do record that I seriously question whether I was right to adopt that position.     [7] Those who come to New Zealand for the purpose of importing methamphetamine must expect lengthy terms of imprisonment.  Methamphetamine is an absolute scourge in our society.  I consider that the general public have no idea of the extent to which it is prevalent.  It wrecks lives, and there is little room for compassion or leniency for those who would distribute it.  So I consider that you are fortunate that there is no minimum period of imprisonment greater than that which applies by statute.     [8] Therefore the sentence is one of 10 years six months’ imprisonment.          R J Collins  District Court Judge  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 4/2017 [2017] NZSC 39   BETWEEN  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON Applicant   AND  JUDICIAL CONDUCT COMMISSIONER Respondent   Court:  Arnold, O'Regan and Ellen France JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person LTheron and C PA Cross for Respondent   Judgment:  27 March 2017    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant must pay the respondent costs of $2,500.    REASONS  [1] The applicant, Mr Rabson, complained to the respondent, the Judicial Conduct Commissioner, about certain conduct of Judges of this Court. The Commissioner dismissed the complaint, on the basis that it was outside his jurisdiction because it went to the legality or correctness of a judicial decision.1 MrRabson then issued judicial review proceedings seeking to challenge the Commissioner’s decision not to engage with the merits of his complaint. On the Commissioner’s application, Dobson J struck the proceedings out, on the grounds that they disclosed no tenable cause of action and were, in any event, an abuse of  2 process.  1 See Judicial Conduct CommissionerandJudicial Conduct Panel Act 2004,s8(2). 2 Rabson v Judicial Conduct Commissioner [2016] NZHC 3162 at [17] and [21].  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON v JUDICIALCONDUCTCOMMISSIONER [2017] NZSC 39[27March 2017]  [2] On 12 January 2017, Mr Rabson filed an application for leave to appeal against Dobson J’s decision directly to this Court. On the same day he also filed an appeal against Dobson J’s decision in the Court of Appeal. According to the Commissioner, Mr Rabson subsequently filed an application in the Court of Appeal to dispense with security for costs, which was declined by the Registrar. As far as we know, that is where matters rest in that Court.  [3] On an application for a direct appeal to this Court from the High Court, an applicant must meet the usual test for leave3 and establish as well that there are “exceptional circumstances” which justify a direct appeal.4 We are satisfied that neither test is met in this case.  [4] First, this proposed appeal raises no question of general or public importance.  Rather, it concerns the application of settled principles in relation to strike outs to the particular circumstances of this case. Mr Rabson has raised nothing which suggests that Dobson J may have erred in his application of the relevant principles or that there is arisk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.  [5] Second, no exceptional circumstances have been identified which justify a direct appeal to this Court. The matters raised by Mr Rabson on this point appear to go to the strength of his proposed appeal. But that is not a sufficient reason for a direct appeal.  [6] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed. The applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  CA63/2017 [2017] NZCA 76  BETWEEN  MARGOT EMILY CREQUER Appellant   AND  THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFTHE MINISTRY OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT Respondent   Counsel:  Appellant (in person)   Judgment:  24 March 2017 at 11.30 am    (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OFMILLER J (Review of Registrar’s Decision)  The application for review is dismissed.   REASONS  [1] This judgment responds to Ms Crequer’s application for review of a Registrar’s decision to refuse to waive a filing fee for an application for leave to bring a second appeal.  [2] The proposed appeal concerns the interpretation of s 71A of the Social Security Act 1964. The waiver application was based on the ground of genuine public interest in this question. The Deputy Registrar understood that Ms Crequer did not assert inability to pay.  [3] The Deputy Registrar considered that the application did not raise a question of law of significant interest to the public, but rather was peculiar to Ms Crequer and  CREQUER vTHE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE MINISTRYOF SOCIALDEVELOPMENT[2017] NZCA76 [24March 2017]  a small number of people who may be similarly affected by a reduction in an income-tested benefit where weekly compensation is also being received. I agree with the Deputy Registrar.  [4] On closer examination of her application Ms Crequer does say that she is unable to pay for litigation. However, she also indicates that if the waiver is not granted she will decide then whether or not to pay, and she says that if a waiver is refused it is most “likely” that she will not proceed. I am not satisfied that she is without means to pay the fee.  [5] The application for review is dismissed.  [6] The date set by the Deputy Registrar for payment of the filing fee has now passed.  I direct that the fee be paid by 6April 2017.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent

[2] In my judgment I directed that any submissions regarding costs should be filed within 21 days of the date of the judgment.   [3] I have now received submissions on behalf of Mr Simpson seeking either that both parties are reimbursed for their costs from the Trust fund or costs should lie where they fall.  No submissions have been filed by or on behalf of Ms Sax.   [4] In the circumstances, where there has been the opportunity to file submissions but Ms Sax has chosen not to do so, I will proceed to deal with the question of costs.   [5] I accept Mr Simpson’s submission that his application was required given the impasse between the trustees as to whether the District Court proceedings should be defended or not.     [6] I also concur with the submission that Mr Simpson’s application can be considered brought in good faith given my observation that there appeared to be a reasonably arguable case in respect of both positions.   [7] Mr Simpson was not, however, successful on his Beddoe application.  I take note of the matters put forward on Mr Simpson’s behalf alleging that Ms Sax’s conduct had contributed unnecessarily to the time the case has taken.  There is some merit in those observations.   [8] I accept this is a case where both parties have had a measure of success and in the circumstances it is appropriate that costs lie where they fall.

EDITORIAL NOTE: NO SUPPRESSION APPLIED.  IN THE DISTRICT COURT AT HUTT VALLEY CRI-2016-096-002998 [2017] NZDC 6335  NEW ZEALAND POLICE  Prosecutor  v   WIREMU HAMILTON WORKMAN  Defendant  Hearing: 24 March 2017  Appearances: R Georgiou for the Prosecutor P Paino for the Defendant  Judgment: 24 March 2017  NOTES OF JUDGE A I M TOMPKINS ON SENTENCING  [1] Wiremu Workman appears for sentence in relation to charges of offering to supply methamphetamine, unlawfully taking a motor vehicle, two charges of receiving identified motor vehicles, three charges of driving whilst disqualified, one charge of breach of bail; and guilty pleas having recently been entered, three firearms’ charges, one charge of possession of a methamphetamine pipe and one charge of possession methamphetamine simpliciter.   [2] Mr Paino earlier sought a sentence indication on behalf of Mr Workman and I gave such an indication which was subject to a pre-sentence report being obtained, a home detention sentence together with disqualification and reparation, with the home detention likely to be in the nine to 10 months’ range, together with counselling and treatment as set out in the psychological assessment the Court had earlier sought.  NEW ZEALAND POLICE v WIREMU HAMILTON WORKMAN [2017] NZDC 6335 [24 March 2017]  [3] That indication was accepted but has been overtaken by the new charges. It is now accepted that the sentence of imprisonment greater than that which would otherwise have allowed a community-based, electronically monitored sentence to result is inevitable.   [4] There was some discussion between counsel and me today as to how that should be calculated but in the end, given that Mr Workman will be appearing before the Parole Board in due course. To ensure no complications arise from the cumulative sentences being imposed in respect to different groups of sentence, Mr Workman is dealt with in this way:  (a) On the offering to supply methamphetamine, he is convicted and  sentenced to two and a half years’ imprisonment.  (b)  On each of the unlawful taking and receiving charges, and the three firearms’ charges, he is convicted and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment.   (c)  On each of the three charges of driving whilst disqualified, he is convicted and sentenced to three months’imprisonment, together with one year’s disqualification from 24 March 2017, that is today.   (d)  On the single charge of breach of bail, he is convicted and discharged.    [5] Having imposed those sentences as all to be served concurrently, as indicated Mr Workman will in due course appear before the Parole Board. It will be up to him to demonstrate at that time that he has taken advantage of any and all rehabilitative options made available to him during his sentence.  A I M Tompkins District Court Judge  
EDITORIAL NOTE: NO SUPPRESSION APPLIED.  IN THE DISTRICT COURT   AT HAMILTON   CRI-2015-019-004719   [2017] NZDC 5626   THE QUEEN   v   TRACEY LEE BELL   Hearing:  17 March 2017   Appearances:  D J McWilliam for the Crown   K Burroughs for the Defendant   Judgment:  17 March 2017    NOTES OF JUDGE D M WILSON QC ON SENTENCING  [1] Tracey Lee Bell, you appear for sentence having been found guilty by a jury on a charge of aggravated robbery. The circumstances of that robbery were that you and the co-accused deliberately planned it. You used a deceit to isolate the complainant and your intention was to rob her.  [2] You went to her motel room which was where she was working, but I agree  with the Crown’s submission that this was akin to a private dwelling because her  own personal items were there. You, over a series of texts, organised to go there. She thought you were a paying client.   [3] And when you got there, by your conduct, you attempted to check out whether any of your property was at the address and once Howarth arrived in possession of a weapon, you involved yourself by punching her to the head.  R v TRACEY LEE BELL [2017] NZDC 5626 [17 March 2017]  [4] The effect on her has been significant. Her vehicle was taken and her phone, although the vehicle has been returned. I accept the Crown’s submission that this was a joint enterprise between you and was marked by clear planning and preparation.  [5] In the sentencing of Mr Howarth, Judge Marshall identified an appropriate starting point of four years and nine months. The Crown here submits that you are equally culpable. A distinguishing point really is that you have no relevant previous convictions but that is not a factor which goes to starting point.  [6] The violence that you engaged in is perhaps at a lower level and the degree of your participation can be recognised relative to that of Howarth’s in setting a slightly lower or a lower starting point.  I set that as a term of four years.  [7] You have prior good character that you can call on and I give you a credit and there are also the circumstances of a jail term impacting more sternly on you as someone who has never been there before and currently you are being held in segregation for unknown reasons. I give you a credit of six months for those characteristics.  [8] The end sentence therefore, is one of three years and six months.  D M Wilson QC District Court Judge  
    IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY    CIV-2017-485-132  [2017] NZHC 403       IN THE MATTER     of section 14 of the Wills Act 2007      AND                IN THE MATTER     of the estate of IAN ROBERT JAMESON  Deceased       Hearing:     On Papers      Counsel:     S Heays for Applicant      Judgment:     13 March 2017         JUDGMENT OF SIMON FRANCE J    [1] This is an application to declare a document to be a valid will under s 14 of the Wills Act 2007.   [2] The testator had a friend prepare his will.  The friend and the testator were seemingly unaware of the requirement for two witnesses in the presence of each other.  The document contemplated one witness, and that is what occurred.   [3] The document begins:    This is the last will and testament of Ian Robert Jameson of ….  I hereby revoke all other wills and testaments.  The contents are orthodox leaving all his estate to his wife.  If she predeceases, then to his children in nominated shares.  [4] The witness has sworn an affidavit.  It was she who drafted the will on Mr Jameson’s instructions.  He confirmed to her it represented his wishes.  She saw him sign it and herself then immediately witnessed the will.    [5] The applicant is Mr Jameson’s surviving spouse.  Her only two children have both consented to the application.   [6] There is no doubt the document represents Mr Jameson’s intended will.  Although it is improperly witnessed, the circumstances show there was a witness present who saw him sign, and who is in a position to confirm it was her expressed intention.  There is nothing unusual about the contents that might cause one to hesitate, or inquire further.   [7] I declare the document dated “14 day of 9 2013”, and headed as described in para [3] above to the valid will of Mr Ian Robert Jameson.        _____________________________  Simon France J

EDITORIAL NOTE: NO SUPPRESSION APPLIED.  IN THE DISTRICT COURT   AT MANUKAU   CRI-2016-092-009035   [2017] NZDC 4925   THE QUEEN   v   PAPA WILLIAM   Hearing:  9 March 2017   Appearances:  N Dobbs for the Crown   L Hughes for the Defendant   Judgment:  9 March 2017    NOTES OF JUDGE G AANDRÉE WILTENS ON SENTENCING  [1] Mr William, you are for sentence in relation to two sets of offending, the first occurred in March last year and the second in August last year, I am told now by Ms Hughes that in fact the age that you were at those times is different to the age that I had appreciated when I gave you a sentence indication, that you were one year younger than I understood you to be. So the first offending involves possession of a small amount of cannabis and possession of a small amount of methamphetamine when you were 19 it seems and then later when you were 20 possession of some five grams of methamphetamine for supply, unlawful possession of a pistol without a good reason for having it which happened to be a modified .22 which was loaded with nine rounds and possession of a pipe for methamphetamine.  [2] The driving while forbidden I am not concerned about, I convict you and discharge you in relation to that but that second set of offending occurred while you were on bail awaiting sentence for the first set of offending.  R v PAPA WILLIAM [2017] NZDC 4925 [9 March 2017]  [3] The sentence indication that I gave you was that the appropriate start point for the second set of offending was two and a half years plus the earlier offending and I would take into account your youth, you have no previous convictions and your pleas and I would get down to something like 26 months taking into account everything. The change since then is firstly that I have been corrected as to your actual age at the time of the earlier offending which is not as significant as the second offending and a pre-sentence report which has been obtained.   [4] The pre-sentence report is not flattering, a description of you being smug and amused when relaying the circumstances of your offending and it records that you showed no remorse for your actions and as the sergeant says, to be driving around in a motor vehicle in the process of having possession of methamphetamine for the purposes of supply with a loaded modified weapon, a pistol, is a very serious matter.  [5] I am prepared to take into account the new material and new information that I have today but what that enables me to do is to reduce the starting point down to  24 months’ imprisonment.   [6] I then have to consider whether home detention is available for you and whether it is appropriate, it is obviously available because the law provides for an alternative to serving 24 months’ imprisonment by means of serving a sentence of home detention. The issue is does that satisfactorily deal with holding you accountable for your conduct and to deter you and others from acting in this way in the future? I am not satisfied it does, so even though you are in the range for a sentence of home detention I accept the recommendation in the pre-sentence report and sentence you to an actual term of imprisonment of 24 months, I impose that on the possession of methamphetamine for supply.  [7] The driving while forbidden, as I say, is convicted and discharged.  [8] On all the other charges, three months’ imprisonment concurrently.  G A Andrée Wiltens District Court Judge

I am not going to repeat all of that.  [2] The new material that I have before me since then is a memorandum by your counsel Ms Maxwell which repeats the indication that I gave. It indicates that you are remorseful and that you have some insight now into your offending and some intent to change your ways. Ms Maxwell on your behalf, and Ms Cherrington this morning repeats that, seeks a small further reduction from the starting point indicated. I regret that that is not possible.  [3] I gave you a discount of 25 percent for your pleas which were not at the earliest possible stage, they were still relatively early but 25 percent is for the maximum available. Not only that, I am going to cancel the sentence of community  R v CHRISTINA NGATOKOROA GLASSIE [2017] NZDC 4920 [9 March 2017]  work and remit the outstanding fines of $3850.68. That seems to me to take into account your letter of remorse that you have now written at a very late stage in the proceedings, and your stated intentions to change your way of life.   [4] The end sentence needs to remain at the level of three years six months’ imprisonment. I impose that for the robbery and the aggravated robbery charges.   For all the other charges three months’ imprisonment, all sentences to run  concurrently.  [5] Once you have served your sentence the Parole Board will look at appropriate release conditions.

B Order prohibiting publication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in news media or on the internet or other publically available database until final disposition of trial. Publication in law report or law digest permitted.  REASONS  [1] The applicants face charges under the Resource Management Act 1991 which relate to non-compliance with the conditions of a resource consent. It is a condition  LESLIE WILLIAM FUGLE v R [2017] NZSC 24 [8 March 2017]  of the resource consent that the site be subject to a weekly monitoring programme to assess compliance with the consent. As well s 332 of the RMA authorises local authority enforcement officers to inspect land and buildings (but not dwellinghouses) for compliance.   [2] Prior to charges being laid, enforcement officers made 13 visits to the site.  The applicants say that after the second of the visits it must have been apparent that offences were being committed and that, from that point, there was no longer power to carry out inspections under s 332. Rather, a search warrant under s 334 should have been sought.  [3] This argument was fully addressed in the District Court by Judge Thompson and in the Court of Appeal.1 Both Judge Thompson and the Court of Appeal concluded that on all occasions, the primary purpose of the visits was to monitor compliance and that they were accordingly within the scope of s 332(1). This finding of fact does not appear to be specifically challenged by the applicants and if it were, such challenge would not warrant the grant of leave to appeal. In light of the finding of fact, we see no arguable basis for the contention that the inspections were unlawful.  [4] Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed. For fair trial reasons we make an order prohibiting publication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in news media or on the internet or other publically available database until final disposition of trial. Publication in law report or law digest permitted.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA7/2013 [2017] NZCA 46   BETWEEN DEREK LESTER KING Appellant  AND THE QUEEN Respondent   Court: Harrison, Heath and Collins JJ  Counsel: Appellant in person J Hurd for Respondent  Judgment: 7 March 2017 at 10.15 am (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application is declined.   REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given byHarrison J)  [1] In a judgment delivered on 29 October 2015 this Court dismissed an appeal by the applicant, Derek King, against his conviction in the High Court for numerous sexual offences and his sentence of preventive detention.1  [2] On 13 February 2017 Mr King filed a voluminous four-part application to recall our judgment on numerous grounds. The Crown opposes his application on a number of grounds.   [3] We reject the application for these reasons:  King v R [2015] NZCA506.  KINGV R [2017] NZCA46[7 March 2017]  (a)  Mr King has failed to show a fundamental error in procedure in this Court’s determination of his appeal or that a substantial miscarriage of justice would result if there was. Our decision to refuse Mr King’s application for an adjournment took into account all relevant factors including our satisfaction that he had abused the Court’s processes by engineering a situation where he remained unrepresented and certain medical records were unavailable. In any event, we were satisfied that none of Mr King’s grounds of appeal against his conviction or sentencewere arguable.   (b)  As this Court emphasised in R v Smith, the power to recall is not be exercised where an applicant has an effective remedy reasonably available.2 Mr King is aware of his rights to appeal to the SupremeCourt.3 In a minute issued on 16 December 2016, the Supreme Court referred to documents filed by Mr King in its Registry between August and November, and his later application to the Registrar to withdraw his scheduling of “a non existence application” for an appeal. Mr King’s conduct as narrated in the Supreme Court’s minute is consistent with his approach to the substantive appeal in this Court. Mr King knows of his entitlement to apply for leave to appeal but after taking affirmative steps to advance that right of appeal to the Supreme Court he has made a deliberate decision not to exercise it.  Hemust accept the consequences.   (c)  Adecision to recallwithin the Court’s inherent power is onlymadein exceptional circumstances. A party should not seek recourse to that power if it might undermine the general principle of finality. In our judgment MrKing is seeking to undermine that principle here.    [4] The application to recallis dismissed.

B We make no award of costs.  REASONS  [1] This is an application for leave to appeal against a decision of the Court of Appeal.1 In that decision, the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal against a decision of the High Court2 declining an application bythe applicant for suppression of the names and identifying particulars of witnesses who were to give evidence for  1 Y v Attorney-General [2016] NZCA 474, [2016] NZAR 1512 (Stevens, Wild and WinkelmannJJ) [Y v Attorney-General (CA)].  2 Y v Attorney-General [2015]NZHC 844 (BrownJ).  YvTHE ATTORNEY-GENERAL[2017] NZSC 26 [7 March2017]  the applicant in his civil claims against the Crown.  Those claims relate to allegations of abuse and ill-treatment suffered while in the care of the Ministry of Social Development. An exception was made in relation to one witness (referred to in the Court ofAppeal judgment as “CW”) in respect of whom the Court ofAppeal made a suppression order.3  [2] The Court has been informed that the underlying proceeding has been settled, and that there will therefore be no trial. The applicant asks that the application for leave to appeal nevertheless be advanced, and argues that leave is appropriate because the Court of Appeal decision raises issues of importance and the fact that that Court was divided shows that these issues are arguable.  We do not consider it is appropriate to give leave in these circumstances. The interim suppression order was made pending the trial, but there will now be no trial.  [3] We therefore formally dismiss the application for leave to appeal.  [4] The respondent did not file submissions on the application. In those circumstances, we make no award of costs.

[2] In my judgment, I indicated that the respondent was entitled to costs, and expressed a preliminary view that the case was not one where there should be any uplift on standard "2B" costs. However I did not hear fully from counsel on the question of costs. I accordingly directed that any memorandum from the respondent seeking costs was to be filed by 31 January 2017, and any reply memorandum by Mr Emmott by 14 February 2017.  [3] The respondent duly filed a costs memorandum on 31 January 2017. No costs memorandum has been filed by Mr Emmott.  EMMOTT v MICHAEL WILSON & PARTNERS LIMITED [2017] NZHC 359 [7 March 2017]  [4] While the respondent initially submitted that increased costs should be awarded, in his memorandum of 31 January 2017 Mr Sullivan accepted that costs on a 2B basis are appropriate. He submitted a schedule with his memorandum, setting out a 2B costs calculation totalling $9,254.50 plus disbursements (filing fee on notice of opposition and sealing fee on the order made by the comi) totalling $160.00.  [5] I am satisfied that that claim is correctly made in accordance with schedules 2 and 3 of the High Court Rules. There will accordingly be judgment for the respondent for costs in the sum of $9,254.50, plus disbursements of $160.00.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 138/2016 [2017] NZSC 21   BETWEEN  MARK ALBERT HORSFALL Applicant   AND  DIANA JANE POTTER First Respondent   168 GROUPLIMITED Second Respondent   Court:  William Young, Glazebrook and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  T G Stapleton QC forApplicant J R Billington QC, R ANewberry and T Cleary for First Respondent R J B Fowler QC for Second Respondent   Judgment:  2 March 2017    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is granted (Potter v Horsfall [2016] NZCA 514).  B The approved question is whether the Court of Appeal was right to find that the disposition of the proceeds of the College Street property was made by the applicant to defeat the claim or rights of the first respondent for the purposes of s 44 of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976.  REASONS  [1] One of the issues raised in this appeal is the principle discussed in Potter v  Potter (and in subsequent cases).1 Given that the principle is in issue as a result of  the position adopted by the appellant for tax purposes, and that the principle has, in  any event, wider public policy implications, we consider that we may be assisted by  Potter v Potter [2003] 3 NZLR 145 (CA), aff’d Potter v Potter [2004] UKPC 41, [2005] 2 NZLR 1.  MARK ALBERTHORSFALLv DIANAJANE POTTER [2017] NZSC 21 [2 March2017]  submissions from the Crown on the relevant policy considerations.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND SC MA 13/2016 [2017] NZSC 19  INTHE MATTER OF ANAPPLICATIONBYMALCOLM EDWARD RABSON Applicant  Court: Elias CJ, William Young, Glazebrook, O'Regan and Ellen France JJ  Counsel: M E Rabson in person  Judgment: 2 March 2017   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for review is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] This is an application for review of a decision of Arnold J by minute of 19December 2016. In that minute, Arnold J dealtwith an application byMr Rabson for recall of this Court’s judgment in Erceg v Erceg.1 Arnold J noted that Mr Rabson was not a party to the Erceg v Erceg litigation, nor did he have a qualifying interest in it. He ruled, therefore, that Mr Rabson had no standing to seek a recall of the Court’s judgment. He also noted that the grounds on which recall was sought were misplaced.  [2] In Greer v Smith, this Court set out the approach to be taken in relation to applications for access to Court records otherwise than by parties to the proceedings.2 It determined that applications for access to Court records otherwise  1 Erceg v Erceg [2016] NZSC 135. 2 Greer v Smith [2015] NZSC 196, (2015) 22 PRNZ785.  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON [2017] NZSC 19[2 March 2017]  than by parties to proceedings should be directed to a Judge. It also concluded that there was no statutory right to seek a review of a decision by a Judge determining such an application and no statutory jurisdiction to review such a decision.3  [3] We consider that the same approach should be applied to an application for recall of a judgment by a person who is not a party to the litigation to which the judgment relates and has no potentially qualifying interest in the proceeding. That means there is no statutory right to seek a review and no statutory jurisdiction to reviewin the present case .  [4] We therefore dismiss the application for review for want of jurisdiction.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND CHRISTCHURCH REGISTRY CRI-2017-409-000022 [2017] NZHC 290  BETWEEN  DARREN ALBERT JOLLY Appellant   AND  TELEVISION NEW ZEALAND LIMITED First Respondent   DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS Second Respondent   Hearing:  28 February 2017    Appearances: R R Ward for Appellant  N Ullal for First Respondent  C Boshier and C Bernhardt for Second Respondent  Judgment: 28 February 2017  ORAL JUDGMENT OF GENDALL J  [1] Thank you counsel for your submissions. I am going to give my decision now. The detailed reasons for my decision will follow because of time constraints, but I will give my decision with respect to matters before the Court now.  [2] Before the Court is a matter brought by the appellant, Mr Jolly, concerning a decision of Judge Roberts in the District Court given on 25 January 2017. Judge  Roberts’s decision on that date was one granting Television New Zealand Limited’s application to allow in-court media video recording of the appellant’s upcoming sentencing hearing at the Christchurch District Court on 8 March 2017.  [3] Mr Jolly has filed in this Court a notice of general appeal against that decision of Judge Roberts. Issues arise here as to whether Judge Roberts’ decision under the in-court media guidelines is properly appealable but, in any event, before  JOLLY v TELEVISION NEW ZEALAND LIMITED [2017] NZHC 290 [28 February 2017]  me Mr Ward counsel for Mr Jolly, referred to para 17 of his written submissions today indicating that in a broad sense, in the alternative, matters before the Court could be considered a judicial review of that decision of Judge Roberts in terms of s 27(2) of the Bill of Rights Act 1990.  [4] Today I have received submissions on these matters from Mr Ward counsel for Mr Jolly, Ms Ullal counsel for TVNZ, and Ms Boshier for the Crown.   [5] In considering those submissions I am of the clear view that Mr Jolly’s application to this Court, be it by way of appeal or by way of judicial review of the decision of Judge Roberts dated 25 January 2007 must fail and it is dismissed. My detailed reasons for this decision will follow.   ...................................................

EDITORIAL NOTE: NO SUPPRESSION APPLIED.  IN THE DISTRICT COURT   AT HAMILTON   CRI-2016-019-004445   [2017] NZDC 4002   THE QUEEN   v   TAMATE GOUGH   Hearing:  28 February 2017   Appearances:  D McWilliam for the Crown   J Hamblett for the Defendant   Judgment:  28 February 2017    NOTES OF JUDGE R G MARSHALL ON SENTENCING  [1] Mr Gough appears for sentence on seven charges of burglary and six charges of unlawfully taking a motor vehicle. He has pleaded guilty to those charges following a sentence indication that I gave to him on 5 December last year. In that sentence indication I set out the circumstances of the offending, I dealt with the aggravating and mitigating features and also the various relevant case law and starting points. What I determine, Mr Gough, was in respect of these ram raids which involved 55 to $57,000 worth of damage to premises and also involved items taken and a further $24,000 damage to vehicles used in the ram raid that a starting point of four years and three months was appropriate. You are 17 years of age and  still young so I gave you a credit of 15 percent for that which was eight months’  discount. From that I gave you a further 20 percent or close to 20 percent of a guilty plea and that brought it back to a further allowance of nine months. That left an end  sentence of 34 months’ imprisonment or two years and 10 months.  R v TAMATE GOUGH [2017] NZDC 4002 [28 February 2017]  [2] I have considered your pre-sentence report. You are seen as high risk of offending and a harm to others and there is an ongoing pattern of offending over the years. I do not see that there are any other credits available to you and also I note that you are not in a position to pay any reparation. Accordingly, the end sentence in respect of the charges of burglary will be two years and 10 months' imprisonment and on the charges of unlawfully taking a motor vehicle, 12 months' imprisonment. All terms will be concurrent so the end sentence is one of two years and 10 months' imprisonment.  R G Marshall District Court Judge 
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA79/2017 [2017] NZCA 26  BETWEEN  NIGELFRASER GOWING   Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN   Respondent   Counsel:  N M Dutch forApplicant   M LWong for Respondent   Judgment:  24 February 2017 at 4.30 pm    (On the papers)  (BAIL) JUDGMENT OF WILD J   The application is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] This is an application for bail pending appeal. Sections 14 and 55 of the Bail Act 2000 apply, as does s 343 of the Criminal ProcedureAct 2011.  [2] Having been convicted on a charge of injuring with intent to injure, on 20 January Mr Gowing was sentenced to six months home detention. He filed a notice of appeal in this Court on 17 February and today, 24 February, applied for bail pending the hearing of that appeal.  [3] The nub of the appeal is in paragraph 4 of Mr Dutch’s memorandum dated today:  GOWING v R [2017] NZCA26[24February2017]  A delay in hearing will effectively render the sentence aspect of the appeal nugatory. By the time of hearing the appellant is likely to have served much of his home detention sentence.  [4] The short answer to this application is to bring the appeal on for hearing promptly. Time is available in Auckland on Thursday9 March and Ihave pencilled this appeal in with an estimated hearing time of one hour.  [5] Quite apart from the ability to hear the appeal promptly, I would not have granted bail. I cannot see here the exceptional circumstances that this Court has held are required,1 and the fact that Mr Gowing’s sentence of home detention might have been largely completed by the time the appeal was heard (even if it were the case) is not sufficient to justify bail pending appeal.2  [6] For those reasons theapplication is dismissed.  [7] Mr Dutch should contact this Court’s Registry to firm up the 9 March fixture and agree urgent timetabling of submissions with the Crown.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date……………  In the estate ofBEAVER [2017] NZHC 241[23 February2017]  [1] Neil William Beaver died in Fiji on or about 26 December 2014. He left a will dated 3 November 2010 in which he directed that his residuary estate was to be divided into two equal parts. The first part was to be distributed to his then de-facto partner Filomena Taina and to her children in the event that she did not survive him. The balance of the residuary estate was to be divided between such of Mr Beaver’s threechildren as survived him.   [2] The executors of Mr Beaver’s will have now obtained probate in both New Zealand and Fiji and have realised all of Mr Beaver’s assets.  This has resulted in the estate receiving a total sum of approximately $120,000 less expenses.   [3] The executors have not yet been able to locate Ms Taina notwithstanding advertisements they have placed in the Fiji Times newspaper and enquiries they have made regarding her whereabouts through a firm of solicitors in Fiji.   [4] The executors of Mr Beaver’s will now seek an order authorising them to distribute Mr Beaver’s entire estate between his three children in equal shares. Alternatively, they seek an order that Ms Taina’s share of the estate be debited with the costs the executors have incurred in attempting to locate her and the balance thereafter remaining be held on trust.  [5] I consider it is too early at this stage to authorise the distribution of Ms Taina’s one-half share of the estate to the three children of the deceased. I therefore makeorders in terms ofthealternativeapplication advanced bythe executors. In the event that Ms Taina has not come forward by 31 December 2017, the executors should renew their application. In the meantime, the executors should place quarterly advertisements in a daily Fiji newspaper seeking to establish contact with Ms Taina.  Lang J  Solicitors: Wardill Pasley Law,Auckland

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2017-485-96 [2017] NZHC 220  IN THE MATTER OF Section 14 of the Wills Act 2007  IN THE MATTER OF  the estate ofNICHOLAS PETER WHITE (deceased)   Hearing:  On the papers   Counsel:  TE Hesketh   Judgment:  21 February 2017     JUDGMENT OF CLIFFORD J  [1] This is an application under s 14 of the Wills Act 2007, commenced by way of originating application as required by High Court Rule 19.2(xa), to declare a document to be a valid will. The applicant, the father of the deceased Nicholas Peter White whose estate is at issue (Mr White snr), also applies to proceed on a without notice basis.  [2] I deal first with the application to proceed without notice. Mr White senior has provided affidavit evidence to the effect that the only persons with a beneficial interest in the estate of Nicholas White are himself, Nicholas White's mother, Alison Rae White, and Nicholas White's brother, Simon William White. Mr White snr and Mr White's mother and brother consent to the order sought being made. Mr White snr has also, by affidavit, confirmed that Nicholas White was not survived by a spouse, de facto partner or children entitled to succeed on testacy or any other children. Mr White snr refers to various enquiries that have been made in that regard.  [3] On that basis, I am satisfied that it is appropriate for this application to proceed without notice to any other paiiies.  RE WHITE (DECEASED) [2017] NZHC 220 [21 February 2017]  [4] I tum now to the substance of the application.  [5] Mr White snr annexed to his affidavit the document in question (the Document). The Document is a typed and handwritten document prepared by Mr White snr, signed by Nicholas White, and witnessed by Mr White snr. The Document is clearly intended to be Nicholas White's last will and testament. Nicholas White has not only signed the Document, but also initialled the Document where it has been completed in handwriting. Mr White snr, in his affidavit, has given evidence of the circumstances in which the will was prepared and signed by Nicholas White in his presence, and also in the presence of Nicholas White's mother, Mrs White. Mrs White has confirmed those circumstances in her affidavit. The Whites were simply unaware of the need for a will to be signed in the presence of, and witnessed by, two persons.  [6] The Document records Nicholas White's decision to leave all his estate to his brother Simon White.  [7] I am satisfied that in terms of s 14 of the Wills Act 2007 it is appropriate that an order be made declaring the Document to be the valid will of Nicholas Peter White, deceased, of Palmerston Notih, New Zealand, finance manager. There is an order accordingly.  Solicitors: Jacobs Florentine, Palmerston North  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV 2015-085-326 (2017] NZHC 216  UNDER the Companies Act 1993 IN THE MATTER of Muse on Allen Restaurant BETWEEN MUSE ON ALLEN LIMITED  Plaintiff  AND  JOZSEF GABOR SZEKELY   Defendant   Hearing:  21 February 2017   Counsel:  No appearance for Plaintiff   Q S Haines for Defendant   Judgment:  21 February 2017    JUDGMENT OF ELLIS J  [l] On 27 May 2016 Brown J ordered that Mr North pay 2B third party costs to Mr Szekely following a successful strike out application.1 After some to-ing and fro-ing between his lawyers and the Registry an order was sealed in which the costs owing were said to be $11,373. That sum comprised seven discrete costs items, as was made clear in a schedule to the order.  [2] Mr North subsequently filed an application for a review of that sealed order. He took issue with three of the costs items listed in the Schedule.2 The ground for the application was that the three items related to steps taken in other proceedings involving the North family and Mr Szekely, namely CIV-2013-485-9825.  Muse on Allen Ltdv Szekely [2016] NZHC 1131. In fact the application appears to take issue with four items, but one of them did not exist.  MUSE ON ALLEN LTD v SZEKELY [2017] NZHC 216 [21 February 2017]  [3] On 8 November Associate Judge Smith noted that he did not have jurisdiction to determine the application and ordered a two hour fixture before a Justice of the Comi at the earliest possible juncture. He also directed that Mr No1ih pay the undisputed amount of $5,129 by 29 November 2016. This Mr Nmih duly did.  [4] The review application came before me this morning. Mr Szekely had filed a notice of opposition and affidavit in support. The affidavit showed that the case management memoranda which gave rise to the disputed costs items were in fact filed in relation to both CIV-2013-485-9825 and the present proceeding. Mr Haines confirmed that no claim for the costs associated with those memoranda will be made in the CIV-2013-485-9825 matter (which was heard last week by Mallon J).  [5] Although Mr Nmih had been sent notice of the hearing date he did not appear this morning. Nor had he filed any submissions or other material taking issue with the position just outlined.  [6] On that basis, and on the basis of the evidence before the Comi, I agree with Mr Haines that the application should be dismissed and I so order. Mr Szekely is, again, entitled to his 2B costs.  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CIV 2015-404-000568 [2017] NZHC 187  BETWEEN MACHELLEANNE MORRIS Plaintiff  AND PETER JOHN MORRIS Defendant  Hearing: On the papers  Appearances: T J Raineyfor the Plaintiff D Chambers QC for the Defendants  Judgment: 17 February 2017  JUDGMENT AS TO COSTS OF ASSOCIATE JUDGE CHRISTIANSEN  This judgment was delivered by me on  17.02.17 at 3:30 pm, pursuant to Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules.  Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date……………  MAMORRIS v PJ MORRIS [2017] NZHC 187[17 February2017]  [1] On 20 July 2015 I heard Ms Morris’ summary judgment application. At the conclusion of the hearing I issued an oral judgment dismissing the summary judgment application and ordered costs be paid to Mr Morris on a 2B basis.  [2] On 25 August 2016 Ms Chambers emailed a memorandum to the Court on behalf of Mr Morris as to costs. The submissions of Mr Rainey on behalf of the plaintiff were emailed to the Court on 13 February 2017. That memorandum records that the parties agreed to settle their litigation on a drop hands basis. Ms Chambers confirmed Mr Morris agreed to settle all matters subject to the existing order as to costs Iearlier made.  [3] As Mr Rainey submits it is clear that the only costs that the defendant is entitled to are those I ordered were payable when dismissing the application for summary judgment.  [4] Mr Rainey’s calculations adopt steps 23, 24, 26 and 29 of Schedule 3.   [5] Ms Chambers’calculations are more wide-ranging. In the Court’s view they include items that should not form part of the costs payable in this case, including for the commencement of a defence and the filing of a statement of defence.  [6] In the Court’s view Mr Rainey’s assessment is more accurate. However, the Court considers costs should include an allowance for the filing of affidavits in opposition. Three of those were filed. For the first two of those the Court will allow fortwo days at the category2 rate of $1,990 per day.  For the third of those the Court will allow a half day at the category 2 rate of $2,230 per day.  [7] Apart from those additional matters, the Court considers Mr Rainey’s assessment ought to be adopted except that the category 2 rate of $1,990 per day is to apply for the filing of the opposition and the two first affidavits in opposition to summary judgment. Steps taken after 1 July 2015 are to be fixed at the category 2 rate of $2,230 per day.  [8] Ms Morris is also to paythe $50 for the sealing of judgment costs.  Associate Judge Christiansen   
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND SC 130/2016 [2017] NZSC 9  BETWEEN GARY OWEN BURGESS Applicant AND MALLEY& CO Respondents Court: William Young, Glazebrook and Arnold JJ Counsel: Applicant in person A J Gaborieau for Respondents Judgment: 16February 2017   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant must pay costs of $2,500 to the respondents.    REASONS  [1] The applicant, Mr Burgess, has appealed to the Court of Appeal against a decision of Gendall J in the High Court, in which he ordered Mr Burgess to pay the respondents, Malley & Co, outstanding fees and disbursements for legal services, together with interest.1 In the same judgment, Gendall J dismissed a number of claims brought by Mr Burgess against Malley & Co alleging negligence and other failings by the firm.   [2] In conjunction with filing the appeal in the Court of Appeal, Mr Burgess applied for a dispensation from the requirement to pay security for costs; for their part, Malley & Co applied for an increased amount by way of security. The  Malley & Co v Burgess [2016]NZHC 907.  GARYOWEN BURGESS v MALLEY&CO [2017] NZSC 9 [16 February2017]  Deputy-Registrar declined to waive security and increased the amount payable from the usual $6,600 to $10,000.  [3] Mr Burgess then applied to have these decisions reviewed by a Judge.  Miller J upheld the Deputy-Registrar’s decision not to waive security but granted the application to review the increased amount, reducing it to $6,600.2 Mr Burgess now seeks leave to appeal to this Court against Miller J’s decision to uphold the Deputy-Registrar’s decision to refuse to waive security.  [4] These proceedings arise from a long-running relationship property dispute between Mr Burgess and his former partner. Malley & Co represented Mr Burgess in the relationship property proceedings.  [5] It is not suggested that the proposed appeal raises any issue of general or publicimportance. Rather, Mr Burgess argues thatMiller J erred bymisapplyingthe principles articulated by this Court in Reekie v Attorney-General3 and by incorrectly assessing the merits of his appeal against Gendall J’s decision.  [6] As to the first point, Miller J’s decision was an orthodox application of the principles set out in Reekie. We are not persuaded that the principles have, or may have been, misapplied.  [7] As to the second point, Miller J concluded that the appeal was, in some respects, hopeless and in others “not strong”. Again, nothing has been raised to cast doubt on this preliminary evaluation.  [8] In these circumstances, we dismiss the application for leave to appeal.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2016-485-608605 [2017] NZHC 180  UNDER the Administration Act 1969  IN THE ESTATE  of Edna Alice Beasley ( deceased)   BETWEEN  mDITH EDNA BOWLES, EDWARD JOHN BEASLEY AND IRENE ANNE JOSEPH Applicants   AND  RAYMOND BEASLEY Respondent   Hearing:  On the papers    Counsel: M J McKay for applicants D F Tyree for Respondent  Judgment: 16 February 2017  JUDGMENT OF COLLINS J Costs  [1] By memorandum dated 31 September 2016 the applicants agreed to renounce their appointment as executors of the estate of the late Edna Beasley. The parties agreed to Prudential Guardian obtaining probate of the will of Edna Beasley and that costs be reserved. The Court made orders to that effect.  [2] Since then the parties have failed to reach agreement as to costs. Disputes have arisen about the appropriateness of evidence being referred to in a memorandum and affidavit, and the scale of costs that is applicable. There is also a dispute as to whether or not appropriate steps were taken to settle this matter before proceedings were issued.  BOWLES & ORS v BEASLEY [2017] NZHC 180 [16 February 2017]  [3] I have viewed the file and record that the parties agreed to the Court determining the issue of costs by relying on the materials in the papers.  [4] While it has taken some time for this matter to be resolved it is a straight forward case that bears many of the characteristics of In re Tai in which Baragwanath J awarded the applicants costs on a scale 1 A basis. 1  [5] In my assessment, that is the appropriate level of costs that the applicants should receive in this case. I order accordingly.   DB Collins J  Solicitors: Malley & Co, Christchurch for Applicants Rainey Collins, Wellington for Respondent  In Re Tai Rotorua HC CIV-2006-463-669, 7 Februaiy 2007.  
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA17/2017 [2017] NZCA 9  BETWEEN  RICHIE STUART CLUTTERBUCK Appellant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Counsel:  Appellant in person C J Hurd for Respondent   Judgment:  14 February 2017    (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF HARRISON J  Application for bail pending determination of appeal is declined.   REASONS  [1] Following a trial in the Christchurch District Court the appellant, Richie Clutterbuck, was found guilty of one count of burglary of a timber yard. In December 2016 he was convicted and sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment. He appeals against his conviction on the principal ground of trial counsel error.   [2] MrClutterbuck has applied for bail pending appeal. The Crown opposes.  MrClutterbuck must establish that on the balance of probabilities he should be granted bail pending appeal.1 He must show exceptional circumstances exist. Within that inquiry the apparent strength of his appeal and any delay causing injustice are relevant considerations.    See Bail Act 2000, ss14 and 55.  CLUTTERBUCK V R [2017] NZCA9 [14 February2017]  [3] MrClutterbuck has sent abriefletter to the Court settingout his grounds for seeking bail. First, he submits that a recent stomach operation (apparently before his trial) is causing him dietarydifficultieswithin the prison environment.  Hehas had to rely on his family and friends to buy his own food. However, Mr Clutterbuck has not produced evidence of either the adverse effect of this medical condition or that he cannot be properlycared for within the prison. This ground must fail.  [4] Second, Mr Clutterbuck refers to his primary ground of appeal that his trial counsel failed to follow his instructions in a number of respects including producing medical records of his stomach operation. Apart from general allegations in his notice of appeal, Mr Clutterbuck has not provided any particulars or specific information or evidence which might support this allegation.   [5] It is well settled that it is not appropriate when determining an application for bail pending an appeal to undertake an analysis of the merits or of the prospects of success. Evidence that the appeal has some strength may be a relevant factor. But that is not the case here. Apart from assertions, Mr Clutterbuck has not identified anything to suggest that his appeal has merit or is even arguable. Moreover, MrClutterbuck faces the inherent difficultythat the lower Court byits finding of guilt must have rejected the credibility of his exculpatory evidence at trial, including of his recent stomach operation.  [6] MrClutterbuck’s application forbailpending determination ofhis appealis declined.   Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent

EDITORIAL NOTE: NO SUPRESSION APPLIED.  IN THE DISTRICT COURT AT CHRISTCHURCH CRI-2016-009-003474 [2017] NZDC 2794  NEW ZEALAND POLICE  Prosecutor  v   TYRONE GEORGE WHITTAKER  Defendant  Hearing: 14 February 2017  Appearances: Acting Sergeant O King for the Prosecutor C Eason for the Defendant  Judgment: 14 February 2017  NOTES OF JUDGE T J GILBERT ON SENTENCING  [1] Mr Whittaker you are for sentence today on one charge of assault with intent to injure.  This has come before me in the number one list.  [2] The summary records that you were here in the Christchurch courthouse and after being remanded in custody another prisoner was downstairs. He was in the cell first. You came in afterwards. There were other prisoners around at the time. You do not know the person from a bar of soap and neither does he know you according to the summary.   [3] You then balled up some toilet paper, threw it up onto the CCTV camera to hide the view, walked over to where the victim was seated, and kicked him in the head with the heel of your foot. He slumped forward and you did it again. The  NEW ZEALAND POLICE v TYRONE GEORGE WHITTAKER [2017] NZDC 2794 [14 February 2017]  police intervened. As a result of this the victim was taken to hospital where he spent a number of hours and suffered, fortunately, injuries that were not that serious.  [4] As Mr Eason has explained to me, you are currently serving a three year two month sentence for charges of aggravated robbery and burglary. For some reason this was not sentenced at the same time but I now need to impose what effectively is an uplift on that sentence of three years two months to reflect the seriousness of this matter.   [5] As I have discussed with Mr Eason, from my review of matters this is a very serious incident in terms of charges of assault with intent to injure. You are probably lucky it was not charged as a more serious offence.  [6] In my assessment the appropriate starting point is two years bearing in mind the three year maximum available on this charge. I would then give you a discount of around about five months to account for your guilty plea which was reasonably early, but not at the earliest opportunity. Finally, I need to take into account the totality principle because this is going to sit on top of the current sentences which you are serving.  [7] With all of that in mind, you will be convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for 10 months on this charge which will be cumulative on the current sentence which you are serving. Because your sentences total in excess of two years, the Parole Board will impose release conditions upon you.  T J Gilbert District Court Judge  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  [20 SC 7/2017 17] NZSC 2   BETWEEN HYUN SU PARK Applicant   AND  JOONG SONG KWAKKWAK First Respondents  AND  HYE SOOK   ANDREW J STEELEAJARRED SCOTT Second Respondents  ND   TIM J RAINEYAND JONATHAN WOOD Third Respondents    Court: William Young, Glazebrook and O'Regan JJ Counsel: Applicant in person Judgment 9 February 2017  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  B Costs of $2,500 are awarded to the third respondents.    REASONS  Background  [1] On appeal from adecision ofthe Weathertight Homes Tribunal, the applicant, as a builder and developer of a leaky home, was held to be liable to the first respondents (the subsequent purchasers of the home).1  Kwak v Park [2016]NZHC 530 (Woolford J).  HYUN SU PARK v JOONGSONGKWAK ANDHYE SOOK KWAK [2017] NZSC 2 [9 February2017]  [2] Leave to appeal against the High Court decision was declined by that Court on 6 October 2016.2 This was on the basis that there was no jurisdiction for a further appeal. As pointed out by Woolford J, the Court of Appeal in Osborne v Auckland Council was satisfied:3  …that the specific provisions of s 95(2)(b) of the [Weathertight Homes Resolution Services Act 2006 Act] prevail over and exclude both the application of the general right of appeal under s 66 of the Judicature Act [1908] and the right to apply for leave to appeal against a decision of the High Court conferred by s67 ofthatAct.  [3] Theapplicant nevertheless tried to file an appeal in the Court ofAppeal.  The Registrar refused to accept this appeal for filing. That decision was upheld by KósP.4 The applicant now applies to this Court for leave to appeal.   [4] We note that the parties named as second and third respondents acted as counsel for the first respondents at various stages of the proceedings.  They were not parties to the proceedings and should not therefore have been named as respondents to this application.   Disposition  [5] This Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this application. The High Court judgment was final.  It is therefore dismissed.  [6] The third respondents filed a memorandum explaining the background.5 It is thus appropriate to make an award of costs of $2,500 in their favour.

    IN THE DISTRICT COURT  AT WHANGAREI    CRI-2016-088-002742    [2017] NZDC 2309       NEW ZEALAND POLICE    Prosecutor    v        NATHAN JOEL DIB  Defendant           Hearing:     8 February 2017      Appearances:     Sergeant P Rankin for the Prosecutor  K Johnson for the Defendant      Judgment:     8 February 2017         NOTES OF JUDGE K B de RIDDER ON SENTENCING     [1] Mr Dib, on 1 December you sought a sentence indication on a charge of burglary and the Judge who dealt with that indicated an end sentence of three years’ imprisonment before any reductions for mitigating factors, and the matter was put off for you to consider and you came before me on 12 December and pleaded guilty to this charge on the basis of that indication.   [2] I do not propose to go through exhaustively the summary of facts or the analysis embarked on by the Judge who gave you that sentence indication.  Shortly put though, sometime between 4 o'clock and 12 o'clock between 27 and 28 May you went to this private residence here in Whangarei, forced entry by jimmying a ranchslider and took a significant number of items from the house, including a computer and a number of items of jewellery.    [3] In particular, these items had great significance and sentimental value to the owner because of the history of the jewellery and also the large amount of personal information stored on the computer.   [4] The matter does not have to go back before the Judge who gave you the indication because I have read his notes carefully, and with respect I agree with his analysis and am prepared to follow it.  The only issue is by how much I should reduce that start point.   [5] In my view, the only mitigating factor is your guilty plea and the issue is simply how much I should reduce that start point for that plea.  The Judge who gave you the indication indicated he would not give the maximum of one quarter and I agree entirely with that, given the length of time it took before this matter was finally resolved by your guilty plea.   [6] Also another factor which the Supreme Court referred to in the case of Hessell v R1 was the likelihood of conviction and that tends to water down any benefit for a guilty plea.  In this case, any chances of you escaping a conviction on this charge were very slim indeed, based on the fact that you were caught by DNA evidence and you were also caught by a production order which revealed text data where you were trying to sell gold rings and a laptop computer on the same night as the burglary.   [7] Taking those two factors into account, in my view the discount would be reasonably generous even at 15 percent.  On that basis, on this charge you are convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for two years and six months and you are ordered to pay reparation of $1000 to the complainant.  Finally, your current sentences of community work and supervision are cancelled.    1 Hessell v R [2010] NZSC 135, [2011] 1 NZLR 607            K B de Ridder  District Court Judge

REASONS  Introduction  [1] On 31 August 2016 the Court issued a decision1 in respect of an appeal by H Benson and Others2 against a decision of Kapiti Coast District Council granting   [2016] NZEnvC 169. 2 Lorraine Edwards, Melanie and Michael Galvin, Ana Matsis, Charles Norwood and Helen Benson.  H BENSON and OTHERS & DENHAM CONSTRUCTION LIMITED v KAPITI COAST DISTRICT COUNCIL  2  resource consent to Denham Construction Limited (Denham) allowing the establishment and operation of a medical centre and associated pharmacy (the Centre) at 41-43 Te Moana Road, Waikanae.  [2] The Court disallowed the appeal and determined that consent ought be granted to the Centre.  [3] The Court issued an interim costs decision3 on 31 January 2017 finding that a costs award would be made but directing Denham to advise whether or not it was able to claim GST on the costs it incurred. Denham has advised the Court that it was entitled to claim GST.  [4] On the basis that the Court's decision was to award 30 per cent of planner's costs (i.e. $7,067.40) and 50 per cent of all other costs (i.e. $37,425.50), total costs would be $44,492.90 (including GST). Denham advises that the amount of claimable GST was $5,803.42. The costs award the Court will make is therefore $38,689.48.  Order  [5] The Appellants, Lorraine Edwards, Melanie and Michael Galvin, Ana Matsis, Charles Norwood and Helen Benson, are to pay to Denham Construction Limited the sum of $38,689.48. The Appellants are jointly and severally liable for this award.  [6] ' may be enforced in the District Court at Porirua, if necessary.   J)<I  ~ ~  BP Dwyer Environment Judge   I  [2017] NZEnvC 7.  
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA129/2016 [2017] NZCA 2  BETWEEN  MICHAEL MARINO Appellant   AND  THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFTHE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS Respondent   Court:  Kós P, Miller and Cooper JJ   Counsel:  D AEwen and G K Edgeler forAppellant D J Perkins for Respondent   Judgment:  3 February 2017 at 11.00 am    (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT (On Costs)  The appellant will have costs as for a standard appeal on a band A basis, with provision for second counsel and usual disbursements.   REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given byMiller J)  [1] The Court has considered counsels’ submissions on costs following the appellant’s successful appeal to the Supreme Court.  [2] It is not in dispute that costs are payable on the civil scale. The question is whether the appellant ought to have indemnity or increased costs. As to that, we are in agreement with the respondent.  We make three points:  MARINO v THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENTOF CORRECTIONS [2017] NZCA2 [3 February2017]  (a)  There was nothing especially complex about the appeal. It was a question of statutoryconstruction, necessitating a review of legislative history;   (b)  Habeas Corpus is a summary procedure, and rarely should such an appeal take more time than a standard appeal. It is immaterial that a more extensive argument was mounted on further appeal, after MrMarino had been released;   (c)  Nothing about the respondent’s conduct justifies increased costs. Its view of the legislation was consistent with earlier judgments of this Court on sentence appeals.  Following the SupremeCourt judgment, it is established that Mr Marino was unlawfully detained, but compensation for that is a separate matter.    [3] Theappellant willhave costs as fora standard appeal on aband Abasis, with provision for second counsel (that is, a total of $13,380.00), with usual disbursements. We decline the respondent’s invitation to limit the award to costs actually paid by Mr Marino; that would be to exploit his counsel’s willingness to undertake work on a pro bono or discounted basis.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV 2016-485-165 [2017] NZHC 59  BETWEEN MICHAEL MARINO Applicant  AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS Respondent  Hearing: On Papers  Counsel: G Edgeler for Applicant D J Perkins for Respondent  Judgment: 1 February 2017  JUDGMENT OF SIMON FRANCE J (Costs)  [1] The applicant unsuccessfully sought a writ of habeas corpus. An appeal was similarly unsuccessful. However, the Supreme Court upheld the legitimacy of his arguments concerning how his sentence should be calculated. The effect of that judgment is that the writ should have issued.  [2] Mr Marino now seeks scale costs with a 50 per cent uplift for his original application. The respondent not only disputes the uplift but contends successful habeas corpus applicants are traditionally awarded even more modest amounts. admit to finding both positions unpersuasive.  MARINO v THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS [2017] NZHC 59 [1 February 2017]  [3] Addressing first Mr Marino, it was standard litigation conducted appropriately by the respondent. The Department was applying apparently settled, albeit incorrect law. The uplift seems to be motivated by a belief that scale costs are inadequate. That is an argument consistently rejected. Although strictly speaking the discretion granted under s 14(4) of the Habeas Corpus Act 1991 is wider than the Rules as to costs, in my view some good reason should still be needed to depart from them.  [4] The fact that habeas corpus involves the liberty of the subject is not such a reason. If there has been unlawful imprisonment, adequate routes exist for compensation. The focus should be on the nature and conduct of the particular proceeding.  [5] Similarly I see no reason for limiting costs to something less than scale. The respondent suggests there is some significance in the fact that it carries the onus, but I do not see that as a relevant reason to depart from the scale.  [6] The applicant is entitled to costs on a 2B basis. As is the norm, such costs cannot exceed the actual costs. Ifthere is disagreement as to disbursements, it is to be settled by the Registrar.

EDITORIAL NOTE: NO SUPPRESSION APPLIED.  IN THE DISTRICT COURT   AT NAPIER   CRI-2016-020-001594   [2017] NZDC 1017   THE QUEEN   v   HOHEPA HAORA NATHAN   Hearing:  19 January 2017   Appearances:  C Stuart for the Crown   A Willis for the Defendant   Judgment:  19 January 2017    NOTES OF JUDGE A J ADEANE ON SENTENCING  [1] Mr Nathan appears for sentence this morning having been convicted at a defended hearing of aggravated burglary. In fact he changed his plea but not until after the complainant had given evidence and it is sensibly accepted that there could be no talk about a discount for that guilty plea. It was simply an acknowledgement of an overwhelming Crown case.  [2] The facts are that by day Mr Nathan and others went to burgle the  complainant’s house. A significant amount of property was removed. The  complainant came home in the course of this and interrupted Mr Nathan. Amongst the property Mr Nathan had taken was a martial arts weapon called a Sai. It's presence in the home obviously did not alert Mr Nathan in the way it might have done but the bad choice he had made was that he was burgling the home of a martial arts expert. When that man confronted him Mr Nathan presented the Sai and advanced on the home owner with it but was soon disarmed. I am afraid I cannot  R v HOHEPA HAORA NATHAN [2017] NZDC 1017 [19 January 2017]  accept that the fact that the home owner was able to manage the situation as he did constitutes any sort of mitigating feature. The long and short of it is that Mr Nathan had got himself into possession of a weapon and when he thought he needed it to facilitate the burglary he produced it and advanced with it and the situation really is not much distinguishable from a situation where a weapon was taken to the property. There is a difference but the essential intent involved in this offending is not greatly different.  [3] There is not much disagreement about what the starting point should be.  There is disagreement about whether a minimum period of imprisonment should be imposed. The defendant is now over 30 years of age. He has previous convictions including 12 for burglary and one for aggravated robbery. There are no mitigating features to the case. In my view the correct starting point is one of four years’imprisonment for the offence itself to be uplifted by six months in respect to the defendant’s previous serious convictions of a similar kind.   [4] On the question of a minimum non-parole period it is certainly close to the threshold of that but I am not clearly satisfied that that is necessary. Mr Nathan will be before the Parole Board in due course and they can decide his release date according to progress if any made in prison.  A J Adeane District Court Judge  
EDITORIAL NOTE: NAMES AND/OR DETAILS IN THIS JUDGMENT HAVE BEEN ANONYMISED.  IN THE DISTRICT COURT AT HAMILTON CRI-2016-073-000289 [2017] NZDC 614  NEW ZEALAND POLICE  Prosecutor  v   CHRIS TIKAU  Defendant  Hearing: 17 January 2017  Appearances: Sergeant S McMaster for the Prosecutor A J Hamblett for the Defendant  Judgment: 17 January 2017   NOTES OF JUDGE P R CONNELL ON SENTENCING  [1] Mr Tikau you are for sentencing today on a number of charges that you received the sentence indication from the Court about. That indication was a total term of two years and four months’ imprisonment. Having got that you had time given to you to consider that and came back to Court and pleaded guilty to the offences before it.  [2] I do not intend to traverse the reasons why that sentence has come about and will direct that the notes I made at the time of that sentencing indication be attached to today’s notes and that will then complete the record and the reasons as to why I arrived at the sentence that I did. However you know that this all started when you in a very brutal way treated your partner to the point where she suffered severe injury and the most serious of the offences was the charge of injuring with intent to injure.  I have taken that as the lead offence today. I read your letter of apology and I have read your letter of remorse. Perhaps that has come about because of the  NEW ZEALAND POLICE v CHRIS TIKAU [2017] NZDC 614 [17 January 2017]  probation officer’s observations that you did not seem to be remorseful but I accept  that what you have written is a show of remorse and you have extended an apology not just to the victim but to her family and that is accepted. I do not intend to make any further deduction from sentence for that the indicated sentence was a relatively lenient one for the offences that you committed. There was the injuring with intent to injure. There was a burglary which is you getting into the place to carry out that injury. There is a charge of assault with intent, unlawfully carrying ammunition, receiving stolen property. There was another burglary included in all of this, there was a male assaults female charge, possession of instruments for using cannabis and also for possessing cannabis.  [3] The sentence that I will pass today, bearing in mind what I have just said, is the sentence of two years and four months’ imprisonment on the charge of injuring with intent. On the charge of burglary three months’ sentence concurrent. On the  charge assaulting with intent to injure your partner a 10 month concurrent sentence is  passed. On the charge of maleassaults female sixmonths’sentence is imposed and  then the charge of the other burglary one month sentence imposed concurrently. Possession of the cannabis convicted and discharged in light of the term of  imprisonment you have received. On the receiving charge three months’  imprisonment is imposed and on the charge that you were in possession of the ammunition one month imprisonment but that is concurrent as well. The final charge is possession of utensils for using cannabis you are convicted and discharged in respect of that. Both the supervision sentence and the community work that you are currently on both of those sentences have now been cancelled.  [4] Mr Tikau you will also have made today against you a protection order which will be in favour of your former partner and will contain the usual standard conditions of a protection order made in the Family Court. You will get some notice served on you about that.  P R Connell District Court Judge  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 151/2016 [2017] NZSC 1   BETWEEN  JAY MAUIWALLACE (AKAABDULLAH MAUIWARAHI) Applicant   AND  CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFTHE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS Respondent    Court: Arnold, O'Regan and Ellen France JJ Counsel: Applicant in person  A M Powell and M J McKillop for Respondent Judgment: 1 February 2017  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a decision of the Court of Appeal.1 In that decision, the Court of Appeal upheld a decision of Woodhouse J dismissing the applicant’s application for a writ of habeas corpus.2  [2] The background to the application is that the applicant was arrested on 17 October 2016 and charged with a number of offences. He was remanded in custody and refused bail, and the refusal of bail was upheld by the High Court on appeal.3 He then applied for a writ of habeas corpus and which was declined by Woodhouse J after a hearing on 6 December 2016. The applicant had been detained  1 Wallace v Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2016] NZCA 602 (Randerson,  Harrison andAsher JJ). 2 Wallace v Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2016] NZHC 2965 [Wallace (HC)]. 3 Police v Wallace [2016] NZDC 21345; Wallace v Police [2016] NZHC 2707.  WALLACE vCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFTHE DEPARTMENTOF CORRECTIONS [2017] NZSC 1 [1 February2017]  pursuant to a warrant issued by a District Court Judge on 2 December 2016, authorising the applicant’s detention until 21 June 2017. Woodhouse J noted that under s 14(2)(b) of the Habeas Corpus Act 2001, a judge considering application for habeas corpus is not entitled to call into question a ruling as to bail by a Court of competent jurisdiction.4 That applied in the present case, given the District Court and High Court bail rulings in relation to the applicant.  [3] TheCourt ofAppeal was satisfied that Woodhouse Jhad correctlyfoundthat the applicant was lawfully detained under a warrant issued by a District Court Judge and that nothing advanced by him had called into question the lawfulness of his detention.  It therefore dismissed his appeal.  [4] The applicant filed a number of documents in this Court in support of his application for leave, but none of these provided any basis for calling into question the lawfulness of his detention. Rather, the documentation appears to challenge the jurisdiction of the Courts over the applicant on Maori sovereignty grounds and assert that the applicant is himself sovereign and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the Courts. There is nothing in these documents that provides any support for the applicant’s assertions.  [5] Similar arguments have been rejected by this Court in earlier cases.5  [6] Nothing in the material provided to the Court by the applicant calls into question the legality of his detention. His application for leave to appeal is therefore dismissed.

EDITORIAL NOTE: NO SUPPRESSION APPLIED.  IN THE DISTRICT COURT   AT AUCKLAND   CRI-2016-004-009384   [2017] NZDC 26651   NEW ZEALAND POLICE   Prosecutor   v   SHAY OTIMI-STOWERS   Defendant   Hearing:  23 December 2016   Appearances:  S Gunn for the Prosecutor   M Gibson for the Defendant   Judgment:  23 December 2016    NOTES OF JUDGE E P PAUL ON SENTENCING  [1] Shay Otimi-Stowers appears today for sentence on charges of unlawfully getting into a motor vehicle, 11 burglaries and three attempted burglaries committed with a number of young persons. Mr Otimi-Stowers accepted a sentence indication from me on 9 November this year where I indicated an end sentence of two years  and two months’ imprisonment.  [2] I now have the pre-sentence report for Mr Otimi-Stowers. It records matters we already know, he is a young man, it records perhaps disappointingly, at least when interviewed he displayed little remorse for his actions and on assessment he is assessed as a high risk of future offending given the recidivist nature of the charges and his young age. The report writer recommends a short rehabilitation programme for Mr Otimi-Stowers and I agree with that. It is important he receives some form of intensive rehabilitation while serving his sentence of imprisonment. The report also  NEW ZEALAND POLICE v SHAY OTIMI-STOWERS [2017] NZDC 26651 [23 December 2016]  recommends special conditions; however that would only apply if the sentence was less than two years which it will not be.  [3] Concern was raised today via counsel that Mr Otimi-Stowers was of the understanding he would serve the whole sentence. As a Parole Board convenor, the only reason he would serve the whole sentence would be if he shows bad behaviour in prison and does not do his programmes. If Mr Otimi-Stowers shows good behaviour in prison and takes advantage of any programmes offered to him, that should stand him in good stead to be considered for parole and potentially early release but ultimately those matters are for the Parole Board when they see Mr Otimi-Stowers which I would expect the Parole Board would certainly see him within the first half of 2017 for parole to be considered.  [4] The circumstances and facts of the offending are contained in the sentence indication of 9 November and in that decision I traversed all relevant matters pertaining to sentencing. Accordingly, that sentencing indication is to be attached to these sentencing notes and forms part of the sentencing.  [5] There is nothing in the pre-sentence report or that I have heard today which would affect the sentence indication and accordingly on each of the burglary and attempted burglary charges, I impose a sentence of two years two months’ imprisonment. On the charge of failing to stop for police which is fine only, I convict and discharge. On the dangerous driving charge, I impose a sentence of two months’imprisonment, that will be concurrent with the two years two months and I impose a disqualification from holding or obtaining a driver’s licence for nine  months commencing from today. Likewise, on the unlawful taking charges, two years two months’imprisonment. Ido not fix release conditions, that is a matter for the Parole Board when parole comes to be considered.  [6] Mr Otimi-Stowers, that is your sentence. Stand down.  E P Paul District Court Judge  
NOTE: PUBLICATION OF NAME, ADDRESS, OCCUPATION OR IDENTIFYING PARTICULARS, OF COMPLAINANT PROHIBITED BY S 203 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT 2011.  IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC124/2016 [2016] NZSC 170   BETWEEN  CYRUS CHRISTIAN (AKAWILLIAM JOHN TASSELL) Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent    Court: Glazebrook, O'Regan and Ellen France JJ Counsel: N Levy forApplicant A Markham for Respondent Judgment: 21 December 2016  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A Leave to appeal is granted (Christian (aka Tassell) v R [2016] NZCA 450).  B The approved question is whether the Court of Appeal was correct to dismiss the conviction appeal.  REASONS  [1] Mr Christian was found guilty of three counts of sexual violation by rape. His appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed by the Court ofAppeal on 22 September 2016.1  Christian (aka Tassell) v R [2016] NZCA450 (Stevens,Asher and JosephWilliamsJJ).  CYRUS CHRISTIAN (AKAWILLIAM JOHNTASSELL) vR [2016] NZSC 170 [21 December 2016]  [2] He sought leave to appealto this Courton two issues:  (a)  Whetherthe Court ofAppeal was correct to hold that consent mustbe actively expressed; and   (b)  Whether the Court of Appeal was correct in its determination that the jury must have accepted the complainant’s evidence about lack of consent.    [3] The Crown accepted that the application for leave ought to be granted on the first issue but submitted that it should not be granted in relation to the second.  [4] We have granted leave in the terms we have because we do not consider the first proposed question can be properly examined outside of its factual context. The Crown can, however, renew its arguments about the second proposed issue at the hearing of the appeal.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent 
IN THE EMPLOYMENT COURT   AUCKLAND   [2016] NZEmpC 170   EMPC 263/2016   IN THE MATTER OF  a challenge to a determination of the   Employment RelationsAuthority   BETWEEN  GLOBAL COVER INSURANCES   LIMITED   Plaintiff   AND  MUSTAFABHAMJI   Defendant   Judgment:  20 December 2016    JUDGMENT OF CHIEF JUDGE G L COLGAN  [1] This challenge to a determination of the Employment Relations Authority was filed on 20 October 2016.1 The statement of claim failed to meet the minimum requirements of reg 11 of the Employment Court Regulations 2000 (the Regulations).  [2] The Court issued a Minute on 31 October 2016 requiring the plaintiff to file and serve an amended statement of claim in compliance with reg 11 of the Regulations within 21 days and, in the meantime, waived the usual requirement on the defendant to file and serve a statement of defence. The Court also advised the plaintiff to seek professional legal advice about its situation.  Because the Authority’s determination triggered the provisions of s 181 of the Employment Relations Act 2000 (the Act), I considered that Global Cover Insurances Ltd may not have participated in the Authority’s investigation of the matter in a manner that was designed to resolve the issues involved. Accordingly, I directed the production by the Authority of a s 181(2) report to the Court.  Bhamji v Global Cover Insurances Ltd [2016] NZERAAuckland 324.  [3] The plaintiff did not comply with the directions given in the Minute of 31 October 2016. By a further Minute issued on 30 November 2016, the Court gave the plaintiff a final period of 14 days within which to comply with those directions.  That Minute noted expressly that if the plaintiff had taken no step, the proceeding would then be dismissed for want of prosecution. The advice to the plaintiff about taking professional legal advice was reiterated.  [4] The Registrar has informed me that the plaintiff has taken no step. I am satisfied that the 31 October 2016 Minute was sent by email to the plaintiff’s Mr Naidu and that the 30 November 2016 Minute was sent byboth email and by courier to the plaintiff’s address for service on the statement of claim. There is a record that this courier deliveryhad been signed for.  [5] In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the defendant is not required to be burdened by the ongoing uncertainty of this litigation and, subject only to any submissions that the defendant may wish to make as to any costs incurred by him on the challenge, the proceedings are dismissed for want of prosecution.  [6] Acopyofthis judgment should also be sent to theAuthorityso that itknows that it needs to take no further steps in preparing its s 181 report to the Court.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  AUCKLAND REGISTRY   CIV-2012-404-0993   [2016] NZHC 3088   BETWEEN  VALERIE GEARD FAMILYTRUST   First Plaintiff   PAULINE JANICE HARRISON   Second Plaintiff   AND  GRAEME ROSS HARRISON   First Defendant   ADRIENNE HARRISON   Second Defendant    Hearing: 15 December 2016 Appearances: No appearance for Ms PJ Harrison Mr R Parmenter for Defendants Judgment: 15 December 2016  ORAL JUDGMENT OF ASSOCIATE JUDGE J P DOOGUE  VALERIE GEARD FAMILYTRUSTv HARRISON &ANOR [2016] NZHC 3088[15 December 2016]  [1] The defendants represented by Mr Parmenter seek first an order striking out the first plaintiff as a party in this proceeding. It would appear that Ms P J Harrison had intended to add as a plaintiff in this proceeding the trustees of the trust which is the subject of the litigation, the Valerie Geard Trust. It is Mr Parmenter’s submission for the defendants that Ms P J Harrison mistakenlyidentified that trust as the “Valerie Geard Family Trust” when she amended her proceedings to add a first plaintiff of that name. I agree, again, with Mr Parmenter that that is apparently what did happen. There does not appear to in fact be any such entity as the “Valerie Geard Family Trust”.  [2] Mr Parmenter further submits that the first and second defendant who are the sole trustees of the Valerie Geard Trust did not consent to their being added to the proceeding as first plaintiffs. Given those circumstances, Mr Parmenter submits that therehas been afailureto complywith r 4.56HCR. Mr Parmenter also refers to r 4.56(3) to the effect that no person may be added as a plaintiff without that persons consent.  I agree that there is noevidenceof any such consent in this case.  [3] I therefore consider that the order which the defendants seek ought to be made and there will be an order striking out the first plaintiff from the proceeding.  J.P. Doogue Associate Judge 
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND ROTORUA REGISTRY CRI-2015-063-731 [2016] NZHC 3051  THE QUEEN  v   JORDAN ALEXANDER CHRISTIAN  Charge: Theft Plea: Not Guilty Counsel: C H Macklin for Crown  M A Simpkins for Defendant Sentenced: 14 December 2016  SENTENCING NOTES OF BREWER J  Solicitors: Gordon Pilditch (Rotorua) for Crown Lance Lawson (Rotorua) for Defendant  R v CHRISTIAN [2016] NZHC 3051 [14 December 2016]  [1] Mr Christian, you are appearing today for sentencing on the conviction of theft of the Isuzu Elf motor vehicle.   [2] As you are well aware, the jury found you guilty of that charge and I entered a conviction. Subsequently, I wondered whether that was an appropriate conviction because you were charged as a s 66(1) party and it was not alleged that you had yourself physically stolen the Isuzu Elf. What was alleged was that Mr McDonnell had been in possession of the motor vehicle and that you were a party to its theft by Mr McDonnell, or by one of the others in the group. The principal evidence of that was that you were found in possession of the Elf.   [3] Of course, the jury acquitted all of your other co-defendants on the charge of theft of the Elf and so my view is that the conviction that should have been entered was on a charge of receiving the Elf knowing it to be stolen property.   [4] I do not have the power to change the conviction. The jury found you guilty of the charge, I entered a conviction, and now only the Court of Appeal can deal with the situation, if that is what you decide to do. What I will do, though, is sentence you on the basis that you received the Elf.  [5] My view is that, given the year-long period that you were on restrictive bail conditions and given the fact that you were remanded in custody for nearly seven weeks over the course of the trial, it would not be in the interests of justice to add any further penalty.  Accordingly, I discharge you now without further penalty so that in legal terms you have been convicted and discharged.  You may stand down.  Brewer J

The application is made pursuant to s 202 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 and is advanced on the basis that publication of these witnesses' names would be likely to cause them undue hardship.  [2] The application has been served on the defendant and on all media representatives who have expressed interest in the case. The application is not opposed. My reasons for granting the application can therefore be brief.  [3] Witness A is aged 94. He lives with his daughter, witness B. They live at the property where the victim was stabbed and they found her body lying in their garden soon after. Apart from the obvious trauma they will have suffered as a result of this tragic event, they have been subjected to considerable intrusion from members of the public stopping outside their property and peering in. They state that members of the public frequently stand outside their house and in their driveway pointing and staring at their house while they can be seen in their kitchen or working outside in their garden. They are concerned that if their names and address are published, this unwelcome and unreasonable invasion of their privacy will worsen considerably.  [4] 1 accept that the concerns expressed by these witnesses about the likely effects on them of having their names and address published are genuine and well­founded. This case has attracted considerable publicity and public interest. However, there is no legitimate public interest in knowing the identity of the witnesses who had the misfortune of living at the property where the victim died. am satisfied that these witnesses will suffer undue hardship if their identifying particulars are published. This is particularly so, given that witness A is elderly and witness B is caring for him in their home.  Result  [5] make an order pursuant to s 202 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 forbidding publication of the name, address or occupation of witness A and witness B.  MA Gilbert J

(b)  An order restraining both plaintiffs from continuing an application made by Mr Paterson to the Tenancy Tribunal, under application number 4057525, until after determination of an application already before this Court and for hearing on 10 February 2016.     [2] The application for the Tenancy Tribunal is scheduled for hearing at the Hastings District Court on 16 December 2016 at 3.20 pm.  [3] The application was filed for urgent determination. I received supporting documents for LCIL, a memorandum in response from Mr Grove who is acting for the first plaintiff (GLW) in this proceeding and for Mr Paterson in the Tenancy Tribunal proceeding, and a memorandum in reply for LCIL.  [4] As advised to both counsel in the minute of 13 December I anticipated that I would determine this application on the papers. There was no objection from either party.  Given the urgency, I have determined this on the papers.  [5] I am satisfied that the application should be dismissed and it is dismissed.  [6] My reasons will follow as circumstances permit.

The proceeding succeeded and the decision was quashed.  It is not appropriate to seek to divide up the case into arguments won or lost.  The second respondent does not identify any unsuccessful aspect that was hopeless or would have significantly affected the case had it not been argued.    [2] Costs apply on the normal basis.  The applicant is entitled to scale costs plus reasonable disbursements.  Costs are joint and several.  No evidence was presented that suggested the second respondent disagreed with the procedural approach of the Council to the consent application or sought a different approach.  In Court, it defended the process fully.  Had I been asked to apportion, it would have been a 50/50 split.      ____________________________  Simon France J    
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND CHRISTCHURCH REGISTRY CIV-2016-409-001173 [2016] NZHC 2995  IN THE ESTATE of Anthony Paul Flanagan, Deceased  Hearing:  12 December 2016 (On the papers)   Appearances:  C W Knowles for Applicants   Judgment:  12 December 2016    JUDGMENT OF DUNNINGHAM J  [1] On 8 June 2015, Anthony Paul Flanagan (the deceased), died from cancer.  His wife, Lynette Philippa Ford, explains in her affidavit evidence that, on 30 May 2015, a few days before his death, the deceased decided to prepare a new will. He typed the will himself and discussed the contents of it with her and each of his four children. The will left various specified personal effects along with a monetary bequest, to each of his four children, and the balance of his estate to his wife. It is this document which Ms Ford now seeks to have validated as the deceased’s last will because she believes it expresses his intentions as to how his estate should be distributed.  [2] Following his death the personal effects of the deceased were distributed in accordance with the 30 May 2015 document, and the four children signed the document acknowledging receipt of those items on 21 June 2015.  [3] Ms Ford now seeks an order from the Court granting probate of the 30 May 2015 document as a will even though it does not comply with the formalities  Estate of ANTHONY PAUL FLANAGAN [2016] NZHC 2995 [12 December 2016]  in the Wills Act 2007 as it is not signed or witnessed. Accompanying the application is the signed consent of each of the four children to the application being granted.  [4] Ms Ford also attests to the fact that enquiries have been made for the purposes of the Status of Children Act 1969 and there is no evidence that the deceased had any other children.   Decision  [5] The Wills Act 2007 provides that a document may be declared a valid will under s 14 if:  (a)  it appears to be a will;   (b)  it does not comply with s 11 (relating to formalities); and   (c)  the Court is satisfied that it expresses the deceased’s testamentary intentions.    [6] Having regard to the affidavit evidence of Ms Ford, it is clear that the document attached to the application and described as the last will and testament of Anthony Paul Flanagan does express the deceased’s testamentary intentions. As all persons who would be affected by this application have provided their consent to the application being granted, I am satisfied it is appropriate to do so.  [7] Accordingly, the application is granted in terms of the draft order accompanying the application.  Solicitors: Helmore Stewart, Rangiora

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Solicitors: Cooke Morris Quinn,Auckland  AQUATECHNICS vNORMAN TYREE [2016] NZHC 2942 [6 December 2016]  [1] In July this year, I issued a judgment granting the plaintiff an interim injunction and Ireserved costs pending receipt of memoranda as to costs.   [2] The plaintiff has now filed a memorandum, seeking increased costs. Nothing has been filed by the defendant.     Award of costs  [3] The plaintiff is entitled to costs. The question is whether I should award increased costs.   [4] Mr McBride says I should increase costs for two reasons. First, it is submitted that the plaintiff “should never have been put to the trouble of having to obtain interim orders”, sayingthat “the threat to destroya swimmingpool and park it outside the plaintiff’s showroom was an unreasonable stance for the first defendant to take.” However, the unreasonable conduct complained of, for costs purposes, must be in relation to the proceeding, and not before it was commenced. I decline to increase costs on this basis.   [5] The second reason for increasing costs, says Mr McBride, is that “[t]he plaintiff is prepared to resolve the dispute by way of a District Court proceeding, but the first defendant has ignored that offer.” Nothing more is said by Mr McBride about the terms of the offer, and there is no material provided to the Court to evidence the making of an offer, so I am unable to assess the reasonableness or otherwise of the first defendant having refused that offer.   [6] For thesereasons, I decline to award increased costs.   [7] The plaintiff is entitled to 2B costs, in the sum of $7,582 plus $200 in reasonable disbursements.   Paul Davison J  
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA276/2015 [2016] NZCA 579  BETWEEN  GARRYALBERT MUIR First Applicant   AND  PETER ARNOLD MAUDE Second Applicant   AND  COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE Respondent   Hearing:  23 September 2015   Court:  Harrison, Dobson and Gilbert JJ   Counsel:  First Applicant in person S J Leslie for Respondent   Judgment:  5 December 2016 at 10 am    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A  The application for recall by the first applicant is dismissed.   B  The  first  applicant is ordered  to  pay  costs  to  the respondent  on  an   application  for  recall  on  an  indemnity  basis  together  with  usual   disbursements.     REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Harrison J)  MUIR V MAUDE [2016] NZCA579[5December 2016]  [1] In its judgment first delivered on 8 December 2015 this Court dismissed an appeal by the first and second applicants,1 Garry Muir and Peter Maude, against a judgment of Faire J in the High Court striking out his application for judicial review against the Commissioner.2  [2] On 20 July 2016 the Supreme Court granted Mr Muir leave to appeal on two discrete questions.3 But on 26 August 2016 the Supreme Court declined Mr Muir’s application to amend his grounds of appeal, revoked its earlier decision and dismissed the appeal.4 On 7 November 2016 Mr Muir applied to this Court for an order recalling and reversing its judgment.5 In his submission this Court’s decision was wrong because it failed to consider issues raised in his pleadings, notice of appeal and written submissions.   [3] We agree with Ms Leslie for the Commissioner that this Court has no jurisdiction to recall its earlier judgment. That judgment has been the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court. Leave was granted but the appeal was dismissed.6 The merits of the Commissioner’s application to strike out Mr Muir’s application for judicial review have been finally determined by the Supreme Court. This Court is now functus officio.7 And we agree with Ms Leslie that, even if we did have jurisdiction to recall, Mr Muir’s grounds are unarguable.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY  CIV-2016-404-000228   [2016] NZHC 2913   BETWEEN  DEBORAH WAXMAN   Appellant   AND  MARK CROUCH   Respondent   Hearing:  On the papers    Appearances: W G C Templeton forAppellant TA Simmonds for Respondent  Judgment: 2 December 2016  JUDGMENT NO 2 OF PALMER J (Costs)  This judgment is delivered by me on 2 December 2016 at 3.00 pm pursuant to r 11.5 of the High Court Rules.  ..................................................... Registrar / Deputy Registrar  Counsel: WG CTempleton, Barrister,Auckland TASimmonds, Barrister,Auckland  WAXMAN v CROUCH NO. 2 –COSTS [2016] NZHC 2913 [2 December 2016]  [1] In myjudgment of29 August 2016 Ideclined the appeal in part and upheld it in part.1 I dismissed Ms Waxman’s appeal of the refusal to grant a harassment order but I quashed the award of indemnity costs against her and substituted an ordinary costs order. I indicated I was inclined to let costs of the appeal lie where they fell as the parties enjoyed a relatively equal measure of success but, if the parties could not agree, Igave leave to file memoranda.2 They did so.  [2] The appellant, Ms Deborah Waxman, says she succeeded in two of three grounds of appeal. Ms Waxman submits the judgment overlooked a document filed by Ms Waxman called “Points of Appeal” of 12 May 2016. A paragraph of that document suggested, contrary to her Notice of Appeal, she was not challenging the dismissal of her original application but only procedural unfairness issues and indemnity costs. Ms Waxman’s memorandum also, inappropriately and irrelevantly for the issue of costs, takes issue with aspects of the reasoning of the judgment. And it objects to part of the costs award I substituted for the District Court’s award of indemnity costs in upholding part of Ms Waxman’s appeal.  Ms Waxman seeks costs.  [3] The respondent, Mr Mark Crouch, submits Ms Waxman was unsuccessful in her substantive appeal, her Points of Appeal document does not say what she now says it does and the focus of her appeal was not what she now says it is. He submits he has incurred costs in opposing Ms Waxman’s appeal and seeks costs in his favour.  [4] The submissions of both parties confirm my original inclination that costs should lie where they fall for the appeal. Based on a realistic appraisal of the end result, I consider the parties enjoyed a relatively equal measure of success and failure.3 I decline to make the orders sought.

ORDER PROHIBITING PUBLICATION OF THE JUDGMENT AND ANY PART OF THE PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING THE RESULT) IN NEWS MEDIA OR ON THE INTERNET OR OTHER PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATABASE UNTIL FINAL DISPOSITION OF TRIAL. PUBLICATION IN LAW REPORT OR LAW DIGEST PERMITTED.  IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 132/2016 [2016] NZSC 156   BETWEEN  RHYS RICHARD NGAHIWIWARREN Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent    Court: Glazebrook, Arnold and Ellen France JJ Counsel: Applicant in person C J Hurd for respondent Judgment: 30 November 2016  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] Mr Warren faces two counts of attempted murder and five counts of using a firearm against a law enforcement officer.  [2] He seeks leave to appeal against a judgment of Brewer J of 7 October 2016,1 dismissing his protest against the court’s jurisdiction based on his status as tangata  R v Warren [2016] NZHC 2401.  RHYS RICHARD NGAHIWI WARREN v R [2016] NZSC 156[30 November 2016]  whenua Maori.2 He also complains that Brewer J wrongly entered not guilty pleas on his behalf at a callover on 15 June 2016.    Our assessment  [3] Taking the last point first, we accept the Crown’s submission that there is no detriment to MrWarren as he has the right to change his pleas of not guilty at any time under s 42 of the Criminal ProcedureAct 2011.3  [4] As to the protest to jurisdiction, we accept the Crown submission that similar arguments have been considered and rejected by the courts on numerous occasions.4 While we accept that this Court may in the future need to deal with issues relating to the criminal justice system and Maori, an individual protest to jurisdiction relating to particular criminal charges is not a suitable vehicle to do so.   Result  [5] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent  2 On the same day the Court of Appeal had rejected the same argument with regard to an appeal against a decision not to release Mr Warren on electronically monitored bail: Warren v R [2016] NZCA490 at [9]–[10].  3 This is not to suggest that Brewer J necessarily erred in entering the pleas. We note that a defendant who is required to plead under the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 and does not do so is deemed to have pleaded not guilty: s 41.  4 See for example R v Mitchell CA68/04, 23August 2004 and R v Miru CA651/01, 26 July 2001. The Court has also rejected applications for leave to appeal on similar arguments: see Wallace v R [2011] NZSC 10 and Wallace v R [2012] NZSC 54.

REASONS  [1] This is an application for bail pending the hearing of an appeal against conviction and sentence on 16 February 2017.  [2] Bail is discretionary, and the appellant must show on the balance of probabilities that it is in the interests of justice.1 The authorities establish that bail is exceptional.2  1 Section14ofthe Bail Act 2000. 2 Ellis v R [1998] 3 NZLR 555 (CA).  RALPH HEBERLEYNGATATALOVE vR [2016] NZCA564 [30 November 2016]  [3] I observe that:  (1)  it is not apparent to me that the prospects of a successful appeal against conviction are so strong as to favour bail,3 on either fitness or merits grounds;   (2)  nor is it apparent that thesentenceappeal is likelyto succeed;  and   (3)  so far as health and personal circumstances are concerned, I acknowledge the appellant’s numerous health issues. However, it appears that he is being appropriately cared for in the high dependency unit. The material supplied by the Crown in this regard is persuasive, Mr Krebs’criticisms notwithstanding.    [4] I have not been persuaded that it is in the interests of justice to grant bail pendingappeal.  The application is declined.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  AUCKLAND REGISTRY   CIV-2016-404-001019   [2016] NZHC 2790   BETWEEN  FLUJO HOLDINGS PTYLIMITED   Plaintiff   AND  MERISANT COMPANY   First Defendant   MERISANTAUSTRALIA PTY   LIMITED   Second Defendant   SUGAR AUSTRALIA PTYLIMITED   Third Defendant   NEW ZEALAND CANE SUGAR   COMPANYLIMITED   Fourth Defendant    Hearing: On the papers Judgment: 22 November 2016  JUDGMENT OF COURTNEY J  This judgment was delivered by CourtneyJ on22 November 2016 at 3.30pm pursuant to R 11.5 oftheHigh Court Rules  Registrar / DeputyRegistrar  Date………………………..  FLUJO HOLDINGS PTYLTD vMERISANTCOMPANY[2016] NZHC 2790 [22 November 2016]  [1] In my decision of 2 August 2016 I declined an application by the plaintiff, Flujo Holdings Pty Ltd, for interim relief in respect of the “Naturals” sweetener packaging being used by the defendants, whom I refer to collectively as Merisant.  Merisant seeks costs on the injunction application. Flujo resists and seeks to have costs reserved pending determination of the substantive proceedings.  [2] Rule 14.8 of the High Court Rules provides that, on an opposed interlocutory application, costs are to be fixed when the application is determined and payable when they are fixed, unless there are special reasons to the contrary. Flujo asserts that there are special reasons, namely that the balance of convenience was found to weigh in its favour and that the evidence did show that it had lost sales and that Merisant had “sailed deliberately close to the wind when re-designing their packaging.” Flujo’s perspective is that the outcome of the application reflected the inability of the Court to resolve conflicting evidence in the interlocutorycontext.  [3] Ido not accept that these are special reasons that justify reserving costs at this stage. In terms of the evidence, the problem for Flujo was not so much a conflict of evidence but an absence of evidence necessary to show confusion in the market as a result of Merisant’s product. It is true that the balance of convenience did favour Flujo. But given the lack of a substantial evidential foundation to show a serious question to be tried, that fact could not justify interim relief and nor does it justify departing from r 14.8.  [4] I do not, however, accept Merisant’s assertion that costs should be allowed on a combined 2B and 2C basis. The affidavit evidence was of a nature and extent ordinarily found in applications of this kind. There was no special urgency. The matter was argued on established legal principles. I consider that costs on a 2B basis which Merisant calculate at $7,379 is appropriate, together with disbursements of $160.  P Courtney J  
THERE IS AN INTERIM ORDER PROHIBITING PUBLICATION OF THE NAMES OF THE PARTIES AND ANY INFORMATION LEADING TO THE PARTIES' IDENTITY.  IN THE EMPLOYMENT COURT AUCKLAND [2016] NZEmpC 148 EMPC 282/2016  INTHE MATTER OF a compliance order AND IN THE MATTER a non-publication order BETWEEN ALA  Plaintiff AND ITE  Defendant Hearing: On the papers Counsel: M Ward-Johnson, for plaintiff Judgment: 15November 2016   INTERLOCUTORY JUDGMENT OF JUDGE CHRISTINA INGLIS  [1] The plaintiff has filed a statement of claim seeking orders relating to an alleged breach of a compliance order made by this Court. The claim arises out of, and is related to, earlier proceedings in which a compliance order was made against the defendant and in which permanent non-publication orders were made by the Court.1  [2] The plaintiff has applied for non-publication orders in this proceeding. The application has been advanced on a without notice basis. Mr Ward-Johnson has certified that the application complies with the applicable rules.  ITE v ALA [2016] NZEmpC 42.  ALAvITE NZEmpC AUCKLAND [2016] NZEmpC 148[15 November 2016]  [3] I am satisfied, based on the affidavit filed in support of the application, that serving notice of the application on the defendant would likely undermine the non-publication orders previously made by the Court, that there is a substantial risk that the plaintiff’s position in respect of non-publication would be prejudiced, and that it is in the interests of justice that the application be dealt with on a without notice basis.   [4] I am also satisfied that as well as non-publication orders, associated orders should be made preventing any person from searching the Court file without the prior leave of a Judge of this Court. Such orders are necessary, at least at this stage, to ensure the preservation of the Court’s original orders and to preserve the plaintiff’s position.    [5] The defendant is, however, entitled to be heard in respect of whether the orders made in this interlocutory judgment should continue or be set aside, and/or whether such orders ought to be made on a permanent basis.  [6] Accordingly, the following orders are made:  -An interim order prohibiting publication of the names and/or identifying details of either party to the plaintiff’s claim;  -An interim order preventing any person from searching the Court file, without the prior leave of a Judge of this Court.  [7] The interim orders identified in [6] will remain in place pending further order of the Court.     [8] Leave is reserved for either party to apply, on reasonable notice, for further directions or orders.  [9] No issue of costs arises.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY   CIV-2016-485-781   [2016] NZHC 2713   BETWEEN  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON   Applicant   AND  JUDICIAL CONDUCT   COMMISSIONER   Respondent   On the papers   Judgment:  11 November 2016    JUDGMENT OF CLARK J  [1] In his proceeding Mr Rabson seeks judicial review of a decision of the  Judicial Conduct Commissioner following a complaint lodged by Mr Rabson himself.  [2] Originally the proceeding named Justices of the Supreme Comi as second respondents. An application was made to have them removed as paiiies. The High Court, applying established principle, determined the Judges were not properly joined and accordingly they were struck out as parties. Costs were awarded to the parties struck out.  [3] In accordance with the Judge's direction a memorandum was filed in which the amount of costs sought is set out. Classifying the proceedings as category one proceedings of a straightforward natureI and the time allocations as being in band "A" requiring a comparatively small amount of time2 the calculation results in costs  of $888.00.  High Court Rule 14.3. High Court Rule 14.5.  RABSON v JUDICIAL CONDUCT COMMISSIONER [2016] NZHC 2713 [11 November 2016]  [4] The costs incurred, however, are $770.00. Because the costs incmTed are less than the scale calculation of costs an order is sought only for the costs incmTed.  [5] Accordingly, Mr Rabson is ordered to pay costs in the sum of $770.00.

B The approved questions are:  (i)  Was the approach taken in the lower courts to the valuation of the respondent’s practice correct?   (ii)  Was the amount awarded to the applicant under s 15 of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 correct?    (iii) Should the order that the Remuera properties be sold, rather than vested in the applicant, have been made?  SCOTT v WILLIAMS [2016] NZSC 149 [9 November 2016]  REASONS  [1] The approved questions are framed so as to permit the parties to advance all of the arguments foreshadowed in their respective applications for leave.  [2] The grant of leave does not indicate a final decision that the Court will deal with all of the issues raised in the applications for leave. Either party may advance arguments as to why any issue should not be determined on grounds of procedural fairness, inadequacy of evidential foundation or otherwise.  [3] We do not see the fact that the Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal on the halving and contingency discount issues in relation to s 15 of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 as precluding this Court from addressing those points.1 Section 7(b) of the Supreme Court Act 2003 precludes this Court from hearing and determining an appeal against a decision of the Court of Appeal refusing to give leave or special leave to appeal to that Court. It does not, however, preclude this Court from addressing an aspect of an issue arising from a substantive appeal decision of the Court of Appeal even though that aspect was not addressed by the Court of Appeal because leave to appeal on that aspect was refused by the Court of Appeal.  This does not qualify what we have said in [2] above, however.  Solicitors: Tompkins Wake, Hamilton for Applicant North Harbour Law, Auckland for Respondent  Scott v Williams [2015] NZCA 258.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar ……………………………………  Solicitors / Counsel: MrAMorahan, Barrister,Auckland MrASeton (appellant’sinstructing solicitor), Solicitor,Auckland  S vS [2016] NZHC 2591[31 October 2016]  [1] The appellant has appealed against a judgment of Judge BHS Neal in the FamilyCourt discharging temporaryorders made on 30 August 2016 in favour of the appellant against the respondent and described as “protection, occupation and ancillary furniture”.1 With the notice of appeal, filed on 28 October 2016, the appellant has applied without notice for an order for stay of the judgment.  [2] Having read the judgment under appeal, the affidavit of the appellant in support of the application for stay and counsel’s memorandum in support, I am satisfied that a temporary stay of the judgment should be ordered.  [3] There is an order that the interim orders made in favour of the appellant in the Family Court on 30 August 2016 remain in force pending further order of this Court. This order is made on the followingconditions:  (a)  The order is to be served forthwith on the respondent, together with a copy of this judgment.   (b)  The respondent mayapplyon three day’s notice to set the order aside.   (c)  Counsel for both parties are to file memoranda, without delay, addressing all relevant matters specified in schedule 6 to the High Court Rules for the purpose of expediting a hearing of the appeal.    [4] I am satisfied that an order for temporary stay is justified for two main reasons. First, the appellant has a reasonably arguable case that he is entitled to an order preventing the respondent from continuing to distribute emails, and other electronic information, as referred to in the judgment under appeal and in the appellant’s affidavit. Second, it is not apparent that any material prejudice would be caused to the respondent if the interim orders granted on 30 August 2016 remain in force with the respondent having a right to apply on notice to set the stay aside.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND INVERCARGILL REGISTRY CIV-2016-425-000111 [2016] NZHC 2584  BETWEEN BRIAN STANLEY KING Applicant AND LEANNE MARIE DIXON Respondent Hearing: On the papers Counsel: G L Wilkin for the Applicant Judgment: 28 October 2016  JUDGMENT OF NATION J  [1] Mr King has applied ex parte for an order charging the respondent’s interest in a property at 91 Howden Street, Te Anau with payment of $21,000 on an interim basis and until further order of the Court.  [2] The application has been made on an ex parte basis because of information referred to in Mr King’s affidavit that the property is the subject of an agreement for its sale, with settlement to take place on 31 October 2016.  [3] Mr King has provided evidence by way of affidavit that he lent Ms Dixon a total of $21,000, paid to her in instalments between 22 April 2015 and 24 June 2016. He says the payments were made pursuant to an oral agreement that the monies would be repaid to him on the sale of the property.  [4] Mr King says he learnt the property was on the market in August 2016. He has said that he has made repeated attempts since that month to obtain confirmation from Ms Dixon that she would repay the loan but there has been no response. There  KING v DIXON [2016] NZHC 2584 [28 October 2016]  was also no response to a letter to a similar affect sent to Ms Dixon by Mr King’s  solicitor and dated 16 September 2016.  [5] The High Court Rule 17.40 permits this Court to make a charging order on  Ms Dixon’s interest in the property being sold, charging her interest in the property  with payment of the amount for which Mr King may obtain judgment.  [6] Pursuant to r 17.41, the Court must be satisfied Ms Dixon is disposing of the  property with intent to act illegitimately and with intent to defeat Mr King’s interest  and entitlement to repayment of the loan.  A high standard of proof is required.1 That proof can be established by way of inference from available evidence.2  [7] The evidence does establish a strong prima facie case that Mr King is entitled  to repayment to him of $21,000 from the proceeds of sale of Ms Dixon’s property.  Her failure to respond to communications from both him and his solicitor do indicate that she is intending to sell the property without meeting what appear to be her obligations with regard to repayment of the loans which he has made to her.  [8] I am thus satisfied this is an appropriate case for a charging order to be made.  An order is accordingly made in terms of the draft order filed by the applicant’s  solicitors.  [9] Leave is reserved to the respondent to seek the variation or discharge of this order on three days’notice.

The application is not opposed by the plaintiffs.  [2] The draft statement of claim against Solutions Personnel Ltd and Blue Collar Ltd sets out a number of allegations relating to their asserted role in placing Mr Prasad and Ms Tulai with LSG, and the arrangements under which these placements are said to have occurred. A declaration that either one or both of the plaintiffs were party to a contract with Solutions Personnel Ltd is sought, together with a determination as to the nature of any such contractual relationship (employment or  KAMLESH PRASAD v LSG SKY CHEFS NEW ZEALAND LIMITED NZEmpC AUCKLAND [2016] NZEmpC 133 [26 October 2016]  contract for services). A declaration is also sought that Mr Prasad was party to an employment agreement with Blue Collar Ltd.   [3] The Court has the power to order that parties be joined under s 221(a) of the Employment Relations Act 2000. It provides that the Court may make such an order in order to enable it to more effectively dispose of any matter before it according to the substantial merits and equities of the case. 1 In the present case joining the proposed third parties will likely facilitate this end by enabling all disputes relating to the same subject matter (namely whether either or both of the plaintiffs were in an employment relationship at the relevant time and if so with whom) to be determined without the delay and expense of separate proceedings.  [4] In the circumstances leave is granted to issue the third party notice on Solutions Personnel Ltd and Blue Collar Ltd.  [5] No issue of costs arises.  Christina Inglis Judge  Judgment signed at 3.30 pm on 26 October 2016  The High Court Rules (Part 4, subpart 4) deals with the procedural steps applicable to third party applications.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND CHRISTCHURCH REGISTRY  CIV-2014-409-000866 [2016] NZHC 2521   UNDER  the Property Law Act 2007   BETWEEN  ALPINE SUN LIMITED Applicant   AND  HORTIVENTURE LIMITED Respondent   Judgment:  21 October 2016    JUDGMENT OF COLLINS [Costs]  Introduction   [1] On 8 September 2016, I struck out an application for early possession by Alpine Sun Ltd (Alpine). In doing so I awarded costs in favour of Hortiventure Ltd (Hortiventure) on a scale 2B basis.  [2] The parties returned to the Court to seek rulings in relation to aspects of the costs order which I made.  [3] I will deal succinctly with each of the issues.   Costs on costs  [4] Mr Summerlee, counsel for Hortiventure, asks for $892 for costs in relation to the costs memorandum.  [5] There is no absolute bar on costs. 1  Tyre Collection Services Ltd v Le Roy [2016] NZHC 898; TTAH Ltd v Koninklijke Ten Cate NV [2016] NZHC 761.  ALPINE SUN LIMITED v HORTIVENTURE LIMITED [2016) NZHC 2521 [21 October 2016)  [6] I can see no reason for costs to be awarded in relation to the costs memorandum in this case. The memorandum is appropriately brief. I am reluctant to award costs on a costs application in paii because it leads to an infinite spiralling loop ofcosts applications.   Bundle  [7] There 1s a dispute about who prepared the bundle for the strike-out application.  [8] Hortiventure says it prepared the common bundle.  [9] In my assessment, while Hortiventure may have taken some steps to prepare items that would go into a bundle, it seems that Alpine actually assembled the final version of the bundle, printed it and added in significant portions.  [1 O] In my assessment, at most, Hortiventure should get only one-quaiier of the costs for this step.   Opposition to early possession application and supporting affidavit  [11] Ms Meares, counsel for Alpine is correct when she says the proper award for a notice in opposition and supporting affidavit is $3,980 as per item 38 in the schedule. Hmiiventure is entitled to 75 per cent of $3,980 to reflect the fact that 25 per cent was awarded in the stay application.

         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  NELSON REGISTRY    CRI-2014-042-001861  [2016] NZHC 2358       THE QUEEN      v        JASWINDER SINGH SANGHA         Hearing     4 October 2016      Counsel:     J Davies for Department of Corrections   T C Lyall for J S Sangha       Judgment:     4 October 2016         ORAL JUDGMENT OF DOBSON J     [1] On 29 January 2016, I sentenced Mr Singh Sangha to 10 months’ home detention and 300 hours community work on convictions for immigration fraud.1   [2] Mr Stephen Taylor, his Probation Officer in Motueka, applied on 16 September 2016 to cancel the community work sentence and have it substituted with another available sentence.  That application is brought under s 68 of the Sentencing Act 2002, which provides the Court with power to vary or cancel a sentence of community work where there has been a change in circumstances that would justify doing so.    [3] Mr Singh Sangha has long-standing problems with his kidneys and they were apparent at the time of the trial and sentencing.  His chronic pain was one factor in my decision to commute what would have been a short term of imprisonment into one of home detention.      1  R v Sangha [2015] NZHC 37.   [4] At the end of March this year, Mr Singh Sangha had a kidney removed.  The level of on-going pain associated with its removal is at a level that prevents him doing the types of physical work involved in a community work sentence.  He has done only 32 of the 300 hours he was ordered to serve.  I am satisfied that the remaining 268 hours of community work should be cancelled.  The question is what substituted sentence should be imposed.  The remaining 268 hours is a significant component of the overall sentence and there should be another component to make up for it.     [5] Mr Taylor deposes that Mr Singh Sangha has been fully compliant with his sentence of home detention and I could extend that by a further two months.  This afternoon, Ms Lyall indicates that he has found that a difficult sentence and that is the approach that sentencing judges appreciate when home detention is substituted for what would otherwise be a term of imprisonment.     [6] The alternative is that Mr Singh Sangha has a limited capacity to pay a fine, if over a period of time.  There can be no mathematical formula for dollars fined per hour not completed of community work.  I have had regard to Mr Singh Sangha’s personal circumstances.  In addition, although it cannot directly be attributed to him, I have had regard to the clear impression I obtained by the end of the trial that significant amounts of money were involved in at least some parts of the immigration fraud to which he was a party.     [7] I consider a fine is the appropriate substitute sentence and I will impose a fine of $2,500.     [8] The outcome of the application is that I cancel the outstanding community work sentence and substitute a fine of $2,500.

The order was made following a plea of guilty being entered on 3 August 2016 by Mr Daniel Thomas, on a charge of operating a vehicle in an unauthorised street race.1  [2] Mr Thomas has not challenged the sentence imposed. Mr Hyde asserted that he was the owner of the vehicle. He appealed on the grounds that confiscation would cause “unduehardship” to him. That ground is availablebyvirtueof s 129(4) of the SentencingAct 2002.  [3] Mr Hyde did not appear in support of the appeal when it was called this morning. The Registrar contacted him. He does not intend to appear. He states that he no longer owns the vehicle.   [4] In any event, there is no evidence before the Court of undue hardship on MrHyde’s behalf. Thequestion ofwhether transfer of the vehicle willaffect any purchaser is something that will need to be considered in due course.   [5] For present purposes, the appeal is dismissed.

B The appeal against conviction by Isaac Mould is dismissed.  MCIVERv R; MOULD v R [2016] NZCA470[29 September 2016]   REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Courtney J)   Introduction  [1] In November 2015 Troy McIver and Isaac Mould stood trial with three others in the High Court at Christchurch on charges of sexual offending against a 16-year-old girl. Mr McIver and Mr Mould were each convicted on one charge of sexual violation by rape and now appeal their convictions. The other defendants were acquitted.  [2] The appellants assert a miscarriage of justice as a result of:  (a)  The Crown leading inadmissible propensity evidence in re-examination of the complainant about the alleged sexual violation of another girl by Mr Mould;   (b)  The Judge declaring a Crown witness, Nathan Mould (Isaac Mould’s brother), hostile;   (c)  The Judge refusing to allow Mr Mould’s trial counsel to cross-examine a witness called by Mr McIver on whether the complainant had previously accused that witness of rape.    [3] In addition, Mr Mould asserts that a miscarriage of justice resulted from evidence by the complainant’s mother of seeing him with an ankle bracelet.  [4] The Crown responds that no miscarriage of justice occurred: the propensity evidence was adequately met with a strong direction from the trial Judge; the Judge’s decision to declare Nathan Mould a hostile witness was justified; there was no basis for allowing evidence about a previous rape allegation by the complainant; and the evidence of the complainant’s mother about Mr Mould’s ankle bracelet was dealt with in a practical and effective manner, which avoided any unfair prejudice.   The offending  [5] The offending was said to have occurred after a bonfire beach party at Woodend Beach in Canterbury on 23 May 2014. Mr Mould (then aged 19) and his younger brother, Nathan Mould, asked the complainant if she wanted to go with them. Nathan Mould and the complainant were both 16 years old. Mr Mould, Nathan Mould and two friends of Mr Mould picked the complainant up from her home at about 7.00 pm. Mr Mould then bought liquor, including RTDs for his brother and the complainant.  [6] When they got to the beach the boys started the bonfire and the group sat around talking and drinking. Later others joined the group. These included MrMcIver and another man, neither of whom were known to the complainant. At some point in the evening there were minor incidents involving two of the defendants’ friends that made the complainant feel uncomfortable. These included one rubbing the complainant’s thigh and another responding to her request for a bite of his cheeseburger by saying that she could if she let him touch her breast. After these incidents the complainant asked Nathan Mould to walk her to the toilet block.  When they returned she sat on the other side of the fire. She decided not to drink anymore and lay down in front of the fire.  [7] The next thing the complainant remembered was being led into the sand dunes by Mr McIver and one of the other men. She did not want to go with them and said that she wanted to go back to the bonfire but theyignored her.  Theystarted tokissher.  Theywere then joined byMr Mould and two others. Nathan Mould was still at the bonfire, unaware of what was happening.  [8] The complainant found herself on the ground with Mr Mould on top of her. He raped her. She was screaming and trying to push him off. The other men were laughing and joking while this was happening. There was evidence that Mr McIver and another man were holding her down by the shoulders. Mr McIver then raped her.  [9] Eventually, Nathan Mould came to see what was happening. He saw MrMcIver on top of the complainant and shouted at himand pulled himoff. He then took the complainant back to the toilet block where he helped her to clean herself up.  [10] The defence case was that the complainant had consensual group sex with the men and regretted it later.    First ground of appeal: inadmissible propensity evidence about Mr Mould  Propensity evidence elicited inadvertently  [11] It was common ground that the complainant had spent time with Mr Mould after the night of the bonfire. Mr Mould relied heavily on the evidence about this contact to support his assertion that the earlier sexual activity had been consensual.  The complainant was cross-examined about a night approximately a month after the alleged rape when she went to Mr Mould’s house with a friend, B, and B’s boyfriend. The defence asserted that during the evening the complainant had, at one point, walked around partially naked inviting sex.  [12] Under cross-examination by Mr Greig, who was counsel for Mr Mould at trial, the complainant said that the group had got drunk together, she passed out and when she woke up B had been raped by Mr Mould. The assertion that Mr Mould had raped B was entirely unexpected and, clearly, inadmissible. There was no reference in either the complainant’s or B’s statements that could have alerted trial counsel to the risk of such an allegation being made. Mr Greig did not engage with it and continued his cross-examination. In answering other questions about that evening the complainant made three further references to the alleged rape of B.   MrGreig ignored these references too.  [13] In re-examination, however, the prosecutor referred to the allegation:  Okay. You also talked about that being the night as I understood you, that you said Isaac had raped [B] and you described the circumstances. Is that right?  [14] The prosecutor then mentioned another piece of evidence, about the complainant having written the acronym “BAE” on Mr Mould’s bedside table, and asked:  Q: Now it’s been suggested that the … “BAE” was you announcing that you were Isaac’s significant other, what do you have to say about that?  A: No, no, I call my dog “bae”.  Q: I see okay. Now you also in your evidence said that it was this night as I understood it that Isaac raped [B]. You’re nodding your head yes?  A: Yes but she didn’ttell me until she came back to my house.  Q: And when was that?  A: The next morning.  Application for mistrial  [15] Mr Greig applied for a mistrial on the basis that the allegation that Mr Mould had raped B was irrelevant and deliberately put before the jury in a manner that was highly prejudicial and could not be cured by a direction to the jury.  [16] The prosecutor resisted the application on the (inconsistent) grounds that (1) the issue had arisen from Mr Greig’s own cross-examination and could not be ignored; (2) her reference to it in re-examination had been for the purpose of accurately determining the timing of when the complainant had got drunk with MrMould so as to meet the suggestion that, contrary to what the complainant maintained, she had had contact with Mr Mould after finding out about him raping B; and (3) the application for a mistrial was tactical only.  [17] Whilst acknowledging that the evidence was irrelevant to the issues that the jury had to consider and might be seen as having some prejudicial effect on MrMould, Gendall J nevertheless did not consider it serious enough to declare a mistrial.1 He noted, too, that the allegation had arisen from Mr Greig’s own cross-examination two days previously with no issue being taken at that point. The  R v Mould [2015] NZHC 2842.  Judge considered that the matter could be appropriatelydealt with bya firm direction  to the jury.  [18] In summing up the Judge gave a very firm direction:  Members of the jury, there is one further specific direction I need to make to you at this point.  You may remember that when [the complainant] was being cross-examined, I think during the week before last, she said that [B], her friend, had told her that on the night of the drinking session at Isaac Mould’s house, which I think was the night when they all stayed the night, Isaac Mould had raped [B]. Then, later in Ms Orchard’s re-examination of [the complainant] you will have heard this was mentioned again. Now this evidence and these claims by [the complainant] of what [B] had told her is hearsay. Itisinadmissible asevidencein this trialandit is quite irrelevantto matters which are before you. You can have absolutely no idea about the truth or otherwise of this bare allegation. It is merely a completely unsubstantiated claim and is entirely irrelevant in this case and it would be unfair and plainly wrong to take this evidence into account here. So you are to put these claims in [the complainant’s] evidence as to what she had been told by [B] completely out of your minds. I direct you firmly that they are irrelevant here. And you must ignore them completely when you make your deliberations on the charges which are before you.  Appeal  [19] Mr Greig submitted that the way the prosecutor had referred to Mr Mould  raping B suggested that it was a fact rather than an allegation and was especially  damaging because it related to a witness that the jury had already heard giving  evidence. He characterised it as an entirely gratuitous effort to blacken Mr Mould’s  character by using evidence that had plainly been elicited inadvertently in  cross-examination.  [20] Mr Greig also emphasised that Mr Mould was found guilty by majority  verdict and submitted that the jury was sufficiently cautious of the complainant’s  evidence to make a request to re-visit it, which was refused.  We take this submission  to be a reference to the jury’s request to view the complainant’s second evidential  interview again. All defence counsel, including Mr Greig, opposed that course and  the Judge refused the request.2 We do not accept that the jury’s request necessarily  indicated caution over her evidence or even that it related to Mr Mould.  R v Mould [2015] NZHC 2953.  [21] The decision to re-introduce the allegation that Mr Mould had raped B was a very poor one. It inevitably carried a risk of prejudice to Mr Mould. Although we accept Mr Corlett QC’s submission for the Crown that the prosecutor was using it to orient the witness to the night on which other events that were to be re-examined had occurred, therewereother means bywhich that could havebeen done. However, the real issue is whether the prejudice to Mr Mould as a result of the evidence was remedied by the Judge’s direction. We are satisfied that it was. The Judge gave a particularly firm and explicit direction. Not only did he direct the jury that it should not take the evidence into account at all, but he gave clear reasons for his direction that would have been readily understood by the jury. This ground of appeal therefore fails.   Second ground of appeal: declaring Nathan Mould hostile  Nathan Mould’s evidence-in-chief  [22] Nathan Mould gave a statement to the police about the events of the relevant night, which included:  All the guys were around her, that’s Isaac, Ky and Mitch, Brook and Troy. I couldsee themkissingher. Ithinkit was either BrookorTroy. I’mnot sure which one was kissing her.  And later:  When I got closer and then I heard [the complainant] screaming. It was two decent loud screams. I went much quicker towards her. When I got to where she was I sawTroy on top of her and he was having sex with her.  …  I knew that they had had sex with [the complainant] and I thought she didn’t want it because of the screaming I heard from her. I had never heard screams like that before.  I knew something was wrong.  [23] When Nathan Mould gave evidence, however, he departed from these statements. He was asked whether he had difficulty recollecting or difficulty about the matters he needed to talk about that day and responded that he had difficulties with both. Asked if, in terms of recollection, it would help if he saw his statement, he answered affirmatively and, with the Judge’s permission, was provided with a typed copy of his statement to refresh his memory.  [24] Alittle later in his evidence-in-chiefthe notes of evidence again indicate that he was having difficulty. At one point there was the following exchange between him and the prosecutor:  Q: Is there anything that could be done to help you through this, to make this easier?  A: Not atthe moment sorry.  I just find this really difficult.  [25] After that the prosecutor went on to question Nathan Mould about what happened after he and the complainant came back from the toilets and she sat on the other side of the fire. He described seeing the complainant walking off with Brook Norris and TroyMcIver and said:  A: [The complainant] was kissing Brook and Troy after I’d come back from the toilet.  Q: She was kissing them or the other way around?  A: She was kissing them.  [26] Then Nathan Mould described staying at the bonfire and seeing Mr Mould and two others walking off towards where the complainant, Brook and Mr McIver had gone. He described one of the other men returning to the fire and asking whether he wanted to join them. They did not tell him what was happening.  Nathan Mould remained where he was for another few minutes and then walked over to where the rest of the group was. When asked whether he could hear or see anything as he went he said:  A: I heard a scream but I’m not sure what type of scream it was.  Q: You’re not surewhat type of scream it was?  A: No, no.  Q: One scream or more?  A: Was it twice I think.  Q: Now I want you to stop there. I know it’s not easy but remember you’re on your oath?  A: Yeah.  Q: And try and take yourself back there and describe thatscream to us?  A: It was either an enjoyment or distress I’m not sure.  Q: Enjoyment or distress?  A: Yeah.  Q: You’re not sure?  A: Yeah.  [27] Towards the end of this evidence-in-chief the prosecutor returned to the issue of the screams:  Q: Now I just want to go back a little bit. You said that you heard [the complainant]scream as you walked towards those dunes?  A: Yes.  Q: And when asked to describe those screams you said you couldn’t say whether they were screams of, how did you put it?  A: Enjoyment or — can’t remember the other word now. Enjoyment or distress.  Judge declares Nathan Mould hostile  [28] At that point the prosecutor sought a direction from the Judge to have Nathan Mould declared hostile.  [29] Section 4(1) of the Evidence Act 2006 defines “hostile” in relation to a witness as including that the witness:  … gives evidence that is inconsistent with a statement made by that witness in a manner that exhibits, or appears to exhibit, an intention to be unhelpful to the party who called the witness …  [30] Theapplication was opposed bydefencecounsel on the basisthat the witness had not shown any unwillingness to help in the evidence he provided to the Court and that the evidence he gave had been no more than a minor deviation from his earlier statements to the police.  [31] Gendall J declared Nathan Mould hostile, allowing him to be cross-examined on his earlier statement:3  … The evidence which [Nathan Mould] has given before this Court in relation to the two matters [the Crown] has raised, in my view, is evidence that is inconsistent with his earlier police statement in a manner that appears to exhibit an intention to be unhelpful to the Crown in this matter. In a sense, this is not entirely surprising, given the close relationship between the witness, Mr Nathan Mould, and the first named defendant, his brother, Mr Isaac Mould.  [32] Nathan Mould was subsequently cross-examined on the inconsistencies between his statements. He acknowledged his earlier statement to the police but did not accept that he had thought, even at the time of making it, that the complainant’s screams were necessarily screams of anguish and not screams of pleasure.  Appeal  [33] Mr Greig submitted that there was no basis on which to declare Nathan Mould hostile; in terms of who was kissing whom the earlier statement regarding kissing was ambiguous anyway and, in relation to the screams, even if they had been of pain, that was explained by the complainant’s own evidence when she described Mr McIver as having sand on his penis, so the nature of the scream did not assist the jury on the consent issue.  [34] Mr Corlett argued that, in assessing Nathan Mould’s evidence for the purposes of declaring him hostile the Judge was entitled to consider his evidence overall and that his evidence-in-chief was much more vague and inconclusive than his statement.  For example, he talked of the complainant having “walked off with … Brook and Troy” and of seeing Troy and the complainant “having sex”. These descriptions contrasted sharplywith his statement to the police that the men had been standing around the complainant kissing her and that he “knew something was wrong” from the screams that he heard.  [35] Whether a witness exhibits an intention to be unhelpful is very much an evaluation for the trial judge. Although the Judge’s ruling did not contain any  R v Mould [2015] NZHC 2841 at [8].  comment about Nathan Mould’s demeanour, it is implicit in his conclusion that the manner in which Nathan Mould gave his evidence had impressed the Judge as appearing to exhibit an intention to be unhelpful to the Crown. Such a conclusion is consistent with the transcript, which strongly suggests that Nathan Mould was finding the whole process of giving evidence against his brother very difficult. We are satisfied that the Judge’s assessment of the situation and decision to declare Nathan Mould hostile were correct.  This ground of appeal therefore fails.   Third ground of appeal: refusing permission to adduce evidence of a previous rape complaint  Mr Howells’ evidence  [36] Counsel for Mr McIver called as a witness Jac Howells, who knew all the defendants either as a friend or an acquaintance. He also knew the complainant. He gave evidence that the complainant initially told him that the sexual activity had been rape but a few days later retracted that and said that she had just been disgusted by having had sex with the men.   [37] During cross-examination the prosecutor sought to undermine Mr Howell’s veracity. She suggested to him that if the complainant were to retract her allegation she would be more likely to do so to her friends B and S, to whom she was closer, than to him. She also suggested that if his account of the complainant retracting the allegation of rape were true, he would have gone to the police with what he knew in order to assist his friends.  [38] Mr Greig cross-examined Mr Howells on the question of how close a relationship he had with the complainant, eliciting evidence that he had previously had sex with her:  Q:  In fact you went out with [the complainant] didn’t you?   A:  No.  I’ve never been in a relationship with her.   Q:  You weren’t in a relationship with her?   A:  No I’ve just, I had slept with her you know.    Application for permission under s 44 to question the witness regarding a previous  rape allegation  [39] On the basisof Mr Howells’evidence that hehad slept withthe complainant  Mr Greig sought permission to ask the witness whether the complainant had ever  accused him of rape. Mr Greig was aware that a private investigator had obtained a  statement from Mr Howells that included the following:  Q: At some stage, hasn’t [the complainant] suggested that you had raped her too?  A: Yes. She only said it to me, not to others to my knowledge. She’s just a psycho. On the times she has said that to me, she seems to have meant it.  We did have a sexual relationship.  [40] The questions that Mr Greig wanted to put to Mr Howells were:  Did you ever have a sexual relationship with [the complainant]? Was it consensual? Did she ever suggest it was otherwise?  Were you ever worried that she might allege to the police that you had raped her?  [41] Recognising that such a line of questioning would infringe s 44 of the  Evidence Act, Mr Greig sought permission from the Judge to question Mr Howells  for the purpose of responding to the prosecutor’s suggestion that if the complainant  had retracted the rape allegation against the defendants Mr Howells would have gone  to the police; if the complainant had previously accused Mr Howells of rape he  would have a verygood reason for not doing so.   [42] Section 44 provides that:  (1)  In a sexual case, no evidence can be given and no question can be put to a witness relating directly or indirectly to the sexual experience of the complainant with any person other than the defendant, except with the permission oftheJudge.   (2)  In a sexual case, no evidence can be given and no question can be put to a witness that relates directly or indirectly to the reputation of the complainantin sexualmatters.   (3)  In an application for permission under subsection (1) the Judge must not grant permission unless satisfied that the evidence or question is of such direct relevance to facts in issue in the proceeding, or the issue of the appropriate sentence, that it would be contrary to the interests ofjusticeto exclude it.    [43] Before determining the application the Judge proposed a voir dire in which he would put to the witness a single question prefaced by the instruction that he (the witness) could answer fully and honestly regardless of any instructions he had received before giving evidence.  Thequestion was to be “Whydid you not go to the police?” Depending on the answer the Judge would then confer further with counsel as to the next step. Mr Greig did not agree with the proposed course. Mr Hembrow, who was trial counsel for Mr McIver and had actually called the witness, did not express a view.  [44] A voir dire was conducted. The Judge explained to Mr Howells that, notwithstanding the instructions he had been given not to mention his previous sexual relationship with the complainant, he was free to answer the question the Judge was about to put to him.  There was the following exchange:  Q: … Why did you not go to the police when as you’ve given evidence already [the complainant] said to you that she had not been raped on that night of, I think it’s the 23rd of May 2014?  A: I’m not sure.  Q: I’m going to ask a supplementary question and it is this; did your decision not to go to the police have a connection with your previous sexual relationship with [the complainant]?  A: No.  Q: I’ll just repeat my first question again and you need to answer this as fully and as truthfully as you can, why did you not go to the police?  A: I’m not sure, I never thought about it, I didn’t really see it as a big thing at the time but obviously it is.  [45] At the conclusion of the voir dire Mr Greig renewed his request that he be allowed to question Mr Howells. The prosecutor opposed the request on the basis that the voir dire had not produced any evidence of a connection between the alleged complaint of rape by the complainant in the context of a relationship with MrHowells and the issue the jurywas considering.   [46] The Judge refused permission:  Given the answers to my questions which have come from Mr Howells I am of the view in this case that given that what I have suggested was really a  prelude as I see it to legitimately considering whether getting into issues of [the complainant’s] sexual experience and reputation were appropriate matters here and as I have said given the response from Mr Howells I am satisfied that issues regarding their sexual relationship are not relevant to the real issue which is at stake here so my ruling is that in terms of s 44 of the Evidence Act there is to be no questioning of this witness relating to his alleged sexual relationshipwith [the complainant].  Appeal  [47] MrGreigsubmitted that, given the fact that Mr Howells had been instructed not to mention the sexual relationship between him and the complainant, the Judge’s refusal to allow counsel to cross-examine him was unfair. We do not accept that submission. The Judge put an open-ended question to Mr Howells, having gone to some trouble to ensure that he knew he was not constrained by previous instructions not to mention the sexual relationship between him and the complainant. He repeated the question so as to make absolutely sure the witness understood what he was being asked.   [48] In our view, once Mr Howells answered the Judge’s question in the way he did, whether the complainant had previously accused him of rape ceased to have any relevance for the purpose then being advanced, namely to answer the prosecutor’s criticism of his failing to go to the police with information of the complainant’s retraction.  [49] Before us, however, Mr Greig proposed a different purpose for the evidence. He submitted that it was relevant to the complainant’s veracity because it showed a previous instance of her regretting consensual sex and later lying about it being consensual. The Judge was not asked to consider allowing the evidence to be adduced for this reason. Even if consideration had been given to this use of the evidence at the time, however, we are satisfied that permission should not and would not have been given to adduce it.   [50] The Supreme Court recently considered the admissibility of allegedly false prior complaints relied on to challenge a complainant’s veracity in Best v R.4 It confirmed that where the defence proposes to call evidence that the complainant has  4 Best v R [2016] NZSC 122.  previously made a false complaint of a sexual nature both ss 37 and 44 are engaged  so that the substantially helpful test under s 37 must be met and permission obtained  under s 44 before the allegedly false complaint can be canvassed before the jury.5  [51] The Court noted that the potentially relevant factors in the s 37 inquiry may  include any remoteness in time, similarity (or lack therefore) between the  allegations, the number of allegedly false prior complaints, the reason a complaint  did not proceed or was withdrawn, whether the complaint was taken to a person of  authorityand whether the prior complaint was fraudulent or malicious.6 On the issue  of determining the falsity of the allegation, the Court said:  [74] In line with the policy behind s 37 (including that behind the old collateral evidence rule), the substantial helpfulness of a previous allegedly false complaint will also depend on how clear it is that the previous complaint is false, how much evidence would need to be canvassed to decide whether the complaint is false and the likely outcome of the assessment of that evidence. The more evidence that would need to be called on the unrelated prior allegation and thus the extent of any ‘trial within a trial’ and the more uncertain the outcome of the deliberations on that evidence, the less likely the evidence is to be substantially helpfulin terms of s 37.  [52] TheSupreme Court then summarised the approach to be taken:  [75] Aruling on whether evidence ofa prior allegedlyfalse complaintis substantially helpful under s 37 will usually be required before it can be raised in evidence.  [76] Where s 44 is potentially engaged, the judge’s permission will always be required and there must be some evidential foundation that the prior complaint was in fact false before it can even be raised before the judge. If there is such an evidential foundation, the complainant should be asked (in the absence of the jury) to confirm whether or not the prior complaint was false. There would be no further examination and no cross-examination unless and until the judge has made a ruling on ss 37 and 44.  [77] The judge will need to consider whether the evidence of the prior allegedly false complaint is substantially helpful under s 37 in the particular circumstances of the case. This will include consideration of all relevant factors, including the policy behind the old collateral evidence rule. The more evidence that would need to be called on the unrelated prior allegation and the more uncertain the outcome of the deliberations on that evidence, the less likely the evidence is to be substantially helpful to assessing a person’s veracity.  5 Best v R, above n4, at [71]. 6 At [73].  [78] If the substantially helpfulness test under s 37 is met, there will need to be a separate assessment of whether it would be contrary to the interests of justice to exclude the evidence. Even if that test is met s 44 (if it applies) may well limit the way the evidence is led so that the concentration is on the falsehood ofthe complaint and not the prior sexual experience.  (footnotes omitted)  [53] In the present case MrHowells’assertion of previousfalse complaints bythe complainant clearly engaged both ss 37 and 44. But even if the complainant were to admit making some or all of the allegedly false complaints (in his statement to the private investigator Mr Howells used the plural but did not specify how many) the circumstances Mr Howells described were so different from the charges being considered that the evidence would not have been substantially helpful. Mr Howells described complaints made only to him in the context of sexual activity only between him and the complainant, who were both 16 at the time. The circumstances were entirely different from the assertion of non-consensual sex between the complaint and a group of older men (the appellants were both 19 at the time) that resulted in complaints being made to the complainant’s friends and family and to the police. Alternatively, if the complainant denied making the complaints at all or denied that it they were false, the need for the jury to first determine those questions would significantly detract from any assistance to be had from the evidence.  [54] This ground of appeal fails.   Fourth ground of appeal: evidence that Isaac Mould wore an ankle bracelet  [55] When the complainant’s mother gave evidence she was asked about whether she knew Mr Mould. In answering, she referred to the fact that he had been wearing an ankle bracelet.  The evidence was this:  Q: And just going back to the Mould boys who lived down the road, how long had you known Nathan Mould as at the beginning of last year?  A: Probably since the beginning of 2013.  Q: And what abouthis older brother Isaac?  A: UmI didn’t know him well, he was wearing an ankle bracelet.  [56] The words “he was wearing an ankle bracelet” do not, however, appear in the transcript. At Mr Greig’s suggestion and with the agreement of all counsel and the Judge they were removed in the hope that the jury would not have understood the significance of the evidence and would not find it in the transcript in the event that they reread the passage.  [57] Mr Greig submitted that the evidence nevertheless prejudiced Mr Mould because it conveyed that Mr Mould was either serving an electronically-monitored sentence or was on electronically-monitored bail. He argued that it is not open to counsel to consent to his or her client being prejudiced. Mr Greig added that, given the Judge’s refusal to declare a mistrial following the complainant’s evidence about Mr Mould having raped B, there was little prospect of a mistrial being granted as a result of this evidence and no point in making an application.  [58] In Edmonds v R this Court referred to the well settled legal principles that apply where there has been inadvertent disclosure of prejudicial information about an accused during the trial; the trial judge has a discretion to discharge the jury but whether it is proper to do so depends on the facts of the particular case.7 The Court went on to note that inadvertent disclosure of the imprisonment of a defendant is not of itself sufficient reason to conclude that there might have been a miscarriage of justice.8  [59] In this case we are satisfied that the evidence did not cause any or unfair prejudice. The evidence was fleeting, was not referred to again by any counsel, and was deleted from the record. These steps, coupled with the usual direction during summing up regarding unfair prejudice would have been an effective counter to any risk of the jury drawing an adverse inference as to Mr Mould’s background.  7 Edmonds v R [2015] NZCA152 at [23], citing R v McLean (Colin) [2001] 3 NZLR 794 (CA) at [14].  8 Edmonds v R at [24].   Result  [60] None of the grounds of appeal have merit. Both appeals against conviction are dismissed.  Solicitors: Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent

[4] In my judgment of 7 July 2016, I said Ms Lister would need to take up, separately, any issue of the second respondent receiving rental income for her father’s property during his lifetime.2 But argument over costs in this case is not the time or place to do that. I suggest the respondents respond to Ms Lister’s concerns to her directly.  [5] I award costs to the first and second respondents as sought in paragraph [2].

Her grounds of appeal are based on the same misconceptions as before. On 4 August 2016 she apparently attempted to filein the High Court a Notice of Appeal which was rejected since an application for leave to appeal is required. On 29 August 2016 she filed an application for leave to appeal. That is well outside the 20 working days she was allowed by r 20.3 of the High Court Rules to file such an application.

I do not need to be starting to look at issues relating to supervision.  You are well able to and you come from a sufficiently disciplined background to enable the issues you have to be confronted, treated and assessed; I am not going to do that.  There are people who do not have the opportunities that are available to you that need the help from the services that are stretched to the utmost trying to provide them.  I am not going to put you on supervision.     [2] The issue is do I give you community detention?  I understand (and I could have this totally wrong though) that you intend to leave Otago, which has this drinking culture, and do your studies in either Auckland or Waikato.  That is   a decision for you but that causes difficulties about community detention and having any ability to control or have input into how you are going with treatment programmes and plan.  Somewhat against what I would normally do in the circumstances that confront me here, I am going to deal with you by the imposition of community work.  It will be a large amount of community work but I temper that also with making a large emotional harm reparation payment to Ms Kane (Policewoman Kane) because I consider that you can spend your summer working to get the emotional harm reparation together so that she has some refund of the emotional trauma and the rocky road she has been through over the past 18 months.     [3] On the charge of assault with intent to obstruct, you are sentenced to 300 hours’ community work.  You will pay emotional harm reparation of $5000.  You will pay that by 31 December this year.   [4] On the charge of assaulting Mr Ogilvie, Mr Ogilvie is a very honest man.  He said in his victim impact statement that he had not suffered emotional trauma.  I cannot award him emotional harm reparation.  You are sentenced to 100 hours’ community work to be done concurrently.   [5] On the intentional damage, you have paid the reparation I am told.  You are sentenced to 60 hours’ community work; to be dealt with concurrently.   [6] On the resisting Constable Early, you are sentenced to 60 hours’ community work; to be served concurrently.          K J Phillips  District Court Judge

    IN THE DISTRICT COURT  AT AUCKLAND    CRI-2015-004-011283    [2016] NZDC 17794       NEW ZEALAND CUSTOMS SERVICE    Prosecutor    v        FEDERATION CLOTHING LIMITED  PUBLIC GALLERY LIMITED  ONLY FOUND YOU LIMITED  Defendants           Hearing:     9 September 2016      Appearances:     J Blythe for the Prosecutor  H Ford for the Liquidators      Judgment:     9 September 2016         NOTES OF JUDGE C J FIELD ON SENTENCING     [1] The defendant companies face nine charges in relation to breaches of the Customs and Excise Act 1996. The companies are Public Gallery Limited, Federation Clothing Limited and Only Found You Limited.   [2] The companies are in the hands of the liquidator at the moment and a plea of not guilty was initially entered.  The liquidators are not wishing to have pleas of guilty formally entered.  This then is set down as a formal proof and the liquidators are represented by Mrs Ford, the informant by Ms Blythe.   [3] I have read the memorandum regarding the issues for trial.  As I have indicated, the companies face multiple charges under the Customs and Excise Act and the representatives of the company, Ms Joblin and Mr Clegg, have also been   charged personally, pleaded guilty and have been fined for their role in the offending.  The prosecutor relies on the formal written statements of witnesses, pursuant to s 18 Evidence Act 2006 and I accept the written statements accordingly.   [4] The evidence relied upon is attached at tab 4 of the submissions, relating to erroneous entries in relation to clothing imported from China by the defendant companies and another company by the name of Minti Design Limited between December 2010 and February 2014.  Ms Joblin and Mr Clegg, to whom I have already referred, were directors of all four companies.   [5] An analysis of the individual charges and the maximum penalties attaching to each have been referred to under tab 4, together with the draft summary of facts.  It is a lengthy document and I do not intend to read it in its entirety other than to note that, as a result of the investigation, Customs have identified 114 erroneous import entries submitted and two imports that had no entries lodged as the invoices were undervalued.  The imports were undervalued by $2,830,394.59 and as a result the total revenue evasion by the companies is $680,120.48.   [6] I have read Mr Thompson’s formal statement which forms the basis of the evidence upon which the informant relies and I accept his statement and analysis as being correct and reliable.   [7] In all the circumstances then and having regard to the other statements lodged, I am satisfied that the charges have been made out by way of formal proof and the companies are convicted accordingly.   [8] Now this will need to be adjourned for sentencing on the basis that there are still outstanding issues concerning possible forfeiture applications and other matters to be tidied up.  It seems to me that that could be done by any Judge, given that liability has been established and the only issue now outstanding is one of penalty.  However, that remains to be seen.

REASONS  [1] The applicant, Mr Justo, wishes to appeal a judgment of Simon France J in the High Court at Nelson dated 30 June 2016.1 The last day for bringing the appeal within the time frames stipulated by r 29 of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005 was 28 July 2016. Mr Justo’s lawyers duly filed a notice of appeal in this Court on 28 July 2016, but failed to serve it on the respondent. That was not actioned until 1August 2016.  Justo v Briggs [2016] NZHC 1464.  JUSTO vBRIGGS [2016] NZCA  [2] The failure to serve the appeal on the respondent by 28 July 2016 means MrJusto is now required to seek an extension of time under r 29Ain order to be able to proceed with his appeal.  [3] The respondent initially opposed an extension of time being granted, but has changed his mind and now consents.  [4] I am satisfied the matter may be dealt with on the papers and that in the circumstances the application should be granted. The delay was very short; it has not caused the respondent any prejudice; and it was due to an oversight on the part of Mr Justo’s legal representatives.  [5] The application for an extension of time in which to appeal is dulygranted.  [6] There is no order as to costs.

Registrar/Deputy Registrar  8· 9 /6  Date .............. .  Susan Knowles  Oepuiy Registrar High Court Auckland  R vFILO [2016] NZTIC2128 [8 September2016J  [!] In a judgment delivered on 6 April 2016, Fogarty J made a finding under s 9 of the Criminal Procedure (Mentally Impaired Persons) Act 2003 (the Act). 1 He found that Mr Filo had committed the physical act giving rise to the charge of murder.  [2] The Judge did not consider it necessary to make similar findings in relation to the remaining charges that Mr Filo faces. Counsel agree that it is necessary for a finding to be made under s 9 in respect of all charges, because it is not possible to severe a single charge from the remaining charges for the purposes of the Act.  [3] There is no dispute that on the balance of probabilities Mr Filo committed the physical acts underpinning each of the other charges. I therefore record my finding under s 9 of the Act to that effect.  [4] I make an order prohibiting publication of the judgment and any part of the proceedings (including the result) in news media or on the internet or other publicly available database until final disposition of trial.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY  CIV-2016-404-000538 [2016] NZHC 2117   BETWEEN  PENELOPE MARYBRIGHT Appellant   AND  AUCKLAND COUNCIL Respondent   Hearing:  (On the papers)   Counsel:  Appellant in Person    K F Quinn for Respondent Judgment: 7 September 2016  COSTS JUDGMENT OF VENNING J  This judgment was delivered by me on 7 September 2016 at 3.00 pm, pursuant to Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules.  Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Date……………  Solicitors: AucklandCouncil, Auckland Copyto: Appellant  BRIGHTvAUCKLAND COUNCIL[2016] NZHC 2117[7 September 2016]  [1] In ajudgment delivered on 11 July2016 the Court granted leaveto Ms Bright to bring the appeal out of time but dismissed her appeal. As to costs the Court recorded:1  [30] The Council is entitled to costs. Costs should be on a 2B basis subject only to the Council’s counsel filing a memorandum to confirm that the costs on a 2B basis do not exceed the actual costs incurred by Council on this appeal.  [2] Counsel for the Council has filed a memorandum to confirm that costs on a 2B basis amount to $12,822.50 but that the Council’s lawyers charge-out rate applied to the estimated time spent preparing for the appeal of 40 hours results in sum of $7,080.00. That is the sum the Council seeks byway of costs award.   [3] High Court Rule 14.2(f) provides:  an award of costs should not exceed the costs incurred by the party claiming costs.  [4] The fact the Council was represented by in-house counsel does not prevent it from recovering its costs. In Henderson Borough Council v Auckland Regional Authority Cook J noted:2  [t]he fact that an employed practitioner has acted for the successful party is not a sufficient reason for denying that party an award of party and party costs: after all, the time of a salaried employee has been occupied.  [5] While that case was decided before the new costs regime, cases decided under the Part 14 of the High Court Rules apply the same principle.3  [6] The sum of costs sought by the Council of $7,080.00 is approved. The Registrar may seal the costs order in that sum.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2016-485-449 [2016] NZHC 2075  IN THE MATTER of an appeal against a determination ofthe Tenancy Tribunal  BETWEEN JENNIFER ANNE FRANICEVIC Appellant  AND KGHTRUST Respondent  Hearing: 24 August 2016  Appearances: Appellant in person P J Kennedy and A J Green for Respondent  Judgment: 2 September 2016  JUDGMENT OF WILLIAMS J  [1] Ms Franicevic has an appeal to this Court against the decision of the District Court upholding the decision of the Tenancy Tribunal. Pending the appeal, she applied for a stay of the District Court decision.  [2] On 28 June, I heard the application and declined to grant the stay. She then applied for leave to appeal the stay decision to the Court of Appeal. I heard the application on 24 August. An interlocutory decision made by the High Court on appeal from a District Court decision is an original decision, and accordingly, is appealable as of right. 1 Accordingly, the High Court's leave is not required, and must be declined accordingly.  [3] One other point to note is that in my earlier judgment, I found that the merits of the substantive appeal were slim because no question of law was disclosed.  Siemer v Heron [201 l] NZSC 133, [2012] NZLR 309 at [31] and [34].  FRANICEVIC v KGH TRUST [2016] NZHC 2075 [2 September 2016]  incorrectly stated that there is no right of cross-examination in the Tenancy Tribunal. As it transpires, s 93 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1993 does provide such a right. However, Ms Franicevic did not ask to cross-examine in the Tribunal. Accordingly, this does not change my earlier analysis that the merits of the appeal are slim, and that, accordingly, the merits of the stay application are not strong. And none of the other grounds raises a question of law.  _JI lvi_---.(_  Williams J  
IN THE EMPLOYMENT COURT WELLINGTON [2016] NZEmpC 114 EMPC 142/2016  IN THE MATTER OF  a challenge to a determination of the   Employment Relations Authority   BETWEEN  HUTT CITY VETERINARY CARE   LIMITED   Plaintiff    AND CECILIA BARR Defendant Hearing: (by liquidators' memorandum filed on 26 August 2016) Representation: K Francis, counsel for the liquidator G Ogilvie, advocate for the defendant Judgment: 2 September 2016  JUDGMENT OF JUDGE K G SMITH  [1] The plaintiff was placed in liquidation on 26 July 2016.  [2] On 23 June 2016, Chief Judge Colgan issued a minute to the plaintiff containing directions about the proceeding. The plaintiff was informed that its statement of claim did not comply with reg 11 of the Employment Court Regulations 2000 (the Regulations) and it was directed to file and serve a compliant statement of claim within 21 days. The defendant was relieved of an obligation to file a statement of defence until and unless an amended pleading was filed. In the same minute the plaintiff was urged to take legal advice and was made aware that non-compliance  with the Court’s directions may result in its claim being dismissed.   [3] On 29 July 2016, Chief Judge Colgan issued a further minute recording advice received from the Registrar about the plaintiff being placed in liquidation as has previously been noted.   HUTT CITY VETERINARY CARE LIMITED v CECILIA BARR NZEmpC WELLINGTON [2016] NZEmpC 114 [2 September 2016]  [4] On 24 August 2016, a further minute was issued by me to the liquidators (with a copy to the defendant) seeking a report about the liquidation and the  liquidators’ intentions, particularly as to whether the litigation might be disclaimed  by the liquidators under s 269 of the Companies Act 1993.   [5] The liquidators have now filed a very prompt report confirming that the plaintiff has been placed in liquidation and that they have disclaimed the plaintiff’s claim in the proceeding as onerous property under s 269 of the Companies Act 1993.  The liquidators also advised that the defendant has filed a creditors’ claim in the  liquidation and that claim would be considered and assessed in due course.  [6] In the circumstances described by the liquidators, it is clear that the proceeding will not be amended, nor will it proceed to trial.  [7] I consider the only appropriate course is to dismiss the proceeding and order accordingly.    [8] Given that the plaintiff is in liquidation and the defendant has not been required to take any steps in this proceeding there is no order for costs.

BEFORE THE ENVIRONMENT COURT  IN THE MATTER  BETWEEN  AND  Court: Environment Judge C J Thompson Environment Commissioner S K Prime Decision No [2016] NZEnvC  ENV-2015-AKL-000116  of an appeal under s120 of the Resource Management Act 1991  ODDFELLOWS HOLDINGS LIMITED  Applicant  AUCKLAND COUNCIL Respondent   Environment Commissioner I A Buchanan   CORRECTION TO DECISION  Decision issued: 31AUG 2016 [1] In the Court's decision issued on 23 August 2016 (Decision [2016] NZEnvC 158), at paragraph [11] the Court recorded that:   The trading hours are now proposed to be:  •  Monday to Saturday, 8 am to 4 pm;   •  Sunday and public holidays -9 am to 4 pm. Staff preparation and cleanup times are proposed to be:   •  Monday to Saturday, 7.30 am to 5 pm;   •  Sunday and public holidays, 8.30 am to 5 pm.    [2] In concluding the decision, we recorded at paragraph [59] that we were satisfied that the proposal could be given consent on the basis of the conditions proposed in Mr Bartlett's Memorandum of 8 August 2016.  [3] It has now being drawn to our attention that the hours actually proposed in that Memorandum were not as we had recorded, but were proposed to be 7 am to 4 pm, Monday to Friday and 8 am to 5 pm on Sunday and public holidays; with staff preparation times an hour on either side of those times.  [4] In terms of amenity effects, this still compares favourably with the trading hours originally proposed, of 6.30am to 6.00pm.  [5] When this error was drawn to our attention, the Members of the Court conferred and agreed that the longer hours actually proposed in Mr Bartlett's Memorandum do not change our views on the consentability of the proposal and we would be content to grant consent on that basis, particularly given that the outdoor seating part of the proposal, which seemed to be of particular concern, was no longer sought.  [6] The purpose of this decision is to advise of the correct position and to apologise for the error.

The prope1iy was formerly owned by the defendants jointly. The first defendant, Ms McCartney, has pleaded guilty to charges of defrauding the third plaintiff. The prope1iy was recently transferred into the name of the second defendant alone.  [2] In terms of Part 32, I am satisfied that it is in order for a freezing order to be made on the terms sought by the plaintiffs. In terms of HR 32.7 the duration of the freezing order will be limited to 19 September 2016. On that date, there will be a  THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION v MCCARTNEY [2016] NZHC 2057 [31 August 2016]  hearing at 9.00 am (one hour allowed) for the applicant to satisfy the Cami that the freezing order could be continued or renewed. The defendants are to be advised that, on that date, they will have an opp01iunity to be heard by the Cami. A hearing by AVL may be appropriate.  [3] I make orders accordingly.

A memorandum has been filed by Mr Locke who formerly had been instructed as counsel for the appellant. Mr Locke advised that he and his instructing solicitors have been without instructions for some time and accordingly he was not in a position to make any submissions.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  [2016] NZCA 409  BETWEEN  ALISTER JOHN MARSH Applicant   AND  ACCIDENT COMPENSATION CORPORATION Respondent   Counsel:  Applicant in person   Judgment:  26 August 2016 at 4.00 pm    (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OFFRENCH J (Review of Registrar’s Decision)  The Registrar’s decision refusing to accept for filing notice of application for special leave to appeal dated 9 August 2016 is upheld.  REASONS  [1] Mr Marsh seeks a review of a Registrar’s decision refusing to accept for filing his application for special leave to appeal dated 9 August 2016.  [2] The decision that Mr Marsh wants special leave to appeal is a decision of Mander J in the High Court at Christchurch.1 In that decision Mander J declined MrMarsh leave to bring a High Court appeal against a substantive decision of Judge Barber in the Wellington District Court under s 162 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001.2  1 Marsh v Accident Compensation Corporation [2015] NZHC 3208. 2 Marsh v Accident Compensation Corporation [2012] NZACC 115.  MARSH vACCIDENTCOMPENSATION CORP[2016] NZCA409[26August 2016]  [3] It is well established that this Court has no jurisdiction under s 163 of the Accident Compensation Act to hear an appeal against a High Court decision declining leave to appeal to that Court.3  [4] This Court having no jurisdiction, the Registrar was correct to refuse to accept Mr Marsh’s application for filing.  I therefore uphold the Registrar’s decision.

    IN THE DISTRICT COURT  AT NAPIER    CRI-2014-041-002172    [2016] NZDC 16602       THE QUEEN        v        ROBERT DONALD WAIKATO           Hearing:     26 August 2016      Appearances:     J Rielly for the Crown  S Jefferson for the Defendant      Judgment:     26 August 2016         NOTES OF JUDGE G A REA ON SENTENCING      [1] Mr Waikato, you are finally here for sentence today on nine burglaries and two driving charges.   [2] The burglaries involved losses of over $50,000 and they come at a time when you as a mature man have ample previous convictions for the same thing.  The reason why the matter has taken so long to get dealt with is because of your health issues.  You have a disease that has caused major difficulties for you and the sentencing was originally put off for some months after your plea because of that.     [3] However, the time has come where the Court simply has to impose a sentence at this stage.  It may well be that as a result of this sentence you are able to make application to the Parole Board under the Parole Act 2002 for compassionate release or for some other consideration but that will be a matter for you, Mr Jefferson and the Parole Board.   [4] I do not consider it is necessary to go through all of the details of the charges.  Originally Judge Adeane gave a sentence indication of a starting point of six years’ imprisonment.  The Crown accept that because you have not been convicted of all of the charges included in that sentence indication a reduced starting point can be arrived at.     [5] Accordingly in relation to each of these charges when looked at in their entirety, I think the appropriate starting point is one of five years’ imprisonment.  There does need to be an uplift to reflect the fact that you have multiple previous similar convictions and that is set at six months.  I consider that that five year and six months as a starting point needs to be reduced down to four years to reflect your current health situation and the difficulty that serving any sentence would represent for you.     [6] You are entitled to a discount of 15 percent in relation to your late pleas of guilty and therefore on the burglary charges you are sentenced to three years and three months’ imprisonment on each charge.  The terms are concurrent, running together, making a total of three years and three months.     [7] On the failing to stop you are convicted and discharged.  On the driving while suspended you are sentenced to one months’ imprisonment.  The terms of imprisonment are concurrent, running together, making a total of three years and three months.  You are disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver’s licence for a period of one year and that starts today.   [8] For completeness, so that anybody looking at this at a later time understands the basis upon which you were sentenced, I direct that the comprehensive summary of facts be annexed to these sentencing notes.  It is not necessary in my view at this stage for me to go through them in any more detail.         G A Rea  District Court Judge

B Costs are reserved.  REASONS  [1] Although, apart from as set down at [2] below, the Court does not restrict the arguments that can be made, the Court is particularly interested in submissions on s 6 of the Smoke-free Environments Act 1990 and expects focused argument from counsel on this aspect.  [2] Theapplicant also sought leaveto challengethe Court ofAppeal’s decision to reduce the hearing time for the appeal in that Court. This is a procedural matter related to the particular circumstances of this case and does not meet the criteria for leave to this Court. Theapplication for leave to appeal is refused on this point.

One of the agreed terms was that the Court would make a compliance order if there was a breach of the payment obligations.  JUDITH ANN DAVIDSON v STEPHENROBERTKELLYNZEmpC AUCKLAND[2016] NZEmpC 108 [25 August 2016]  [2] Regrettably, non-compliance resulted in the Court making compliance orders directing payment on four previous occasions.1  [3] Mr Blomfield, advocate for the plaintiff, has now advised the Court that there have now been further defaults, namely a payment of $20,000 which was due on 30 July 2016.  [4] Despite an opportunity being provided to Mr Kelly’s representative to respond, no submission has been filed.  [5] Accordingly, there is no reason by a further compliance order should not now be madein terms of the parties’ agreement to that effect.  [6] I make a compliance order directing that Mr Kelly pay to Ms Davidson the sum of $20,000 by 5.00 pm on Monday, 29 August 2016. If payment is not made, Ms Davidson will be at liberty to enforce payment of the debt.  [7] I reserve any issues as to interest payable from the date of the default, the date of payment, and as to costs in respect of Ms Davidson’s application for the above compliance order.

REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks a recall of our judgment of 1 June 2016 declining him  leave to appeal against a judgment of Andrews J in the High Court.1  [2] Amongst his complaints is the suggestion that his argument as to limitation  was not fully captured in [7] of the leave judgment. In an earlier leave judgment, we  explained his argument in a slightly different and perhaps better way:2  The applicant has the fixed idea that time did not begin to run for limitation purposes until 24 November 2006, which is the date on which he received a letter from the Crown Health Financing Agency denying liability. If this is the case, then his proceedings were issued in time. He considers that he could not have filed proceedings in the High Court until liability was denied.  1 MacKenzie v Attorney-General [2016] NZSC 60. 2 MacKenzie v Legal Services Commissioner [2014] NZSC 49 at [2].

[3] Nothing that has been said in support of the application would warrant a recall of the 1 June 2016 judgment.  Solicitors: Crown Law Office, Wellington for Respondent  At [2].

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 80/2016 [2016] NZSC 105   BETWEEN  X Applicant   AND  COLIN PATRICK WILSON First Respondent   THE QUEEN Second Respondent   Court:  William Young, Glazebrook and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  S M Cooper forApplicant P K Hamlin for First Respondent M A Corlett QC andA Sinclair for Second Respondent   Judgment:  16 August 2016    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a decision of Stevens J in the Court of Appeal not to appoint counsel to represent him at the hearing of an appeal by Mr Wilson against conviction in respect of sexual offending against the applicant.  [2] The issue for Stevens J was concerned directly with the conduct of a criminal appeal in the Court of Appeal. His decision was thus undoubtedly one made “in criminal proceedings”. The jurisdiction of this Court to entertain an appeal in  X v COLIN PATRICK WILSON [2016] NZSC 105[16August 2016]  respect of such a decision is provided by s 10 of the Supreme Court Act 2003, which provides:  10  Appeals against decisions in criminal proceedings  The Supreme Court can hear and determine appeals authorised by—  (a)  Part6 ofthe Criminal ProcedureAct 2011; or   (b)  section 10 or10Aof the CourtMartialAppeals Act 1953.    [3] The proposed appeal is not relevantly authorised and there is, therefore, no jurisdiction to entertain it.

EDITORIAL NOTE: NAMESAND/OR DETAILS IN THIS JUDGMENTHAVE BEENANONYMISED.  IN THE DISTRICT COURT  ATDUNEDIN  CRI-2016-009-007463 [2016] NZDC 23028    NEW ZEALAND POLICE  Prosecutor  v   [VIJAYJOSH]  Defendant  Hearing: 8 August 2016  Appearances: Sergeant G Wilson for the Prosecutor C Hislop for the Defendant  Judgment: 8 August 2016   NOTES OFJUDGE J E MACDONALD ON SENTENCING  [1] Mr [Josh], you have pleaded guilty to two charges.  [2] One charge is under the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015. I was originally perplexed by the summary of facts in terms of the dates but it now seems clear that on 9 June or around 9 June this year you contacted a Facebook group which is a site that posts anonymous Facebook posts. You then requested that a harmful Facebook post directed at the victim be published on the site.  That happened.   [3] Themessages areattached to the summaryoffacts. Ialso haveavictimimpact statement and,unsurprisingly, the victimwas pretty upset bywhat you did. Iimagine that was the whole purpose behind your actions.   [4] You have no previous convictions that are similar.  [VIJAYJOSH] [2017] NZDC 15206 [8 June 2017]  [5] Then on 15 July 2016, at a time when you were already on bail on the earlier charge, you breached a protection order by telephoning the same victim.  [6] I have apre-sentence report that was prepared on an earlier occasion.  It refers to the fact that you are due to commence a programme which arises because of the protection order. Thereport identifies that you have issues with gamblingand alcohol use.   [7] In the end I have decided to deal with your offending by way of sentences of community work. I would have imposed a sentence of reparation for the emotional harm that you undoubtedlycaused the victim but I think the fact that you alreadyowe over $14,000 in fines probably makes that inappropriate in the circumstances.   [8] Fines are something that you will need to deal with and you can deal with that on another occasion. I have not got to the bottom of precisely what hours of community work you might have done and in respect of what fines. I therefore put that to one side.  [9] On these two charges I acknowledge your guilty pleas. As I mentioned, you havenothingsimilar in your past. Oneach chargeyouare convicted and sentenced to 150 hours’ community work.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA275/2016 [2016] NZCA 374  BETWEEN  JEREMYJAMES MCGUIRE Appellant   AND  MANAWATU STANDARDS COMMITTEE First Respondent   LEGAL COMPLAINTS REVIEW OFFICER Second Respondent   Counsel:  Appellant in person   Judgment:  4 August 2016 at 2.30 pm    (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OF FRENCH J (Application for Recall)   The application for recall is declined.  REASONS  [1] In a judgment dated 28 July 2016 I declined Mr McGuire’s application for a review of the Registrar’s decision refusing to waive payment of a filing fee.1 I agreed with the Registrar that Mr McGuire’s appeal did not involve a matter of public interest as would justify waiver.  1 McGuire v Manawatu Standards Committee [2016] NZCA364.  MCGUIRE v MANAWATU STANDARDS COMMITTEE [2016] NZCA374 [4August 2016]  [2] Mr McGuire has now applied to recall the judgment. He does so on the grounds that I overlooked decisions in which judges have awarded costs to legal practitioners who successfully brought judicial review proceedings against disciplinary bodies.2  [3] In his recall application Mr McGuire does not explain how these cases are relevant to the issue of whether his appeal involves a matter of public interest. I can only assume he considers the cases show the law on awarding costs to self-represented lawyers is uncertain and therefore his appeal will bring clarity to the issue. However, that is not so. As stated in myjudgment, the principles on awarding costs against public bodies are well settled. Those principles do not include an absolute bar on awarding costs. The existence of the cases cited by Mr McGuire therefore does not take matters any further as far as waiver of the filing fee is concerned.  He must paythis immediately.  [4] The application for recall is declined.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV 2015-485-611680 [2016] NZHC 1800  IN THE ESTATE OF ANTTI MATIAS NURMELA  Hearing: On Papers Judgment: 4 August 2016  JUDGMENT OF BROWN J  [1] The applicant is the administrator of the estate of Antti Matias Nurmela, pursuant to a grant of letters of administration dated 12 October 2015, made under s 9A(2) of the Administration Act 1969 (the Act) to the attorney of a person entitled who has become mentally incapable.  [2] The person entitled who became mentally incapable, Hely Siru Nurmela, died on 22 April 2016. The applicant is the sole surviving executor under the last will and testament ofHely Siru Nurmela.  [3] Section 9B(2) of the Act provides that if a person entitled dies while the attorney is acting as administrator, within three months after the date of death of the person entitled the attorney must apply to the Court for directions relating to whether the attorney may continue to act as administrator.  [4] The applicant requires further time either to apply for a new grant ofletters of administration in the estate ofAntti Matias Nurmela or for the estate to be wound up.  [5] In those circumstances an order is made in terms of the without notice application for directions in the following te1ms:  IN THE ESTATE OF ANTTI MATIAS NURMELA [2016] NZHC 1800 [4 August 2016]  (a)  the Court directs the applicant to continue to act as administrator upon the letters of administration of the estate of the deceased, Antti Matias Nurmela, dated 12 October 2015 for a period of a further six months;   (b)  leave is reserved to the applicant to apply to extend the period of his administration if circumstances so require.

REASONS  [1] The appellant Mr Creser asks the Court to recall the judgment it delivered on 23 June 2016.1 In that judgment, having reviewed the Deputy Registrar’s decision declining to dispense with security for the costs of this appeal, I upheld that decision.  [2] I have considered:  (a) the appellant Mr Creser’s application of 30 June for recall;  Rabson v Shepherd [2016] NZCA283.  RABSONAND CRESER ASTRUSTEES OF THE MALCOLM RABSON FAMILYTRUSTv SHEPHERD AND DUNPHY[2016] NZCA359[28 July2016]  (b)  the memorandum in opposition filed by Mr Thompson for the   respondents on 8 July;   (c)  Mr Creser’s memorandum of 11 July in reply; and   (d)  a memorandum filed by the appellant Mr Rabson on 11 July, also in reply.    [3] I decline to recall my judgment of 23 June 2016. I do not consider that MrCreser has established that the situation here is one “where for some other very special reason justice requires that the judgment be recalled”.2 In particular, I see force in the point made by Mr Thompson in paragraph 6 of his memorandum in opposition.

IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  CA275/2016 [2016] NZCA 364   BETWEEN JEREMYJAMES MCGUIRE Appellant  AND MANAWATU STANDARDS COMMITTEE First Respondent  LEGAL COMPLAINTS REVIEW OFFICER Second Respondent  Counsel: Appellant in person  Judgment: 28 July 2016 at 4.00 pm (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OFFRENCH J (Review of Registrar’s Decision)   A  The application for a review of the Registrar’s decision refusing to waive   payment of the filing fee is declined.   B  The appellant is ordered to pay the filing fee of $1,100 immediately.     REASONS  [1] Mr McGuire seeks a review of a Registrar’s decision declining to waive payment of the filing fee for an appeal he has filed.  [2] The appeal itself is against a decision of Gendall J in the High Court declining to award Mr McGuire costs in a judicial review proceeding Mr McGuire  MCGUIRE v MANAWATU STANDARDS COMMITTEE [2016] NZCA364 [28 July2016]  had brought against the respondents.1 Mr McGuire was successful in the judicial review proceeding and intends to argue on appeal that costs should have followed the event.  [3] Mr McGuire submits that in declining to waive payment of the filing fee for the appeal, the Registrar has effectively contradicted and/or reinterpreted Gendall J’s decision. This is said to be because Gendall J found the proceeding involved a matter of public interest whereas the Registrar says it does not.  [4] I do not accept that submission. Justice Gendall’s reference to the public interest was in the context of a finding that the respondents had acted in the public interest.2 That was one of the reasons the Judge gave for declining to award costs against them. There is no inconsistency between the Judge’s ruling and the undoubtedly correct finding by the Registrar that Mr McGuire’s appeal does not involve a matter of general public importance or genuine public interest. The principles relating to the awarding of costs against entities exercising statutory functions are well established.  [5] Mr McGuire does not advanceany otherground of review.    [6] I consider the Registrar’s decision was correct. The application for review is declined.  Thefiling feeof $1,100 must be paid immediately.  1 McGuire v Manawatu Standards Committee [2016] NZHC 1052; McGuire v Manawatu Standards Committee HC Palmerston North CIV-2015-454-16, 1 June 2016 [Minute of Gendall J].  2 Minute ofGendall J,above n1,at [7].  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV 2015-470-59 [2016] NZHC 1685  UNDER the Judicature Amendment Act 1972  IN THE MATTER of an Application for Judicial Review  BETWEEN DANIEL LOHR First Applicant  AND ADVENT MANAGEMENT LIMITED Second Applicant  AND ACCIDENT COMPENSATION CORPORATION First Respondent  AND CHIROPRACTIC BOARD Second Respondent  AND A PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT COMMITTEE OF THE CHIROPRACTIC BOARD Third Respondent  Hearing: On Papers  Counsel: First Applicant in Person (viaAVL) No appearance for Second Applicant AK Miller and C D Boyce for Second and Third Respondents No appearance required for First Respondent  Judgment: 22 July 2016  JUDGMENT OF SIMON FRANCE J (COSTS RULING)  LOHR v ACC [2016] NZHC 1685 [22 July 2016]  [1] In a judgment dated 31 May 2016 I upheld the application of the second and third respondents to strike out Dr Lohr's judicial review proceedings. I held the proceedings had settled but Dr Lohr had not filed a notice of discontinuance as required by the settlement. I awarded reasonable indemnity costs.  [2] The respondents seek an award of $14,532.81 being the actual fee together with disbursements of $200. Dr Lohr challenges this as not reasonable. 1 The hourly rates of those working on the file are modest and I consider the sum sought to be entirely reasonable for the nature of the proceeding. I can discern no unnecessary steps on the part of the respondents nor excess in terms of how matters were presented.  [3] An award of $14,532.81 together with disbursements of$200 is confirmed.   Simon France J  There are other grounds that seek to reopen the award of indemnity costs. I put those to one side. 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 6/2016 [2016] NZSC 90   BETWEEN  GARRYALBERT MUIR Applicant   AND  THE COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE Respondent   Court:  William Young,Arnold and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person T G H Smith and S J Leslie for Respondent   Judgment:  20 July 2016    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is granted (Muir v Commissioner of Inland Revenue [2015] NZCA 591).  B The approved questions are whether the Court of Appeal was right:  (i)  to find that the appellant could not arguably pursue claims for the 1999 and following tax years in reliance on sub-pt EH of the Income Tax Act 1994; and   (ii)  to award costs on an indemnity basis against the appellant.    REASONS  [1] In relation to the 1997 and 1998 tax years, we agree with the Court of  Appeal1 that the decisions of this Court in Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v  Commissioner of Inland Revenue2 and Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Redcliffe  1 Muir v Commissioner of Inland Revenue [2015] NZCA591 (Harrison, Dobson and Gilbert JJ).  2 Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue [2008] NZSC 115, [2009] 2 NZLR 289.  GARRYALBERTMUIR vTHE COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE [2016] NZSC 90 [20July2016]  Forestry Venture Ltd3 prevent the applicant, Dr Muir, from claiming deductions under the accrual rules in sub-pt EH of the Income TaxAct 1994, for the reasons the Court gave. The grant of leave accordingly applies only to the 1999 and subsequent tax years and to the indemnitycosts point.  [2] On the first point, the grant of leave is in respect of the question whether the doctrines of issue estoppel and/or abuse of process operate to prevent Dr Muir from pursuing the sub-pt EH argument for the 1999 and subsequent tax years. In respect of issue estoppel, we ask that the parties address the general application of the doctrine in the tax context as well as its application in this particular case (assuming its general application).  [3] We will hear the appeal on a date convenient to counsel in the week beginning 22 August 2016. One day should be sufficient. To facilitate a hearing in that week, Dr Muir is to file and serve his submissions by 5 pm on Thursday 4 August 2016 and the respondent is to file and serve her submissions by 5pm on Thursday 18 August 2016.   [4] Dr Muir’s application for leave to appeal and submissions in support are not as clear as they might be. For the avoidance of doubt, the leave granted does not extend to any issues other than those we have identified.

So too must the appeal. Rule 5.51 of the District Courts Rules applies in civil cases and has no application to this proceeding which involves charges of intentional damage and behaving in a disorderly manner in circumstances likely to cause violence.  [3] To the extent that the appellants claim that New Zealand Courts do not have jurisdiction over people living in New Zealand, they are mistaken. In R v Mitchell, the Court ofAppeal observed:2  [14] This Court has made it plain on a number of occasions now that arguments that are based upon an assertion that the Parliament of New Zealand was not authorised to make law affecting some or all of the persons living in New Zealand cannot succeed before it. Our courts are bound to accept the validity of Acts of Parliament ... [a litigant] is not entitled to put himself outside the law ofNew Zealand.  [4] The application for leave to appeal out of time is dismissed. The appeal is also dismissed.  /'/.4-G·tW-S­ MA Gilbert J  New Zealand Police v White and Ferri [2016) NZDC 8238.

IN THE EMPLOYMENT COURT   AUCKLAND   [2016] NZEmpC 90   EMPC 269/2014   IN THE MATTER OF  an application to enforce a compliance   order under s 138 of the Employment   RelationsAct 2000   BETWEEN  JUDITH ANN DAVIDSON   Plaintiff   AND  STEPHEN ROBERT KELLY   Defendant    EMPC 282/2014  AND IN THE MATTER of a challenge and an application to have a matter heard in the Employment Court under s 139 of the Employment Relations Act 2000  AND BETWEEN JUDITH ANN DAVIDSON Plaintiff  AND STEPHEN ROBERT KELLY Defendant  Hearing: (by submissions dated 5 July 2016)  Appearances: M Blomfield, advocate for the plaintiff  Judgment: 14 July 2016   JUDGMENT NO 4 OF JUDGE B A CORKILL  [1] On 4 December 2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle their differences, the essence of which was that Mr Stephen Kelly would pay Ms Judith Davidson the sum of $300,000 in accordance with an agreed schedule of payments. One of the agreed terms was that the Court would make a compliance order if there was a breach of the payment obligations.  JUDITH ANN DAVIDSON vSTEPHENROBERTKELLYNZEmpC AUCKLAND [2016]NZEmpC 90[14 July2016]  [2] Regrettably, non-compliance resulted in the Court making compliance orders directing payment on threeprevious occasions.1  [3] Mr Blomfield, advocate for the plaintiff, has now advised the Court that there have now been further defaults, namely the fourth payment of $75,000, and the sixth payment of $20,000. The fourth payment was due on 30 April 2016 but time for payment was extended to 30 June 2016; and the sixth payment was also due for payment on 30 June 2016.  [4] Despite an opportunity being provided to Mr Kelly’s representative to respond, no submission has been filed.  [5] Accordingly, there is no reason why a further compliance order should not now be made in terms of the parties’agreement to that effect.  [6] I make a compliance order directing that Mr Kelly pay Ms Davidson the sum of $95,000 by 5.00 pm on 16 July 2016. If payment is not made, Ms Davidson will be at liberty to enforce payment of the debt.  [7] I reserve any issues as to interest payable from the date of the default, the date of payment, and as to costs in respect of Ms Davidson’s application for the above compliance order.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY   CIV 2016-485-494   [2016] NZHC 1577   IN THE MATTER OF  the Wills Act 2007   IN THE ESTATE OF  IAN ALISTER McDONALD   DIANE MCDONALD, MARK ALISTER   MCDONALD, LAUREN KATE   MCDONALD AND FRASER HENRY   MCDONALD   Applicants   On the papers    Counsel: S McKenzie for the applicants Judgment: 12 July 2016  JUDGMENT OF MALLON J  [l] The applicants apply for an order declaring valid a draft will of the deceased, Ian McDonald, made in 2014. The applicants are the deceased's wife and their children. The application is supported by an affidavit from the deceased's wife and from the lawyer who prepared the draft will for the deceased.  [2] The deceased died on 17 March 2016. He left a will dated 10 April 2010. This will appointed his wife as executor and trustee and left his entire estate to her. On or about 1 January 2013 the deceased and his wife separated. On or about 19 June 2014 the deceased and his wife entered into a separation agreement settling all matters relating to their property. On or about 26 June 2014 the deceased instructed his lawyer at the time to prepare a new will which would divide his estate equally to the deceased's three children.  [3] The lawyer prepared a will in accordance with these instructions. He advised the deceased by telephone that he had done so and sought his instructions as to who  Estate oflan Alister McDonald [2016] NZHC 1577 [12 July 2016]  was to be appointed as executor and trustee and to make an appointment for the deceased to sign his will. The deceased wanted to think about who he wanted to appoint and said he would come back to the lawyer about that. The deceased did not make any further contact with his lawyer. The lawyer made a number of attempts to contact the deceased but received no reply. The deceased had by this time changed his job and contact details. He had also instructed a new lawyer in relation to other matters.  [4] The deceased's wife says that she and the deceased had various conversations in the months prior to his death. He confirmed to her that he intended to divide his estate equally amongst his three children. Despite enquiries, no signed will after 10 April 2010 has been found.  [5] The deceased's wife has taken independent legal advice and consents to the 2014 draft will being declared valid. If such an order is not made she will apply for probate of the 10 April 2010 will and give the estate equally to their three children.  [6] I am satisfied on the evidence, in accordance withs 14 of the Wills Act 2007, that the draft will is a document which appears to be a will, it does not comply with the requirements of s 11 of the Act, and it expresses the deceased's testamentary intentions at the time of the instructions and in the months preceding his death. Accordingly I make an order validating the 2014 draft will of the deceased, a copy of which is annexed to the affidavit of Diane McDonald and marked with t letter "F".   ~   
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA659/2015 CA674/2015 [2016] NZCA 314  BETWEEN  SAMIR SAAD Applicant   AND  GARY MCIVOR Respondent   Hearing:  4 July 2016    Court: Harrison, French and Cooper JJ Counsel: Applicant in person and M Saad as McKenzie Friend Respondent in person and M Moncur as McKenzie Friend  Judgment: 7 July 2016 at 10.00 am   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The applications for an extension of time to seek leave under s 214 of the Employment Relations Act 2000 are declined.   REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by French J)  [1] Mr Saad seeks leave to appeal two decisions of the Employment Court under s 214 of the Employment Relations Act 2000.  [2] In the first decision Chief Judge Colgan found that Mr Saad had constructively dismissed the respondent, Mr McIvor, and ordered Mr Saad to pay  SAAD v McIVOR [2016] NZCA 314 [7 July 2016]  loss of remuneration, compensation and a penalty.1 In the second decision the Judge awarded costs in favour of Mr McIvor in relation to both the Employment Court proceeding and an earlier proceeding in the Employment Relations Authority.2  [3] The applications for leave to appeal in respect of both decisions were filed out of time, requiring applications for an extension of time.3  [4] The period of delay in filing the respective applications for leave was not significant and we accept there was some confusion about the time limits.  Mr Saad is self-represented.  [5] However, the applications suffer from a more fundamental defect and that is that none of the proposed grounds of appeal satisfies the prerequisites for granting leave under s 214. None raises questions of law and none raises questions of general or public importance. All the proposed grounds are very much case-specific.  They relate to factual findings and the Chief Judge’s analysis of the evidence.  [6] It follows that, even if the applications for leave had been filed in time, they would not have any prospect of success.  [7] The applications for an extension of time are accordingly declined.  1 McIvor v Saad [2015] NZEmpC 145. 2 McIvor v Saad [2015] NZEmpC 174. 3 Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005, r 29A.  
BEFORE THE ENVIRONMENT COURT  IN THE MATTER  BETWEEN  AND  Decision No. [2016) NZEnvC 2.CS  of ah appeal under Section 358 of the Resource Management Act 1991 (the Act)  SAILORS REST TRUST  (ENV-2015-AKL-000058)  Appellant  THAMES -COROMANDEL DISTRICT COUNCIL  Respondent   Court: Environment Judge M Harland Environment Commissioner ACE Leijnen  Date of Decision: 7 July 2016    FINAL DECISION OF THE ENVIRONMENT COURT  A. The appeal is allowed in part as outlined in the Courts interim decision of 23 May 2016.  8. Sailors Rest Trust is required to pay costs and charges amounting to $26,615.15 to the Thames -Coromandel District Council.     There will be no order of costs on the appeal.   2  REASONS FOR DECISION  [1] On 23 May 2016 we issued an interim decision1 in respect of an appeal by Sailors Rest Trust ("the Trust'') against a decision by an independent commissioner dismissing the Trusts objection to pay charges and costs amounting to $35,285.60 to the Thames-Coromandel District Council ("the Council"). We allowed the appeal in part and determined that the Trust should pay $26,615.15 to the Council. In our decision we recorded in paragraphs [56]-[58] that we had discovered certain discrepancies in the invoices charged by the Council to the Trust which we took into account in reaching the sum of $26, 615.15. Because neither the Council nor the Trust had had an opportunity to address them, we allowed 10 working days for the Council to respond to these matters, with a right of reply by the Trust 5 working days thereafter. It is important to note that the extent of comment sought was limited to the discrepancies we had discovered.  [2] We have since received a memorandum from the Council dated 7 June 2016 and two emails from Mr Wern ham on behalf of the Trust dated 10 and 13 June 2016.  [3) The Council has accepted that our understanding of the discrepancies is correct, with the result that there should be no adjustment to the sum of $26,615.15 outlined in the interim decision. Unfortunately Mr Wernham's response dealt with matters beyond the scope of the Courts enquiry and raised matters which have been already determined by us in our interim decision, but in making this comment we intend no criticism of Mr Wernham who was probably unaware that the Trust's reply was limited in this way.  [4] We thank the parties for their response and confirm our interim decision.  SIGNED at AUCKLAND this =,.~ day of ~l_j 2016  For the Court:   M Harland Environment Judge   
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA175/2016 [2016] NZCA 310  BETWEEN JEFF MCCLINTOCK Appellant  AND THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL First Respondent  RED BEACH BOARD OF TRUSTEES Second Respondent  Counsel: R K Francois for Appellant P T Rishworth QC and M J R Conway for First Respondent P A Robertson for Second Respondent   Judgment: 6 July 2016 at 11.00 am (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OF FRENCH J (Review of Registrar’s Decision)  A  The application for a review of the Registrar’s decision refusing to waive the setting down fee is declined.   B  The appellant is ordered to pay the setting down fee of $2,700 immediately.     REASONS  [1] Mr McClintock seeks a review of a Registrar’s decision declining to waive the setting down fee for an appeal.  MCCLINTOCK v THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL [2016] NZCA 310 [6 July 2016]  [2] The grounds of the Registrar’s decision were that Mr McClintock was in a position to pay the fee and that the appeal was not one of public interest.  [3] On review, counsel for Mr McClintock submits the Registrar erred in two key respects: first, failing to take into account the future costs of this litigation and its effect on Mr McClintock’s limited funds and, secondly, failing to appreciate the public interest in the case.  [4] The appeal itself was an appeal against the decision of a High Court Judge striking out Mr McClintock’s statement of claim in the High Court.1 The appeal was given an urgent hearing and determined in Mr McClintock’s favour.2  Significantly for present purposes, however, this Court declined to award Mr McClintock any costs because of what was described as his “disentitling conduct in the High Court”.3 This related to “continual delays and unexplained breaches of orders”, which is what had prompted the High Court Judge to strike out the statement of claim in the first place.4  [5] In those circumstances, I agree with the Registrar’s view that a distinction can properly be made between the substantive High Court proceeding, which may involve public interest, and the appeal, which plainly did not.  Further, in my view, the Registrar was not required to take into account future and as yet unascertained liabilities.  [6] It follows that I consider the Registrar’s decision was correct.  The application for review is declined. The setting down fee of $2,700 must be paid immediately.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA740/2015 [2016] NZCA 306  BETWEEN AMANDA ADELE WHITE First Applicant  ANNE LEOLINE EMILY FREEMAN Second Applicant  AND CHRISTOPHER MAURICE LYNCH First Respondent  STUART GORDON SPENCE Second Respondent  Counsel: Applicants in person Respondents in person  Judgment: 5 July 2016 at 2.30 pm (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OF FRENCH J (Review of Registrar’s Decision)  The application for a review of the Registrar’s decision refusing to accept a document for filing is declined.   REASONS  [1] Ms White and Ms Freeman filed an appeal on 23 December 2015.  On 26 May 2016 they purported to file an application for a suspension of their adjudication of bankruptcy pending appeal. The Registrar refused to accept the document for filing.  Ms White and Ms Freeman have sought a review of the Registrar’s decision.  WHITE v LYNCH [2016] NZCA 306 [5 July 2016]  [2] The reason given by the Registrar for his decision was that under r 43(1) of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005 the appeal was deemed to have been abandoned on 15 April 2016.  [3] On review, Ms White and Ms Freeman do not dispute there has been a failure to comply with the requirements of r 43.  However, they contend it is the Court’s fault. They submit they would have filed their application for a suspension of adjudication in February 2016 had the Court not advised them such an application should be filed in the High Court.  [4] However, that does not explain the reason for non-compliance with the requirements of r 43, which relate to preparation of the case on appeal and the obtaining of a fixture.  [5] In any event, the rules are very clear. At the time Ms White and Ms Freeman purported to file their suspension application, the appeal no longer existed for that purpose. It was abandoned.  [6] The appropriate course of action is for Ms White and Ms Freeman to revive the appeal by obtaining an extension of time under r 43(3).  I note they have in fact filed an application for such an order, which has yet to be determined.  Issues relating to the reasons for the delay can properly be addressed in that context.  [7] It follows I agree the Registrar was correct to refuse to accept the document for filing and his decision is confirmed.  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND SC 43/2016 [2016] NZSC 82  BETWEEN AUGUSTINE LAU Applicant  AND UMH GROUPLIMITED Respondent  Court: William Young, Arnold and O'Regan JJ  Counsel: Applicant in person R Reed for Respondent  Judgment: 5 July 2016   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant must pay costs of $1,500 to the respondent.    REASONS  [1] Mr Lau seeks leave to appeal against a decision of the Court of Appeal.1 In that decision, the Court of Appeal dismissed Mr Lau’s application for extension of time to appeal against an order of Gilbert J extinguishing a covenant over a property in Auckland.2 That order was madeby GilbertJ without opposition.  [2] Mr Lau does not suggest that he is personally affected by the order. He says he is acting as an agent for Dongfeng Lin, who has filed a caveat over a property said to beaffected bytheorder. Theowner ofthatpropertyis Liansen Mao. MrLau did not explain the nature of this agency in the Court ofAppeal and has not done so  1 Lau v UMH Group Ltd [2016]NZCA132 (Stevens, Cooper andWinkelmannJJ) [UMH (CA)]. 2 UMH Group Ltd HCAuckland CIV-2015-404-1993,13 October 2015.  AUGUSTINE LAU v UMH GROUPLIMITED [2016] NZSC 82 [5 July2016]  in this Court either, despite the reservations expressed by the Court of Appeal about the unexplained nature of the agency.3  [3] The order made by Gilbert J was made on 13 October 2015. There was no opposition from any of the affected parties who had been served notice of the application and provided with a timetable within which to file a notice of opposition. MrMao sought to oppose the order after it was made and Mr Lau unsuccessfully sought a recall of the order by Gilbert J. Some time later the order was served on MrMao. MrLau then applied forthe extension oftime to appeal to theCourt of Appeal, arguing that the delay in serving the order on Mr Mao was the cause of his delay in appealing. As mentioned earlier, there was no explanation why Mr Lau was the proposed appellant, not Mr Mao or Ms Lin.  [4] The Court of Appeal considered the intended appeal to that Court could not succeed.4 In those circumstances an extension of time to appeal was not warranted.  [5] The proposed appeal to this Court does not give rise to any point of public importance. Nor does it give any basis for concern that a miscarriage of justice may occur if leave is not given. The test for the grant of leave to appeal to this Court is not met.5  [6] We therefore dismiss the application.  [7] We award costs of $1,500 to the respondent.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA638/2015 [2016] NZCA 303  BETWEEN  JANINE DAVINA SAX Appellant   AND  LUKEANDREW SIMPSON First Respondent   LUKEANDREW SIMPSONAND JANINE DAVINA SAXAS TRUSTEES OF THE LUKEAND JANINE SIMPSON FAMILYTRUST Second Respondent   Counsel:  G V McArthur forAppellant E M Eggleston for First Respondent   Judgment:  4 July 2016 at 4 pm    (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF COOPER J ON COSTS  The appellant is ordered to pay the first respondent costs in the sum of $450.  [1] This appeal, filed on 3 November 2015, was deemed abandoned under r 43 of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005 on 26 February 2016. The first respondent seeks costs in the sum of $450.   [2] Counsel for the appellant does not challenge the quantum of the costs claimed, but submits that costs should not be settled at this point pending a decision of the Supreme Court on an application for leave to appeal a decision of Miller J. MillerJ declined an application to review the Registrar’s decision on the appellant’s application for dispensation from the requirement to pay security for costs.  SAX v SIMPSON[2016] NZCA303[4 July2016]  [3] I do not regard the outstanding application for leave to appeal in the Supreme Court as a basis for not fixing costs at this stage. Questions might arise as to whether any costs award should be stayed pending the outcome of the Supreme Court proceeding, if leave to appeal is granted. In the meantime, however, fixing costs will be in accordance with r 53A(g) of the Rules that so far as possible, the determination of costs should be expeditious.   [4] The appellant is ordered to pay the first respondent costs in the sum of $450.  Solicitors: Holland Beckett,Tauranga for First Respondent  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY  UNDER  IN THE MATTER OF  BETWEEN AND  On the papers  Judgment: 4 July 2016   CIV 2016-485-262 [2016] NZHC 1513  the Judicature Amendment Act 1972 and s 27(2) ofthe New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990  an application for judicial review under s 16 of the Judicial Conduct Commissioner and Judicial Panel Act 2004  RICHARD JOHN CRESER Applicant  JUDICIAL CONDUCT COMMISSIONER First Respondent  JUSTICES ELIAS, TIPPING, McGRATH, YOUNG, ARNOLD, GLAZEBROOK & O'REGAN Second Respondents   JUDGMENT OF MALLON J  [1] Mr Creser has filed a proceeding seeking various orders arising out of the first respondent's dismissal of a complaint that related to a number of decisions of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court was named as a second respondent in the proceeding, although no relief was claimed against it. A memorandum was filed by counsel for the Supreme Court seeking an order removing it as a party pursuant to s 10(2)(6) ofthe Judicature Amendment Act 1972.  CRESER v JUDICIAL CONDUCT COMMISSIONER [2016] NZHC 1513 [4 July 2016]  [2] Mr Creser has now filed an amended statement of claim. This claim now replaces the Supreme Court as the named second respondent with the names of seven Judges of that Court. It also adds a cause of action alleging that the second respondents acted in bad faith in refusing to amend the court record in compliance with the Public Records Act 2005. It seeks a declaration against the second respondents that they are bound by that Act to keep full and accurate proceedings before the Supreme Court.  [3] Counsel for the second respondents continues to seek an order removing the second respondents as a party. By direction of the High Court made on 13 June 2016 this is to be determined on the papers. 1  [4] I am satisfied the second respondents (whether as named in the original statement of claim or the second amended statement of claim) should be removed as a named party to Mr Creser 's proceeding and I so order. This is because, insofar as the proceeding is concerned with reviewing the first respondent's decision, they are not a necessary party2 and, insofar as Mr Creser seeks to challenge the Supreme Court's actions in respect of the court record, the matter is not reviewable by this court.3  [5] The proceeding is to be listed in the Judge's Chambers List on 11 July 2016.

IN THE EMPLOYMENT COURT   AUCKLAND   [2016] NZEmpC 82   EMPC 269/2014   IN THE MATTER OF  an application to enforce a compliance   order under s 138 of the Employment   RelationsAct 2000   BETWEEN  JUDITHANN DAVIDSON   Plaintiff   AND  STEPHEN ROBERT KELLY   Defendant    EMPC 282/2014  AND IN THE MATTER of a challenge and an application to have a matter heard in the Employment Court under s 139 of the Employment Relations Act 2000  AND BETWEEN JUDITH ANN DAVIDSON Plaintiff  AND STEPHEN ROBERT KELLY Defendant  Hearing: (by submissions dated 16 June 2016)  Appearances: M Blomfield, advocate for the plaintiff  Judgment: 29 June 2016   JUDGMENT NO 3 OF JUDGE B A CORKILL  [1] On 4 December 2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle their differences, the essence of which was that Mr Stephen Kelly would pay Ms Judith Davidson the sum of $300,000 in accordance with an agreed schedule of  JUDITH ANN DAVIDSON v STEPHENROBERTKELLYNZEmpC AUCKLAND[2016] NZEmpC 82 [29 June 2016]  payments. One of the agreed terms was that the Court would make a compliance order if there was a breach of the payment obligations.  [2] Regrettably, non-compliance has resulted in the Court making compliance orders directing payment on two previous occasions.1  [3] Mr Blomfield, advocate for the plaintiff, has advised the Court that there has now been a further default, namely a payment of $20,000 which was due on 30 May2016.  [4] Despite an opportunity being provided to Mr Kelly’s representative to respond, no submission has been filed.  [5] Accordingly, there is no reason why a further compliance order should not now be made in terms of the parties’ agreement to that effect.  [6] I make a compliance order directing that Mr Kelly pay Ms Davidson the sum of $20,000 by 5.00 pm on 1 July 2016.  If payment is not made, Ms Davidson will be at liberty to enforce payment of the debt.   [7] I reserve any issues as to interest payable from the date of default to the date of payment, and as to costs in respect of Ms Davidson’s application for the above compliance order.

He said that he would “beat his baby mama into the ground”, this is amongst other things, because she has been keeping him from her son for ages and that if he “would not go to jail he would make the fat bitch (inaudible 12:11:00) American’s history style” and then he goes on to say, “If you are reading this you bitch, let me see him before you go for a boot ride to the Waimak.”   [2] I have got a victim impact statement which indicates understandable concern from the complainant in this matter.  I raised some concerns about this.  The police have assured me through the sergeant in Court that the local police officer in   [location deleted] dealing with this is a community constable with a good handle on things and he supports readmission to bail.     [3] I have by a slim margin granted bail today on the basis that there is an address available to Mr Josh in [suburb deleted].  That is some very considerable distance from [location deleted].  That will be on the condition that he lives at [address deleted] which is his aunty’s address.  He is not to contact directly or indirectly in any fashion whatsoever, the named complainant unless in the Family Court, and he is not to travel north of the Waimakariri River.   [4] I am satisfied given the lack of violence in Mr Josh’s history along with the requirements contained in s 8 Bail Act 2000 that apply to him, that these terms of bail will contain any risk.  I have also borne in mind the seriousness of the charge which has been laid.  There is a maximum penalty associated with that of only two years’ imprisonment and the likely time before this matter would come to trial in the event that a not guilty plea would be entered.   [5] So in the circumstances you will be granted bail - do not breach it - because as you can, tell this is by a fine margin.  Do you understand?  [Yes Sir.  (Inaudible 12:12:48).]  All right we will see you back here on 13 July.        T J Gilbert  District Court Judge

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV 2015-485-717 [2016] NZHC 1398  UNDER section 164 of the Companies Act 1993  IN THE MATTER of an application for an injunction restraining a breach of the constitution of Dorchester Apartments Ltd  BETWEEN ALEXANDER HILL BRUCE THOMSON AND RICHARD NORMAN MARTIN Plaintiffs  AND  DORCHESTERAPARTMENTS LTD   Defendant   Hearing:  On Papers   Counsel:  C Matsis for Plaintiffs   J Toebes for Defendant   Judgment:  24 June 2016    JUDGMENT OF SIMON FRANCE J (COSTS)  [1] I have read the memoranda.  [2] The interim injunction decision of Clifford J ultimately declined to determine either an award of costs, or payment of them. 1 The matter is therefore at large. The key to the interim injunction ruling is that the status quo was assessed as being the presence of Mr Thomson and the dog. The defendant could have agreed to that, and avoided a hearing. On the other hand, Mr Thomson accepted its presence was in breach of the Rules; he could have removed the dog pending determination of the  Thomson v Dorchester Apartments Ltd [2015] NZHC 2931.  THOMSON AND MARTIN v DORCHESTER APARTMENTS LTD [2016] NZHC 1398 [24 June 2016]  proceedings. Given the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, I consider costs should lie where they fall.  [3] In relation to the matter before me, I do not see the internal aiwngements of the defendant as being a basis for an award of indemnity costs. It is a registered company, and was the party to the proceeding. The shareholders will need to work out a way to fund their litigation expenses.  [4] The defendant is entitled to 2B costs on the application before me, together with reasonable disbursements, to be determined by the Registrar if needed.   Simon France J

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV 2016-485-240 [2016] NZHC 1321  IN THE ESTATE OF IVAN PATRICK CRONIN  Hearing:  On Papers   Counsel:  G P Traves for Applicant   Judgment:  17 June 2016    JUDGMENT OF SIMON FRANCE J  [1] This is an application that will instructions given to an officer of the Public Trust be declared a valid will of the deceased. The deceased passed away on the evening following the giving of instructions to the Public Trust.  [2] On 11 November 2013 Mr Cronin contacted an officer of the Public Trust with whom he had past dealings. He requested the officer, Mr Alan Timu, to visit him in Christchurch Hospital in order to take new will instructions. Mr Cronin indicated he was in hospital pending further assessment and a move to a rest home.  [3] Mr Timu deposes that Mr Cronin was sitting up and alert. The new will instructions differed from the existing will because since that will his wife had died, and he had drifted out of contact with the other specific beneficiaries. He now wished to leave his estate to a friend.  [4] Mr Timu took the instructions and returned to the Public Trust. He entered the instructions into the Public Trust's computer system by completing the electronic Questionnaire. Mr Timu was not at work the next day, but returned the following  ESTATE OF IP CRONIN [2016] NZHC 1321 [17 June 2016]  day only to learn that Mr Cronin had passed away in the night following Mr Timu's visit.  [5] Previous decisions have confirmed it is not necessary for the deceased to have seen the will instructions. 1 There have also been examples of instruction sheets for a will being validated.2 In Re Taigel, the instructions took the form of a solicitor's file note recording his meeting with the deceased.3  [6] The present circumstances satisfy me the statutory test is met. Mr Timu was summonsed for the express purpose of receiving instructions for a new will. It is apparent the deceased had considered the matter, and was clear on his intentions. There is no reason to consider there was a change of mind between the giving of instructions and his passing.  [7] I am satisfied the will instructions entered by Mr Timu on 11 November 2013 and now appearing in the form of the Public Trust Questionnaire for Will represent the testamentary intentions of Mr Cronin, and I declare the Questionnaire to be a valid will.  [8] I note for the record that all persons who were to take under the previous will have indicated their consent to the present application.

         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY    CIV-2016-485-116  [2016] NZHC 1318       UNDER     the Insolvency Act 2006      IN THE MATTER OF     the bankruptcy of Andrew Richard Bate      BETWEEN     COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE  Judgment Creditor      AND     ANDREW RICHARD BATE  Judgment Debtor       On the Papers                Counsel:     T D Lancaster for the Judgment Creditor No appearance for the Judgment Debtor      Judgment:     17 June 2016         JUDGMENT OF ASSOCIATE JUDGE SMITH  [1] On 31 May 2016, the judgment debtor was adjudicated bankrupt.     [2] Before that date, counsel for the judgment creditor had filed a memorandum explaining a potential confusion in relation to the judgment debtor’s name.  In the District Court judgment on which the bankruptcy notice had been based, the debtor’s given names had been transposed, a feature which carried through into his name in the bankruptcy notice.  By the time the adjudication application was issued, counsel for the Commissioner had identified the transposition and in the documents filed from the application for adjudication order onwards, the debtor’s names appeared in the correct order.     [3] Accordingly, when the Court adjudicated the judgment debtor bankrupt, it was pursuant to the application for adjudication and the formal order should correctly record the debtor as “Andrew Richard Bate”.    [4] Technically, there remains a defect in the proceeding in that the bankruptcy notice rendered the debtor’s given names in the reverse order.   [5] For the purpose of remedying the defect on the Court file, I recall the judgment dated 31 May 2016.       [6] I order that the defect in the bankruptcy notice whereby the judgment debtor (Andrew Richard Bate) is identified as “Richard Andrew Bate” is corrected so that the bankruptcy notice shall be treated as having read “Andrew Richard Bate”.   I dispense with amendment and re-service of the Notice.    [7] Save to the extent of that order, the order made on 31 May 2016 stands as it was made, with the debtor’s adjudication timed at 10.20 am on 31 May 2016.

PUBLICATION OF NAME, ADDRESS, OCCUPATION OR IDENTIFYING PARTICULARS OF COMPLAINANT PROHIBITED BY S 203 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT 2011.  IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA539/2014 [2016] NZCA 260  BETWEEN  S (CA539/2014) Appellant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Hearing:  13 June 2016    Court: Miller, Mallon and Peters JJ Counsel: CWJStevenson forAppellant J E Mildenhall for Respondent Judgment: 15 June 2016 at 3.00 pm   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  Application for non-party disclosure under s 24 of the Criminal Disclosure Act 2008 is declined.   REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Mallon J)  [1] The appellant was convicted, following a District Court jury trial in June 2014, of rape and sexual violation by unlawful sexual connection. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment. He has appealed against his conviction. The  S (CA539/2014) v R [2016] NZCA260[15 June 2016]  issue at this stage relates to the appellant’s application for disclosure which has been made for the purposes of advancing the appeal.1  [2] The application seeks information concerning any mental health condition or disorder affecting the complainant. The information is sought from two medical centres in this country, which the complainant advises she visited at the relevant time. Summonses were issued so that the medical records could be provided to the Court at this disclosure hearing and a decision could then be made as to whether they ought to be disclosed to the appellant.2  [3] One of the medical centres provided the complainant’s medical records in a sealed envelope with a letter from the relevant doctor advising that there was no “mental health component in the presentation”. As a result disclosure of these records is not pursued. Accordingly we have not inspected the medical records and they will be destroyed.  [4] The other medical centre provided the records at the disclosure hearing. Having inspected the records we were satisfied that they did not contain any details of any mental health condition or disorder and therefore provided no elaboration of the disability or disorder described in an unrelated claim the complainant has brought against her employer in Australia and which led to the disclosure application.3 We therefore advised counsel at the disclosure hearing that the application for disclosure is formally declined. These records were returned to the practice manager who attended the hearing.  [5] Counsel forthe appellant intends to makefurther enquiries in Australia. Itis envisaged that the appeal against conviction will only be pursued if those enquiries uncover materially relevant information. Counsel for the appellant will file a memorandum setting out the steps he proposes to take and the timeframe for those steps so that a time for the appeal, if it is to proceed, can be scheduled.

B The application for an extension of time is granted.  BRILLv LABOUR INSPECTOR (MELISSAANN MACRURY) [2016] NZCA262 [15 June2016]  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Miller J)  [1] We need not give reasons for granting leave to appeal from the Employment Court.1 So far as the extension of time is concerned, there is force in the respondent’s contention that the delay is insufficiently explained, but the appeal raises an important and arguable question and the delay is not so extensive as to justify refusing an extension in the circumstances.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 30/2015 [2016] NZSC 65   BETWEEN  DEREK NICHOLAS BLACKWELL AND CHARLES BASIL BLACKWELL AS EXECUTORSAND TRUSTEES OF THE ESTATE OF ROSS WINSTON BLACKWELL Appellants   AND  EDMONDS JUDD Respondent    Court: Elias CJ, William Young, Glazebrook, Arnold and O'Regan JJ Counsel: CT Gudsell QC forAppellants M R Ring QC and J R Parker for Respondent Judgment: 15 June 2016  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for recall is dismissed. B Costs of $1,000 are awarded to the respondent.    REASONS  (Given by Glazebrook J)  [1] On 10 May 2016 the appellants filed a memorandum indicating that a dispute had arisen between the parties as to the interpretation of [87] of this Court’s judgment of 22 April 2016. They sought clarification of the meaning of that paragraph, which reads:1  Blackwell v Edmonds Judd [2016] NZSC 40. DEREK NICHOLAS BLACKWELLAND CHARLES BASILBLACKWELLAS EXECUTORS AND TRUSTEES OF THE ESTATE OF ROSSWINSTONBLACKWELLv EDMONDS JUDD [2016] NZSC 65 [15 June2016]  The appellants, in their statement of claim, sought interest on the judgment sum pursuant to the Judicature Act 1908. We consider it appropriate to award interest at five per cent (the prescribed rate pursuant to s 87(3) of the Judicature Act) on the judgment sum from the date of settlement by the Chicks ofthe purchase of the farm.  [2] By minute of O’Regan J of 16 May 2016, the Court said that it intended to treat the memorandum of 10 May 2016 as an application to recall the judgment. The respondent was given the opportunity to file submissions on the application and it was indicated that the Court would deal with the matter on the papers.  [3] The appellants interpret the words “from the date of settlement by the Chicks of the purchase of the farm” as referring to the date the purchase would have been settled but for the High Court proceedings: 30 April 2010. They submit that this conclusion follows from the context of the judgment as a whole and in particular [84]–[85] of the judgment. It also follows from the fact that they did not receive the judgment sum of $1m on 30 April 2010 as they would have done in the absence of the respondent’s negligence.  [4] The respondent interprets the words “from the date of settlement” as referring to the date on which settlement of the transaction was formally completed. It is submitted on behalf of the respondent that paragraph [87] of the judgment is clear and unambiguous. There is therefore no reason to recall the judgment.  [5] We accept therespondent’s submission.  The wording of the judgment is clear and it has the meaning the respondent contends. We comment that the appellants retained ownership of the farm until the transaction was actually settled and that, as the respondent points out, no submissions on interest were made at the hearing of the appeal.  [6] For the above reasons the application for recall is dismissed. Costs of $1,000 are awarded to the respondent.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 45/2016 [2016] NZSC 63   BETWEEN  JESSE WAIARIKITEMANAVA BUTLER Applicant   AND  NORTH SHORE POLICE Respondent   Court:  William Young, Glazebrook and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person K Laurenson for Respondent   Judgment:  13 June 2016    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] At around midnight on 17 February 2014 the applicant was arrested by two police officers on a charge of assault. He was initially taken to the Takapuna Police Station and subsequently to the Henderson Police Station from which he was released on police bail at 4.18 am.  He was later found guilty of assault.  [2] He subsequently issued proceedings in which he claimed that the police officers involved in his arrest and subsequent detention had breached his rights under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 in various respects, including what he alleged to be torture and cruel treatment, and he alleged the police were guilty of misfeasance in public office. Following a trial at which the applicant and the police  JESSE WAIARIKI TEMANAVABUTLER vNORTH SHORE POLICE [2016] NZSC 63[13 June 2016]  officers who had dealt with him gave evidence, Asher J dismissed the applicant’s claims.1  [3] Theapplicant’s noticeofappeal to the Court ofAppeal was filed out oftime.2 The reason for the delay was that he had, initially, mistakenly attempted to file an appeal in the High Court at Auckland. The respondent did not suggest that the resulting delay had caused it any prejudice. While recognising these considerations, the Court of Appeal refused to extend time for the appeal as it considered that the appeal was not arguable.3  [4] Many of the arguments advanced by the applicant in his submissions in support of his leave application are at best only tangentially related to the events in issue and, to the limited extent to which he did focus on those events, he advanced nothing which would suggest that the Court ofAppeal’s appreciation of the merits of his proposed appeal was erroneous. We see no question of public or general importance in the appeal and no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WANGANUI REGISTRY CIV-2016-483-0017 [2016] NZHC 1227  BETWEEN THE BANK OF NEW ZEALAND Plaintiff  AND  ROBERT ASHLEY RILLS TONE   Defendant   Hearing:  8 June 2016   Counsel:  NA Refoy-Butler for the Plaintiff   No appeareance for the Defendant   Judgment:  8 June 2016    JUDGMENT OF ASSOCIATE JUDGE SMITH  [1] The plaintiff applies for summary judgment against Mr Rillstone for amounts owing by him personally under a home loan agreement entered into on 17 July 2012, and in his capacity as guarantor of certain advances and overdraft accommodation made by the plaintiff to R A Rillstone Log Cartage Ltd (in liquidation) (the company).  [2] Service on Mr Rillstone was completed on 4 April 2016. He has not filed any notice of opposition, and he did not appear at the hearing today.  [3] For the plaintiff, Mr Dermot Rodden, manager of Strategic Business Services, has provided an affidavit verifying the contents of the plaintiff's statement of claim and deposing to his belief (and the plaintiff's belief) that Mr Rillstone has no defence to the claims.  [4] The company was placed in liquidation on 24 June 2015. While the plaintiff did make a recovery on the sale of certain secured property, there was a shortfall. On  THE BANK OF NEW ZEALAND v ROBERT ASHLEY RILLSTONE [2016] NZHC 1227 [8 June 2016]  19 February 2016 the plaintiff demanded the total $363,095.36 that was then owing. No payments have since been made by Mr Rill stone.  [5] I am satisfied that the plaintiff has sufficiently proved its claims and is entitled to summary judgment. In accordance with a schedule produced by counsel, the total amount of the claim, apart from costs, is $376,908.06. That sum is made up of the balance owing by Mr Rillstone under the various facilities, together with interest in the total sum of $13,812.70 calculated to 8 June 2016.  [6] Under the various facilities granted by the plaintiff to the company and Mr Rillstone, the plaintiff was entitled to recover any costs incun-ed by it in recovering money owing by Mr Rillstone or the company. Counsel has produced copies of invoices showing total fees rendered to the plaintiff of $4,948.80, plus disbursements totalling $1,756.41. I am satisfied that those fees and costs are reasonable.  [7] I accordingly enter judgment for the plaintiff against Mr Rillstone in the sum of $376,908.06, including interest calculated to 8 June 2016. I also make an order for costs in the plaintiff's favour in the sum of $4,948.80, and disbursements in the sum of $1,756.41.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY  IN THE MATTER  BETWEEN AND  Judgment: 6 June 2017   CIV-2016-485-000976 [2017] NZHC 1208  of an appeal pursuant to s 106 of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003  HIRRON FERNANDO Appellant  PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT COMMITTEE Respondent   JUDGMENT OF FAIRE J [Costs]  [1] On 18 May 2017, I dismissed the appellant's appeal against the decision of the New Zealand Health Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal dated 11 November 2016. That decision which was made pursuant to s 101 of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 censured the appellant, cancelled his registration and ordered him to pay costs.  [2] My judgment recorded the following in relation to costs: 1  Ms Hughson requested costs for the respondent on an indemnity basis. I am not satisfied that the provisions of r 14.6(4) of the High Court Rules apply. The respondent is, however, entitled to costs on a 2B basis. If counsel cannot agree on the application of category 2 band B to this case, memoranda in support, opposition and reply shall be filed and served at seven-day intervals. On receipt of the reply memoranda, the file shall be referred to me, or to another Judge in my absence, for conclusion of costs.  [3] Counsel for the respondent circulated a schedule of costs and disbursements in reliance on rr 14.3 and 14.5. Counsel for the appellant advised by email that the  Fernando v Professional Conduct Committee [2017] NZHC 1028.  FERNANDO v PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT COMMITTEE [2017] NZHC 1208 [6 June 2017]  costs were correctly calculated in that schedule. She also confirmed that it was appropriate for the respondent to seek the security for costs which had been paid into court.  [4] The appellant has now advised by email that he will object to the costs and that he has no intention of paying those costs. In the circumstances it is necessary that judgment for costs be entered.  [5] The calculation completed by cou11sel for the respondent of the costs due on a 2B basis in the sum of $10,258 is correct and complies with the High Court Rules. The one disbursement claim is for printing costs in relation to the appeal in the sun, of $21 1. That is an appropriate disbursement.  [6] Accordingly, r enter judgment against the appellant for costs and disbursements in the sum of $l 0,469. I authorise the Registrar to release in part­satisfaction of that judgment the amount paid as security for costs in the sum of $1,115.

That application was dismissed by way of judgment dated 9 March 2016.3  1 Scarborough v Micron Security Products Ltd [2015] NZEmpC 39 (substantive). 2 Scarborough v Micron Security Products Ltd [2015] NZEmpC 105 (costs). 3 Scarborough v Micron Security Products Ltd [2016] NZCA54.  YASODHARADASILVEIRASCARBOROUGH v MICRON SECURITYPRODUCTS LIMITED NZEmpC AUCKLAND [2016] NZEmpC 66 [2June2016]  [2] The plaintiff has now filed a further application in the Court of Appeal, seeking an extension of time to file an application for leave to appeal this Court’s substantive judgment. The application for an extension, and for leave if an extension is granted, is being opposed by the defendant.  The plaintiff seeks a stay of the costs award pending determination of her most recent application.  [3] Counsel for the defendant have filed a memorandum confirming that the defendant does not oppose a stay preventing enforcement of the costs award until such time as the Court of Appeal has determined the application for an extension of time and, if granted, the application for leave to appeal.   [4] In view of the above matters the following orders are made:  (a)  There is an order staying execution of the costs judgment of this Court pending the Court of Appeal’s determination of the plaintiff’s application for an extension of time and leave to appeal and, if leave is granted, the substantive appeal.    (b)  The plaintiff is to pursue her applications in the Court of Appeal, and any subsequent appeal if leave is granted, diligently and in a timely manner.   (c)  In the event that the Court of Appeal declines to extend time, and/or leave to appeal is not granted to the defendant, the stay will immediately lapse.

LIMITED  Defendant           Hearing:     31 May 2016       Appearances:     D M Brabant for the Prosecutor  N R Williams for the Defendant      Judgment:     1 June 2016         NOTES OF JUDGE G A REA ON SENTENCING  [PART 2]           [1] On 18 April 2016 sentencing for the above named Defendant was due to be completed in the Waipukurau District Court.  I was able to deal with the issue of reparation in a decision delivered on that day but there was a dispute about whether the Defendant company was in a financial position to meet a fine in addition to the reparation ordered.  The matter was adjourned for a teleconference on 31 May 2016.     [2] At 9.30am on 31 May 2016 I spoke with both Counsel by telephone.  Ms Brabant advised that the Defendant company had provided additional material which indicated that it was not in a financial position to meet a fine.  She asked for a short time to finally consider all of the material before a final decision was made.     [3] On 1 June 2016 I received a memorandum from Ms Brabant confirming that the Informant accepts that the Defendant is not in a position to pay a fine given its current financial position.  Accordingly since it is accepted that the Defendant cannot meet a fine in addition to the reparation already ordered it is not possible to impose a fine on it and therefore the matter will be dealt with solely by the reparation orders already made.     [4] Ms Brabant has asked me to undertake an analysis and arrive at what the fine would have been in accordance with the principles in Hanham & Philp and make a declaration as to the starting point in terms of culpability and what the end fine would have been if the company was in a position to pay it.   [5] The position, as confirmed by Ms Brabant, is that the Defendant is not in a position where a fine can be imposed upon it in addition to reparation.  While during the course of the teleconference on 31 May 2016 I indicated I was prepared to accede to Ms Brabant’s request and declare what the fine would have been if one could have been imposed I have reflected upon that and I do not believe that it is appropriate to do so.  On the facts of this case it is accepted that the Defendant cannot pay any fine at all.  For me to arrive at a hypothetic figure totally unrelated to the facts of the case before me is not part of my function and in my view would not be appropriate.   [6] To arrive at what an appropriate fine might have been there may well be issues other than the ability to pay that would be taken into account and although I have written submissions from Counsel those submissions would have to be in the context of what the real position was and not in a situation such as this.  In cases such as this there cannot really be any precedent value in a one-off District Court decision as to penalty and that is certainly the case if the matter was only dealt with hypothetically.  Accordingly for the reasons I have given I am not prepared to state what the fine would have been in other circumstances and I therefore decline to deal with the matter in that way.

         IN THE DISTRICT COURT  AT GISBORNE    CRI-2014-082-000389    [2016] NZDC 9458       NEW ZEALAND POLICE    Prosecutor    v        HEREMIA HAKOPA  Defendant           Hearing:     26 May 2016      Appearances:     Sergeant C Neustroski for the Prosecutor  A P Dreifuss for the Defendant      Judgment:     26 May 2016         NOTES OF JUDGE A J ADEANE ON SENTENCING   [1] Mr Hakopa has been convicted by a jury on one count of unlawful sexual connection with a child.  The circumstances are that he, at 24 years of age, was in the position of trust and influence over a girl aged between five and six years.  This offending took place back in the period 1996 to 1997.   [2] On one occasion when the child was in the bedroom, the defendant lifted her up and placed his mouth on her vagina, thereby committing an act of sexual violation by unlawful sexual connection.   [3] Obviously the aggravating features are the position of trust and the age of the young victim.  The child of course was completely vulnerable to this sort of behaviour and the defendant simply took advantage of that.     [4] The case is made the more troubling because Mr Hakopa does not accept the verdict of the jury and continues to maintain simply that he is innocent of this offending.  The jury verdict however is conclusive insofar as this Court is concerned.   [5] The guideline case is R v A M [2010] NZCA 114; 2 NZLR 750 which sets out a series of categories of offending.  In my view this matter is capable of being categorised in band 1 of sexual violation, but only just because of the age and vulnerability of the child.   [6] The defendant’s personal circumstances are set out in the probation report.  Otherwise they are unexceptional; he is a contributing member of the community, but this conviction demonstrates a significant flaw in his character.   [7] There is a submission that he should receive a youth discount for the fact that he was 24 years of age at the time of the offending.  Given the age difference between he and the victim, in my view, and the nature of the offending itself, a discount for youth in those circumstances would be quite inappropriate and I decline to make one.   [8] I adopt a starting point of three years’ imprisonment.  There is only one matter for which a discount might be entertained and that is the absence of previous convictions.  That however, has to be seen in the context of an ongoing refusal to accept the jury’s verdict in this matter, or to acknowledge guilt.  That of course is never an aggravating feature, but it may be a feature that bears on the appropriateness of discounts.   [9] In the circumstances, in my view, a discount of 10 percent is quite adequate to recognise the previous absence of convictions and accordingly, Mr Hakopa is sentenced for this to 32 months’ imprisonment.

Hill v Maori Trustee [2016] NZHC 364 at [79]. HILL v MAORI TRUSTEE [2016] NZHC 1072 [23 May 2016]  [2] I invited memoranda, and although Mr Hill did not respond specifically on costs within the time limit specified, in dismissing a subsequent application by him for a stay of the effect of my judgment I indicated that I would grant him further time to respond to the application on behalf of the Maori Trustee for increased costs.  [3] A document purporting to do that was filed by Mr Hill on 15 May 2016. From the terms of Mr Hill's memorandum it is very difficult to discern any relevant grounds for opposition to the costs sought. For instance, the first paragraph of his memorandum states:  The appellant states that the Comt has through neglect ruled that the estate it is purporting to charge against for costs incurred by New Zealand law society member the Maori Trustee and agent Ms C Reuhman cannot be identified by registration or free and intelligent consent in the proceeding.  [4] This is very clearly a proceeding in which the usual rule that costs should follow the event is appropriately applied. The Maori Trustee has calculated the scale costs on a 2B basis at $8,288. However, the memorandum filed on behalf of the Maori Trustee dated 24 April 2016 seeks increased costs on the basis that responding appropriately to Mr Hill's various initiatives in the proceeding required a more than usual level of resources. For instance, there were six case management conferences and an additional three memoranda filed in respect of them.  [5] Having reviewed the history of the proceedings, in light of the District Comi judgment and my own, I am satisfied that materially more than a usual level of resources were appropriately required from the Maori Trustee to deal with steps that appear to have included diversionary and delaying tactics by Mr Hill. Ultimately, many of the points he sought to raise were completely untenable.  [6] The Maori Trustee has sought an uplift of 50 per cent. I consider that is justified. I accordingly order costs in favour of the Maori Trustee in the sum of  $12,432.    Dobson J  Solicitors: Maori Trustee, Wellington  Copy to: F PK Hill  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  AUCKLAND REGISTRY   CIV-2016-404-1008   [2016] NZHC 1043   IN THE MATTER  of the JudicatureAct 1908    INTHE MATTER of a witness summons to attend at the Family Court at Auckland  BETWEEN GREGORY SCOTTFINUCANE Applicant  AND REGISTRAR OFTHE DISTRICT  COURTATAUCKLAND  First Respondent  JULIA MARGARET GALBREATH Second Respondent  Hearing: 19 May 2016  Appearances: A G V Rogers forApplicant No appearance for Respondents  Judgment: 19 May 2016  JUDGMENT OF LANG J  This judgment was delivered by me on 19 May 2016 at 3.30 pm, pursuant to Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules.  Registrar/Deputy Registrar Date……………  FINUCANE v REGISTRAR OF THE DISTRICTCOURT[2016] NZHC 1043 [19 May2016]  [1] In this proceeding Dr Finucane seeks an order setting aside a witness summons directing him to attend to give evidence at the Family Court in Auckland on 23 May 2016.  Dr Finucane has filed the application becausehe is also required to give evidence on the same date at a criminal hearing in the District Court at Christchurch. In that proceeding Dr Finucane is scheduled to give evidence on behalf of a defendant who is charged with careless driving causing death. The Christchurch hearing is scheduled to occupy three days.  [2] I can understand Dr Finucane’s concern, because Judge Neave has apparently indicated that he would prefer the expert witnesses in the Christchurch proceeding to be present at Court when the lay witnesses give evidence. Dr Finucane is not, however, summonsed to attend the Christchurch hearing, and I consider he can adequately discharge his responsibilities to the Court by reading a transcript of the evidence given at that hearing on 23 May 2016. It is anticipated that Dr Finucane will be able to complete his evidence in Auckland by early afternoon on 23 May, and will then be able to travel to Christchurch to meet his obligations in respect of the Christchurch hearing.  [3] I consider that Dr Finucane’s obligation to attend the Family Court in Auckland on 23 May 2016 has priority. For that reason I am not prepared to set the witness summons in respect of that hearing aside.  [4] The application to set aside the witness summons is dismissed.

BEFORE THE ENVIRONMENT COURT  Decision No. [2016] NZEnvC9e5  IN THE MATTER of the Resource Management Act 1991 and an appeal pursuant to s 120 of the Act  BETWEEN  LUKE PICKERING   AND  (ENV-20 l 5-CHC-032) Appellant CHRISTCHURCH CITY COUNCIL   Respondent   AND  WINDFLOW TECHNOLOGY LTD    Applicant  Hearing: In Chambers at Christchurch Court: Environment Judge J E Borthwick Date of Decision: 18 May 2016  Date oflssue: 18 May 2016  DECISION OF THE ENVIRONMENT COURT ON APPLICATION FOR WAIVER  A: Under section 28l(l)(a)(i) of the Resource Management Act 1991, the Environment Court grants the application by the Christchurch City Council to lodge landscape evidence out of time .  . REASONS  i  :s  ~ '' ' ~  ',~,11 ...~­ '-~9-~~  2  Introduction  [1] The court made evidence exchange directions in the Record of Telephone Conference dated 1 April 2016. Any evidence in reply on the topic of landscape was to be served by 22 April 2016.  [2] The Christchurch City Council has filed an application pursuant to s 281 of the Resource Management Act 1991 seeking to file its landscape evidence out of time.  [3] The Christchurch City Council filed its evidence and an application for waiver on 9 May 2016, which is ten days out from the time limit imposed by the court. While a reason for the delay is not provided, the Christchurch City Council explains that it considers the evidence may be of assistance to the court and other parties given the withdrawal of Mr Hill's appeal and the receipt of evidence statements from the s 274 parties.  [4] The other parties were asked to advise the court of their position on the application by 11 May 2016. There has been no opposition.  Consideration  [5] In granting a waiver under s 281 of the Resource Management Act 1991, the court must be satisfied that none of the parties to the proceeding will be unduly prejudiced.  [6] I cannot see that the granting of the waiver will unduly prejudice any party. On that basis, and as the application is unopposed, I am prepared to grant the waiver as sought.   
         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WHANGANUI REGISTRY    CIV-2016-483-17  [2016] NZHC 1020       UNDER     the Trustee Act 1956      IN THE MATTER      of the Neil Wilsher Family Trust      BETWEEN     MARGARET HELEN REID  Plaintiff      AND     MAY HARRIET WILSHER  Defendant       On the papers:                Counsel:     M J Bullock for Plaintiff      Judgment:     18 May 2016         JUDGMENT OF CLIFFORD J    [1] The Neil Wilsher Family Trust (the Trust) was established by Mr Wilsher in March 1992.  Mr Wilsher is deceased.  Since establishment, the trustees of the Trust have been the applicant, Margaret Reid, along with her mother, May Harriet Wilsher and her sister, Barbara May Wolfenden (now Wilsher).   [2] Mrs May Wilsher is no longer mentally competent.  Acting under s 43 of the Trustee Act 1956, Margaret Reid and Barbara Wilsher have recently appointed a new trustee in Mrs May Wilsher’s place.  That new trustee is JRT Trustees Limited.   [3] To enable the Trust to continue to function, and for the trustees to deal with the property of the Trust, Mrs Reid now seeks orders under s 52 of the Trustee Act 1956 vesting the Trust’s property at 19A Fergusson Street, Whanganui in the names of herself, her sister Barbara Wilsher and JRT Trustees Limited as the current    trustees of the Trust.   At the same time, Mrs Reid also seeks an order removing her mother, Mrs May Wilsher, as a trustee.   [4] As a preliminary matter, I note that at the same time as filing her statement of claim, Mrs Reid applied for an order that service on her mother be dispensed with and that the application be decided on the papers.  Having read the affidavit material, including the medical reports provided, I am satisfied that service on Mrs Wilsher would serve no purpose.  I am also satisfied that Mrs Barbara Wilsher and JRT Trustees Limited support Mrs Margaret Reid’s application.  I therefore order that service of the proceeding on Mrs Wilsher be dispensed with and that no other person need be served.  I also determine that it is appropriate to decide this application, as requested, on the papers.   [5] I am not persuaded that an order removing Mrs May Wilsher as trustee is called for.  Under s 43 of the Trustee Act, JRT Trustees Limited has been appointed a trustee in place of Mrs May Wilsher, because Mrs May Wilsher is unfit to act.  That appointment, in my view, brings Mrs May Wilsher’s trusteeship to an end.  Adopting the words of s 43(1), JRT Trustees has been appointed “in the place of” Mrs May Wilsher.  Her appointment is, therefore, at an end.   [6] It is, however, appropriate to make the order vesting the Trust property in the names of the three continuing trustees.  Section 52 of the Trustee Act provides for the making of such a vesting order in these circumstances.  Accordingly, there will be an order vesting the property at 19A Fergusson Street, Whanganui, Certificate of Title WN40D/141 in the names of the plaintiff, Margaret Helen Reid, her sister, Barbara May Wilsher and JRT Trustees Limited.                  “Clifford J”      Solicitors:   Bullock and Associates, Whanganui for Plaintiff  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 33/2016 SC 42/2016 [2016] NZSC 55   BETWEEN  AMANDAADELE WHITE First Applicant   ANNE LEOLINE EMILY FREEMAN Second Applicant   AND  CHRISTOPHER MAURICE LYNCH First Respondent   STUART GORDON SPENCE Second Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, William  Young and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  First and SecondP J Wright and J Applicants in person CAdams for Respondents   Judgment:  17 May 2016    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The applications for leave to appeal are dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicants both seek leave to appeal a decision by Wild J upholding the decision of a Deputy Registrar declining to dispense with security for costs.1 The first named applicant also seeks leave to appeal against a decision by Kós J dismissing an application to review a decision of a Deputy Registrar declining to accept an application for review purportedly made under s 61A(2) of the Judicature Act 1908 of the earlier decision ofWild J.2  1 White v Lynch [2016] NZCA78. 2 White v Lynch [2016] NZCA149.  AMANDAADELE WHITE v CHRISTOPHER MAURICE LYNCH [2016] NZSC 55 [17May2016]  [2] These cases arise out of a property dispute in the High Court in which Priestley J found against the applicants.3 An award of costs was made against them. The applicants appealed against the judgment of Priestley J but upon their application to call further evidence being declined, they did not prosecute this appeal.4 A further order for costs was made against them.5 The respondents issued bankruptcy notices against the applicants based on the costs orders. The applicants unsuccessfully sought to challenge the original judgment against them on the basis that it was obtained by fraud.6 These proceedings were struck out and an allied challenge to the bankruptcy notice was dismissed.7 The applicants’ later appeal against those decisions was deemed to be abandoned when securityfor costs was not provided. They then sought rescission of the strike out decision and to defend the bankruptcy proceedings on the basis that the strike out judgment had itself been obtained by fraud. They were unsuccessful before Faire J8 and the issues before Wild and Kós JJ were in relation to the appeal against that judgment of Faire J.  [3] Their challenge to the decision of the Deputy-Registrar was evaluated by Wild J in accordance with the principles laid down by this Court in Reekie.9 The Judge’s reasons make convincing reading. The proposed appeal does not raise any issue of public or general importance and there is no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.  [4] The second application is without merit. In Reekie, this Court held that there is no right to apply under s 61A(2) of the JudicatureAct in respect of a decision of a single judge dismissing an application to review a decision of a registrar declining to dispense with security.10  Solicitors: Sellar Bone,Auckland for Respondents  3 Spence v Lynch [2013] NZHC 1478.  4 White v Spence [2014] NZCA 298.

PRECASTNZ LIMITED v ANYSTEP LIMITED & ORS [2016] NZHC 995 [17 May 2016]  [1] By my Judgment dated 8 March 2016, the plaintiff's application for interim relief was granted. 1 I noted that the plaintiff was entitled to costs and, if the parties were unable to agree, memoranda should be filed.  [2] The plaintiff seeks costs and disbursements on a 2B basis. The defendants have not replied to the plaintiff's communications in this regard.  [3] The time having expired for the defendants to file a memorandum with the Court, I am satisfied that an order for costs and disbursements on a 2B basis is appropriate and make an Order in the sum of$8,165.20.

[2] I refer to the memorandum of counsel for the defendant dated 26 April 2016 and the memoranda in response from the plaintiff dated 29 April and 12 May 2016.  [3] By consent, I vary the terms of paragraph [19](1) of my judgment of 22 April 2016. The Registrar is able to require applicants for a licence (or renewal of a licence) to consent to the disclosure by the police of any records of findings of liability for an infringement offence which carries a maximum penalty of $10,000 or more.  [4] I also vary by consent the terms of paragraph [19](2) and (3) to make it clear that the threshold for infringement offences (for pending charges and discharges/diversion) is a maximum penalty of $10,000 or more.  [5] My judgment of 22 April 2016 has been redistributed to reflect these changes.  DOMB v REAL ESTATE AGENTS AUTHORITY [2016] NZHC 954 [12 May 2016]  [6] Having considered the submissions of both parties on costs in relation to the substantive proceeding, I have decided that both parties exceeded and failed in their arguments to varying degrees. Ultimately, I have decided the overall interests of justice is served by allowing costs to lie where they fall. There is accordingly no order for costs in this proceeding.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND SC 35/2016 [2016] NZSC 52  BETWEEN  MICHAEL MARINO Applicant   AND  THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS Respondent    Court: Elias CJ, William Young and O'Regan JJ Counsel: D A Ewen and G K Edgeler for Applicant  D J Perkins and T P Westaway for Respondent Judgment: 6 May 2016  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A Leave to appeal is granted (Marino v The Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2016] NZCA 133).  B The approved question is:  Did the Court of Appeal err in its interpretation of ss 90 and 91 of the Parole Act 2002 or in the application of those sections to the position of the applicant?  REASONS  [1] The Court has granted leave to appeal in another case which touches on the issue raised in the present application, although that case raises the issue as to how a sentence should be structured to deal with the impact of ss 90 and 91 of the Parole Act 2002.1  Booth v R [2016] NZSC 43.  MICHAEL MARINO v THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS [2016] NZSC 52 [6 May 2016]  [2] That appeal is set down for hearing on 5 July 2016. The Registrar should set down the present appeal on the following day or another day in the same week, so that the Court can address the issues at the same time.  [3] The applicant will have completed his prison term by the time of that hearing, which raises the issue of mootness. Counsel should address that issue in their submissions.

[3] I said that in the ordinary course of events I would not consider there to be any basis to suppress Dr Lim's name from publication in the context of this proceeding and noted that Mr Waalkens QC, Dr Lim's counsel, properly conceded that view. I noted also, however, that it was agreed that name suppression should be determined by the District Court in the context of the criminal proceedings against Dr Lim.  [4] I have received a consent memorandum signed by Mr Waalkens QC and Mr La Hood, representing the Medical Council, informing me that Dr Lim has abandoned his appeal against the refusal of the District Court to continue interim name suppression pending his trial. Counsel request revocation of the suppression order in this proceeding.  [5] By consent, therefore, I revoke the non-publication order at [53] of the re­issued judgment, with the result that there is now no prohibition on publication of Dr Lim's name and any particulars which might identify him.  [6] To avoid any doubt, I confirm that the order at [50] of the re-issued judgment, restricting access to the Court file without the leave of a Judge of the Court, remains in force.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2016-485-604973 [2016] NZHC 911  IN THE ESTATE OF HAPERE HAMISH RATANA ( also known as HAPETA HAMISH PITIMOU MATIU RATANA, also known as PETER RATANA)  Deceased  Hearing: On the papers  Counsel: C D Bennett for Applicant  Judgment: 5 May 2016   JUDGMENT OF WILLIAMS J  [1] Rawinia Hiria Bradbury applies for her an order that her father's will be produced.  [2] Ms Bradbury is the daughter of the deceased and one of the three named executors of his will. The other two executors named are Diane Margaretta Ratana and Matiu Ratana. Dianne is the deceased's ex-wife, whose appointment is void pursuant to s 19 of the Wills Act. Matiu is his son. The deceased died on 9 December 2014.  [3] The will is held by Graham Takarangi, a solicitor in Whanganui. He has been instructed by Matiu to act in relation to the will.  [4] Relationships have broken down between the parties. Ms Bradbury says that Matiu and Mr Takarangi have been excluding her from communications regarding the estate. She wants to progress the estate administration, but says that Mr Takarangi refuses to take instructions from her. Rather, he has been instructed by Matiu and Diane, even though she is no longer an executor due to the dissolution of marnage.  Estate ofH H Ratana [2016] NZHC 911 [5 May 2016]  [5] Ms Bradbury's solicitors have repeatedly written to Mr Takarangi without any response, leading to a complaint to the Law Society. Mr Takarangi is now refusing to take any further action on the will, because he has not been paid. He also refuses to hand over the will to Ms Bradbury's solicitors, on the basis that Matiu has instructed him not to. He says that he is not permitted to hand over the file without instructions from Matiu. It also appears that Mr Takarangi has not heard from Matiu for several months.  [6] As such, there is an impasse where Ms Bradbury cannot apply for probate without a copy of the will, and Mr Takarangi cannot take further steps in the matter without instructions from Mr Ratana, who he has not heard from.  [7] Accordingly, it is appropriate for me to make an order pursuant to s 54 of the Administration Act 1969. I make that order in the following terms:  (a)  That the original will of Hapere Hamish Ratana of Whanganui dated 24 July 2002, be produced to the Registry of the High Court situated at Wellington, by Graham Harper Takarangi of Graham Takarangi & Co, Solicitors, ofAotea Chambers, 19 Ridgway Street, Whanganui.   (b)  That the original will be produced as ordered within seven working days from the day on which Graham Harper Takarangi is served with a copy of this order.    Solicitors: Langley Twigg, Napier

It relates to the applicant’s father who is now 92 years old, is in care and suffers from Alzheimer’s.   [2] At issue was a 2014 transaction in which the father transferred farm land in Maraekakaho to the applicant’s brother.  The allegation is the farm was sold at an undervalue to the brother because it did not take into account the potential of irrigation on the property.  The father’s capacity at the time of the transaction is the central issue.   [3] There is, in the context of this litigation, an application for non-party discovery.  The non-parties are lawyers and accountants who advised the father in the transaction.   [4] The present attorneys for the father have now waived privilege in respect of relevant documents held by the legal and accounting advisors and separate counsel for the father now also consents to the waiver of confidentiality.    [5] The non-parties now officially abide the decision in light of these developments.   [6] It is in order therefore for orders for discovery against the non-parties to be made on the papers and without further formality.   [7] In light of the urgency of this matter balanced against the difficulties Mr Mason now faces due to a fire in his offices, I propose to allow 15 working days for discovery to be completed and then the matter will be set down for a judicial telephone conference to finalise timetabling to trial.                ___________________________      Williams J    Solicitors:   G Mason, Barrister, Palmerston North  J P Harding, Solicitor, Waipukurau  G J C Ferguson, Gifford Devine, Hastings  
         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY    CRI-2016-485-34  [2016] NZHC 894       BETWEEN     MATTHEW BROWN  Appellant      AND     NEW ZEALAND POLICE  Respondent       Hearing:     On the papers      Counsel:     M R Brown (in person)  S C Carter for Respondent      Judgment:     5 May 2016         JUDGMENT OF WILLIAMS J  [1] Mr Brown filed a “Notice of appeal” dated 22 April 2016 in which, it seems, he seeks leave to appeal a decision of Judge Davidson in the District Court in Wellington on 6 April 2016 refusing to issue 35 witness summonses in aid of Mr Brown’s defence, and refusing to transfer the trial to Dunedin where Mr Brown lives.   [2] When the transfer application came before Judge Davidson on 6 April 2016, Mr Brown was to join the hearing by AVL but failed to appear at the District Court in Dunedin.  He said he was unaware of the arrangement.  Judge Davidson rather doubted that that was so given the evidence he had seen of an email sent to the defendant about the hearing.   [3] The substantive proceeding involves a charge of criminal trespass in relation to the grounds of Parliament.   [4] Mr Brown’s filings are voluminous, tendentious, and only occasionally relevant.  But the essence of his case in terms of his application for leave is that    Judge Davidson had formerly acted for Mr Brown when he was a practitioner and should have recused himself and that Mr Brown was not given a hearing.   [5] He has now filed a memorandum asking that the application for leave to appeal also be heard by way of AVL.  The Crown abides but notes, given the nature of Mr Brown’s communications with the Court that control over the proceedings by AVL may prove more difficult.   [6] To complicate matters, Mr Brown indicates he has a MacKenzie friend who he wishes to appear with him.  Whether that will be allowed, will of course be a matter for the Judge who hears the application for leave.   [7] I direct that the applicant be permitted to join the hearing of his leave application by AVL.                ___________________________      Williams J    Solicitors:  Crown Solicitor, Wellington  cc:  M R Brown

REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given byBrewer J)  [1] Mr Yoganathan’sapplication for leave to appeal to this Court is granted.  That will be a second appeal against his conviction for driving under the influence of drink to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of a motor vehicle.1 That charge was found proved by Judge R J Russell following a trial in the Manukau District Court on 7 July 2015.2 In terms of s 340(3)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, we do not need to give reasons. Nor does s 237(2)(b) of the  1 Anoffenceunders58(1)(a)ofthe LandTransport Act 1998.  2 Police v Yoganathan [2015] NZDC 14062; MrYoganathan unsuccessfully appealed this decision in Yoganathan v Police [2015]NZHC 2320.  YOGANATHAN v NEWZEALAND POLICE [2016] NZCA169 [4 May2016]  Criminal Procedure Act contemplate this judgment stating the question or questions on which leave is granted. However, we indicate that the issue on the second appeal will be whether a miscarriage of justice occurred by reason of the District Court’s reliance on the evidenceof Dr Parbhu and on theevidential breath test.

He should be given credit for that. He does advise however that he is having some difficulty removing a portacom or out-building, and also arranging sufficient storage for other equipment, within the timeframes required by the Orders.   [2] Mr Williams sought an extension of the time limits for complying with those parts of the Orders.  [3] The Court referred Mr Williams' request to the solicitors for the Council who have responded that the Council would have no objection to an extension of the Orders numbered  (C) and (D) in the Enforcement Orders, and would agree to an additional ten days being allowed.  [4] That extra time seems reasonable to the Court, and we will allow it accordingly.  [5] The orders were formally served on 28 April 2016 so, presently, Mr Williams and the related Respondents are required to comply with Order (C) by 5 May and Order (D) by 12 May 2016.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2016-485-34 [2016] NZHC 867  BETWEEN NEW STYLE HOLDINGS LIMITED Applicant  AND REVOLUTION TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED Respondent  Hearing: 3 May 2016  Counsel: J D Haig for the Applicant No appearance for the Respondent Mr Reid, a director of the Respondent, in attendance  Judgment: 3 May2016   ORAL JUDGMENT OF ASSOCIATE JUDGE SMITH  [1] The applicant applied on 27 January 2016 for an order setting aside a statutory demand issued by the respondent on 13 January 2016.  [2] In response to the setting aside application, Mr Reid, a director of the respondent, filed a document described as a statement of counterclaim. He also filed an affirmation in support.  [3] The application was called before Associate Judge Osborne on 5 April 2016. At that hearing, Mr Dewar, who had previously acted for the respondent, was granted leave to withdraw. Mr Reid attended the hearing ( as he has this morning), and the Associate Judge gave leave to Mr Reid to be heard that day in opposition to the application. The Associate Judge concluded that Mr Reid had told him nothing indicating that the case was appropriate for the company to be granted leave to be represented by its director. The Associate Judge declined leave to the respondent to be represented by its director.  NEW STYLE HOLDINGS LIMITED v REVOLUTION TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED [2016] NZHC 867 [3 May 2016]  [4] The Associate Judge made certain directions on the basis that, if counsel were appointed to act for the respondent within 10 working days, a fixture would be allocated to hear the application on a defended basis. If there was no notification of the appointment of counsel within the 10 working day period, the Associate Judge reserved leave to the applicant to have the proceeding brought on in the next list before me to have the application granted on the papers.  [5] The respondent has not appointed counsel, and the case has accordingly been listed today for hearing.  [6] I have explained today to Mr Reid that he has no right of audience on behalf of the respondent. Nor did he have any entitlement to file Court documents on behalf of the respondent: the privileges of filing documents on behalf of a company and (subject to a very limited number of exceptions which do not apply here) appearing before the High Court on behalf of a company, are reserved to barristers and solicitors.  [7] I have considered the affidavit of Mr Boyko filed in support of the originating application, and on the face of it, it appears that there is a sufficient basis of dispute (primarily concerned with delays in getting the work done) that it is appropriate to make the order setting aside the statutory demand. I make an order accordingly.  [8] I note in passing the reference in Associate Judge Osborne's Minute dated 5 April 2016 that Mr Reid apparently advised that the respondent is insolvent, and that that position would be worsened if the company were required to retain counsel. However that does not in my view justify the grant of audience rights to Mr Reid. I agree with the Associate Judge's decision in that regard.  [9] Mr Haig applies for costs on a 2B basis. disbursements to be fixed by the registrar.   Imakrn:3:7  ,  Associate Judge Smith  
IN THE COURT OFAPPEALOFNEW ZEALAND  CA740/2015 [2016] NZCA 149  BETWEEN AMANDAADELE WHITE First Appellant  ANNE LEOLINE EMILY FREEMAN Second Appellant  AND CHRISTOPHER MAURICE LYNCH First Defendant  STUART GORDON SPENCE Second Defendant  Judgment: 22 April 2016 at 2.30 pm (On the papers)  JUDGMENT OFTHE HON JUSTICE KÓS  The application for review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision declining to accept for filing an application for review is dismissed.     REASONS  [1] The appellants filed an appeal against a decision of Faire J in the High Court.1They applied to dispense with security for costs on appeal.  DeputyRegistrar McGrath declined to dispense with security.  Wild J upheld that decision.2  1 White v Lynch [2015] NZHC 3202. 2 White v Lynch [2016] NZCA78.  WHITE v LYNCH [2016] NZCA149[22April2016]  [2] Theappellants then filed an application under s 61A(2) of the JudicatureAct 1908 for a panel of Judges of this Court to review Wild J’s decision. Deputy Registrar Abraham declined to accept that application for filing.   [3] The appellants now applyfor review of that decision.    Discussion  [4] Deputy Registrar Abraham was plainly correct to decline to accept the application for filing.   [5] Wild J was reviewing a decision of Deputy Registrar McGrath under s 61A(3) of the Judicature Act. As the Supreme Court explained in Reekie v Attorney-General, it is clear from the structure of s 61A that review decisions of a single Judge under s 61A(3) are not subject to further review under s 61A(2).3   Decision  [6] The application for review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision declining to accept for filing an application for review ofWild J’s decision is dismissed.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND SC 5/2016 [2016] NZSC 39  BETWEEN KULBIR SINGHAND NAVJOT KAUR Applicants  AND THECHIEF EXECUTIVE OFTHE MINISTRY OF BUSINESS, INNOVATIONAND EMPLOYMENT Respondent  Court: William Young, Glazebrook and O'Regan JJ  Counsel: R J Hooker forApplicants I C Carter and I M G Clarke for Respondent  Judgment: 19April 2016   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicants are Indian citizens who have been in New Zealand as overstayers since April 2004. They have three children, one of whom (now nearly  12) is a NZ citizen. They are facing deportation and challenged the process and outcome of the consideration by an immigration officer of their cases under s 177 of the Immigration Act 2007. The immigration officer had not cancelled the deportation orders against them as they had hoped.  Their application for review was dismissed by Brewer J1 and their subsequent appeal to the Court of Appeal was also dismissed.2  1 Singh v Chief Executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [2014] NZHC 1916,[2014]NZAR1068.  2 Singh v Chief Executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [2015] NZCA 592,[2016] NZCA592.  KULBIR SINGH AND NAVJOTKAUR vTHE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFTHE MINISTRYOF BUSINESS, INNOVATIONAND EMPLOYMENT[2016] NZSC 39[19April 2016]  [2] The grounds of the proposed appeal are that the Court ofAppeal:  (a)  should have, but did not, interpret s 177 so as to be as consistent as possible with s 27(2) of New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990;   (b)  wrongly took a Wednesbury approach to whether the immigration officer’s decision was unreasonable; and   (c)  should have, but did not, draw an inference adverse to the immigration officer byreason of that officer not giving reasons for his decision.    [3] The applicants’ underlying challenge to deportation seems to be largely premised on the contention that prejudice to the child who is a New Zealand citizen (in the sense that the deportation of her parents and siblings will not be in her best interests) is a trumping consideration. The immigration officer did not accept that it was. There is nothing particularly surprising about that or any other aspect of the decisions of the immigration officer.  [4] Section 177 has been recently amended and we accept there may be points about the interpretation and limits of the new section that would meet the general or public importance test. But we do not see the facts of this case or the arguments that the applicants want to advance as providing a suitable vehicle for addressing such points. We likewise do not see any risk that there will be a miscarriage of justice if leave is not given.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND AUCKLAND REGISTRY CIV-2015-404-2935 [2016] NZHC 723  INTHE MATTER of Part 18 of the High Court Rules, section 52 of the TrusteeAct 1956  BETWEEN PETER MICHAELANICH AND VENESSA FRANCES ANICHAS ATTORNEYS IN RELATIONTO PROPERTY FOR DARINKAANICH Plaintiffs  AND  DARINKAANICH   Defendant   Hearing:  On the papers   Counsel:  SR Morris for plaintiffs   Judgment:  19 April 2016    JUDGMENT OF FAIRE J  This judgment was delivered by me on 19 April 2016 at 3 pm pursuant to Rule 11.5 of the High Court Rules.  Registrar/Deputy Registrar  Date……………  Solicitors: TGTLegal Ltd,Auckland  Anich vAnich [2016] NZHC 723[19April 2016]  [1] The background to this proceeding is set out in the judgment of Associate Judge Doogue dated 11 February 2016. That must also be read in conjunction with his Honour’s minute of 11 March 2016.  [2] The Associate Judge reserved for consideration by a Judge of this Court the question of whether orders in terms of the prayers for relief contained in prayers (a) and (b) of the statement of claim should be made. He quite rightly considered that he did not possess jurisdiction to deal with those matters.  [3] The matter came before me in a Duty Judge list. But for one matter, and having regard to the evidence review by Associate Judge Doogue and which I have also carefully considered, the prayers for relief contained in the statement of claim are, in fact, justified. There is now, as a result of the order for directions as to service, no person who can oppose the making of those orders.  [4] The one concern I had related to a caveat that had been lodged against the property which is the subject of this proceeding. My concern, however, has been fully addressed because counsel advises me that as a result of settlement discussions the caveator has withdrawn the caveat. Counsel has made available to me an historic search copy of the composite computer register which discloses the withdrawal of the caveat having been entered at 12:18 pm on 14April 2016.  Theresult is that there is no person who can oppose the making of the orders sought in the prayers for relief in the statement of claim.  [5] I am satisfied that judgment in accordance with those prayers for relief should be entered. Accordingly, I enter judgment as sought in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the plaintiffs’ statement of claim.  JA Faire J 
IN THE EMPLOYMENT COURT   AUCKLAND   [2016] NZEmpC 41   EMPC 269/2014   IN THE MATTER OF  an application to enforce a compliance   order under s 138 of the Employment   RelationsAct 2000   BETWEEN  JUDITH ANN DAVIDSON   Plaintiff   AND  STEPHEN ROBERT KELLY   Defendant    EMPC 282/2014  AND IN THE MATTER of a challenge and an application to have a matter heard in the Employment Court under s 139 of the Employment Relations Act 2000  AND BETWEEN JUDITH ANN DAVIDSON Plaintiff  AND STEPHEN ROBERT KELLY Defendant  Hearing: (by submissions dated 4 and 15 April 2016)  Appearances: M Beresford, counsel for the plaintiff M Locke, counsel for the defendant  Judgment: 15 April 2016   JUDGMENT NO 2 OF JUDGE B A CORKILL  [1] This judgment is a sequel to a judgment which I issued on 15March 2016.1  Davidson v Kelly [2016] NZEmpC 21.  JUDITH ANN DAVIDSON v STEPHENROBERTKELLYNZEmpC AUCKLAND[2016] NZEmpC 41 [15 April 2016]  [2] The background is fully set out in that judgment, and it is unnecessary to repeat it.  [3] In short, on 4 December 2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle differences, the essence of which was that Mr Kelly would pay Ms Davidson the sum of $300,000 in accordance with an agreed schedule of payments. My first judgment related to a particular default which resulted in the Court making a compliance order directing payment of the sum of $35,000 by 16 March 2016.  [4] Mr Beresford has advised the Court that a further payment of $20,000 was due to be paid by Mr Kelly to Ms Davidson on 31 March 2016, but had not been received.  [5] In reply, Mr Locke says that Mr Kelly has been “energetically pursuing a business transaction that will enable him to rectify the regrettable defaults in payment”. Reference is also made to a medical condition which is affecting him.  Although Mr Locke anticipates a transaction within the next 10 days, he says he can do no more at present and in those circumstances is unable to offer any basis as to why the Court should not accede to the enforcement steps which the plaintiff now requests.  [6] There is no reason why a compliance order should not now be made in terms of the parties’ agreement to that effect.  [7] I make a compliance order directing that Mr Kelly pay Ms Davidson the sum of$20,000 by5.00 pm on 18April2016. If payment is not made, Ms Davidson will be at liberty to enforce payment of the debt.  [8] I reserve any issues as to interest payable from the date of default to the date of payment, and as to costs in respect of Ms Davidson’s application for the above compliance order.

NOTE: PUBLICATION RESTRICTIONS APPLY PURSUANT TO S 19 OF  THE BAIL ACT 2000  IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA47/2016 [2016] NZCA 125  BETWEEN ORURU MARSTERS Appellant  AND THE QUEEN Respondent   Counsel: M Kidd forAppellant M J Lillico for Respondent  Judgment: 13 April 2016 at 3 pm (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for bail is declined.  REASONS  (Given by Miller J)  [1] Mr Marsters moves for bail pending determination of his appeal against conviction.  [2] Under s 14 of the BailAct 2000, the Court must not admit an appellant to bail unless satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the interests of justice require it.  [3] All I have before me are brief memoranda from the appellant's counsel, MrKidd, and a replyfrom the Crown, which points out that Mr Marsters is serving a sentence of 10 years 6 months’ imprisonment for serious offending.  MARSTERS v R [2016] NZCA125[13April 2016]  [4] The memoranda from Mr Kidd assert that Mr Marsters has a strong case, but there is no supporting justification for that claim. Mr Marsters says a witness has recanted, but counsel advised that he himself has not read the transcript. It must be said that counsel's first memorandum conveys the clear impression that he had not then read s 14 either.  [5] Mr Marsters also says that he wants bail on account of the health needs of his wife and a relative. There is no evidence of these matters, counsel having declined an invitation to file some.  [6] In the circumstances the bail application has no prospects of success. It is declined.  Solicitors: Kidd Legal,Auckland forAppellant Crown LawOffice,Wellingtonfor Respondent

B  The approved question is:    Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that the High Court had no jurisdiction (or power) to exclude the challenged evidence obtained by search of the applicant’s premises and, if so, should the challenged evidence be excluded in this proceeding?  KARL LESLIE RAYMOND MARWOOD v THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE [2016] NZSC 36 [11 April 2016]  REASONS  [1] The issues arising in this appeal have some commonality with those arising in R v A(SC 12/2016) for which leave was given on 15 March 2016 and which is due to be heard on 16 June 2016.1 For this reason it would be convenient to the Court for the present appeal to be heard at or near the same time as R vA. We therefore set the present appeal down for hearing on 16 June 2016, immediately after RvA, with provision for the hearing to continue into 17 June 2016 if necessary.

B There is no order for costs.  REASONS  [1] The applicant, Mr Stockman, asks the Court to recall its judgment in Stockman v New Zealand Association of Counsellors Inc,1 in which the Court declined Mr Stockman’s application for leave to appeal. The ground of the recall application is that the Court failed to give reasons for its refusal, as required by s 16 of the Supreme Court Act 2003.  Stockman v New Zealand Association of Counsellors Inc [2016] NZSC18.  PETER GERARD STOCKMAN v NEWZEALAND ASSOCIATION OF COUNSELLORS INCORPORATED [2016] NZSC 35 [7April 2016]  [2] Section 16 provides:  Court to state reasons for refusalto give leave  (1)  The Supreme Court must state its reasons for refusing to give leave to appeal to it.   (2)  The reasons may be stated briefly, and may be stated in generalterms only.    [3] In refusing leave, the Court stated that it was not satisfied that it was necessary in the interests of justice that it hear and determine the appeal because it did not consider that any issue of public or general importance was raised, or that there was any appearance of a miscarriage of justice.  Those were its reasons for declining leave, and they meet the requirements of s 16.  [4] Mr Stockman has raised nothing which justifies recall of the Court’s judgment. Accordingly the application for recall is dismissed. There is no order for costs.  Solicitors: Morrison Kent, Wellington for Respondent  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY   CIV 2016-485-159   [2016] NZHC 589   IN THE ESTATE  of WILLIAM EDWARD GATES   COLIN ROBERT GATES, EDWARD   ARTHUR GATES AND ALISTER   DAVID ARGYLE   Applicants   On the papers    Judgment: 7 April 2016  JUDGMENT OF MALLON J  [1] An application is made under s 14 of the Wills Act 2007 for an order declaring that a document is the valid will of William Edward Gates, a deceased person. The application is made because the will does not comply with s 11 (4) of the Wills Act 2007 in that the witnesses to Mr Gates' signature were not together when he signed the document or acknowledged that he had signed the document earlier.  [2] The document amends Mr Gates' earlier will dated 15 August 2013. That will was duly executed at the offices ofArgyle Welsh Finnigan, a firm of solicitors in Ashburton. Under that will the beneficiaries of Mr Gates' estate were his two sons, Colin and Edward. They were also the executors of his estate, together with Alister Argyle, solicitor.  [3] The document is a copy of the above will with handwritten amendments. The amendments are as follows:  (a)  The date is crossed out and the date of 24 April 2014 is inserted.   (b)  The foot of the first page of the will is marked "P.T.O".   ( c) On the second page (noted as such) it is stated: "I would like to bequeath $1000 to St Johns Ambulance. Also I would like to bequeath $1000 to the Cancer society".    ESTATE OF GATES [2016] NZHC 589 [7 April 2016]  [4] An affidavit has been filed by Jack Haii. He deposes that he visited Mr Gates in Ashburton Hospital on about 24 April 2014 when Mr Gates produced the document and asked that he sign it as a witness. Mr Hart did so. There was no other witness at this time. He believes the handwritten additions accurately reflect Mr Gates' testamentary intention because Mr Gates said that he had altered his will by including legacies of $1,000 to ce1iain charities he intended to benefit.  [5] An affidavit has also been filed by Brendon Soal. He was a patient in Ashburton Hospital and was placed in the same room as Mr Gates. He had known Mr Gates for 35 years. Mr Gates was anxious to have a new will completed. On 24 April 2014 Mr Gates produced the document and asked Mr Soal to sign it as one of the witnesses to his will. Mr Gates had already signed the will. Mr Soal was familiar with Mr Gates' signature and knew the signature on the document to be that of Mr Gates. Mr Soal signed the document on the first page but is unable to say whether the handwritten additions on the second page were present as he was not asked to sign that page. There was no other witness present at this time.  [6] Mr Gates' two sons, Colin and Edward, have provided their consent to an order declaring the document to be valid.  [7] I am satisfied on the evidence that the document expresses Mr Gates' testamentary intention. I declare the document to be a valid will. The draft order /  that has been filed can be issued.

[2] The applicant has now filed a further recall application; this time addressed to the 10 March 2016 decision.  This application is also dismissed.

REASONS  [1] The applicant, Mr Siemer, challenges two minutes refusing his requests for access to court documents, being  (a) aminute ofWilliam YoungJdated 29 October2015 denyingarequest for access to documents filed in relation to SC 46/2015; and  RICHARD JOHN CRESER v JANINE CRESER [2016] NZSC 28 [22 March 2016]  (b) a minute of O’Regan J dated 15 February 2016 which denied MrSiemer’s requests for access to court documents dated 26 December 2015 and 17 January 2016.  [2] The decisions in question were made in accordance with the procedure described in Greer v Smith.1 One of Mr Siemer’s applications, in respect of the minute of William Young J, proceeds on the basis that his decision may be discharged or varied under s 28(3) of the Supreme Court Act 2003. For the reasons explained in Greer v Smith we do not agree.2 The other, in respect of O’Regan J’s minute, purports to be by way of “appeal/review”.3 There is, however, no right of review or appeal.  We also see no reason why the original decisions should not stand.

         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY    CRI-2014-085-006779  [2016] NZHC 486       UNDER     Section 80F(1) of the Sentencing Act 2002      BETWEEN     DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS  Applicant      AND     ANNETTE ALICIA HOLDEN  Respondent       Hearing:     22 March 2016      Counsel:     S C Carter for Applicant  Respondent in person      Judgment:     22 March 2016         JUDGMENT OF COLLINS J    [1] The Department of Corrections (the Department) has applied to cancel the sentence of home detention, which I imposed on Ms Holden on 24 November 2015.1   [2] The sentence of home detention will expire on 23 May 2016.     [3] The Department has made the application because Ms Holden has been offered a placement in a residential rehabilitation facility.  Ms Holden would not be able to undertake electronic monitoring while attending a residential rehabilitation programme.     [4] I have therefore decided to accede to the Department’s request that Ms Holden’s sentence of home detention be cancelled to allow her to engage in the residential rehabilitation programme.    1  R v Holden [2015] NZHC 2937.  [5] As the residential rehabilitation programme will conclude on 20 May 2016, I see no point in seeking a further pre-sentence report at the completion of the residential rehabilitation programme.   [6] I have warned Ms Holden that any failure on her part to comply with the terms of the residential rehabilitation programme will result in her appearing before me again.            ________________________   D B Collins J    Solicitors:   Crown Solicitor, Wellington for Applicant  
         IN THE DISTRICT COURT  AT HAMILTON    CRI-2014-019-002934    [2016] NZDC 4577       THE QUEEN        v        NICHOLAS WARD           Hearing:     17 March 2016      Appearances:     T Tran for the Crown  R Laybourn for the Defendant       Judgment:     17 March 2016         NOTES OF JUDGE R G MARSHALL ON SENTENCING      [1] Mr Ward, I gave you the sentence indication on 15 December last year and I applied a reasonably novel approach to that sentencing where I sentenced you on a number of charges, but not the main charge of supplying methamphetamine, to home detention and gave you an opportunity of attending Odyssey House.  That has not worked out.  There has been a setback and now it falls to me to sentence you on the charge of supplying methamphetamine.   [2] The Crown have suggested a starting point of four to four and a half years, it being in the lower band 2 of R v Fatu (2005) 22 CRNZ 524 (CA).  That range is three to nine years.  I agree with that but intend to take the lower end of that, of four years.  I apply an uplift of six months due to recent serious relevant previous convictions which left me with four years six months. From that I give you allowance of six months for your restricted bail conditions and also your endeavour to partially complete or your partial completion of rehabilitation and, by way of   encouragement, for you to continue along that path in future for which you have a determination.     [3] That leaves me with an end starting point of four years’ imprisonment.  For that I give you a credit of 20 percent for your guilty plea and acknowledgement of responsibility.  That, in my view, once again applying a generous credit is 10 months, which brings me back to an end sentence of three years and two months on the charge of supplying methamphetamine.

BEFORE THE ENVIRONMENT COURT  Decision No. [2016] NZEnvC 0~-g  IN THE MATTER  ofan appeal under Section 325 ofthe   Resource Management Act 1991 (the   Act)   BETWEEN  GA VIN LESLIE JOHNSON   (ENV-2015-AKL-000117)   Appellant    AND AUCKLAND COUNCIL  Respondent Hearing at: Auckland, 16 March 2016 Court: Environment Judge JA Smith Appearances: Mr v Tamatea for the respondent Council  Mr G Johnson for himself Date of Determination: 16 March 2016  ORAL DETERMINATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT COURT  A. The abatement notices dated 18 and 19 August 2015 are cancelled by consent.  B. No costs were sought and there is no order for costs.   The parties are encouraged to try and resolve the underlying issues by  \ agreement.   2  REASONS FOR DECISION  Introduction  [1] This matter relates to two appeals from abatement notices issued by the Council on 18 and 19 August 2015. They relate to a property at 2 Couldrey Street Eden Terrace, Auckland and the abatement notices relate to certain alleged breaches of development controls for the permitted activities of residential units.  Progress  [2] Prior to hearing formal submissions from the parties Mr Tamatea and Mr Johnson held discussions. As a result the Council has applied to cancel the abatement notices (it would also cancel these of its own volition). Neither party has sought orders for costs.  [3] On this basis it is not necessary for the Court to address the particular abatement notices or the merits ofthe appeal in any particular degree.  [4] I do point out that it is important when issuing abatement notices that the reasoning for the abatement notice and the outcome sought are transparent within the notice. Given the complexity of the Auckland Plan it is necessary to set out all of the various provisions that make the ~ctivity require a consent, especially when it is a permitted activity in itself. Also, it is important to ensure that the outcome sought in terms ofthe abatement notice reflect the breaches that are alleged.  [5] The Court need not comment any further, given that in the end it was not required to reach any decision as to whether these particular notices were appropriate for confirmation.  Final comment  [6] As a result both abatement notices are cancelled by consent and neither party seeks costs and accordingly there is no order for costs. I encourage the parties to try and resolve the underlying issues without recourse back to the courts.

         IN THE DISTRICT COURT AT WHANGAREI    CIV-2013-011-000020    [2016] NZDC 4246       BETWEEN     SELINA NEIGHBOURS  Plaintiff      AND     BRIAN STUTT  Defendant       Hearing:     8 March 2016      Appearances:     Mr R Mark for the Plaintiff  No appearance by the Defendant - Plaintiff on the Counterclaim      Judgment:     16 March 2016         RESERVED DECISION ON COUNTERCLAIM OF JUDGE D J McDONALD        [1] I have already given a decision in relation to Ms Neighbours, the Plaintiff, claim.  I do not propose to repeat the history of the proceedings and other matters raised in that decision.   [2] This decision only relates to the counterclaim filed by Mr Stutt.  Mr Stutt, the Defendant, did not pay the setting down fee for the counterclaim.  He did not file or provide any briefs of evidence in support of the counterclaim in terms of the directions made.  He did not appear at the hearing on 8 March 2016.     [3] The Plaintiff seeks dismissal of the counterclaim.  I consider that it is appropriate that the counterclaim be dismissed.  The Defendant, Mr Stutt, did not appear at the hearing.  Rule 15.2 allows for dismissal for want of prosecution of a counterclaim.     [4] The other two matters raised may not of themselves lead to a dismissal.  However they add to the failure of the Defendant to prosecute his counterclaim.    Result  [5] The counterclaim is dismissed.      Costs   [6] If the Plaintiff seeks costs on the dismissal of the counterclaim she is to file a memorandum within ten days of today’s date setting out the reasons why costs should be awarded, the Plaintiff having succeeded in her substantial claim upon which I awarded costs, and the amount sought.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 28/2015 [2016] NZSC 23   BETWEEN  BRUCE BRENDONVAN ESSEN First Applicant   JASON JAMES PATTERSON Second Applicant   AND  THEATTORNEY-GENERAL First Respondent   PETER JAMES GIBBONS Second Respondent   GRAEME JOHN SCOTT Third Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, William Young and Glazebrook JJ   Counsel:  A Shaw for Applicants No appearance for First Respondent D P Robinson for Second and Third Respondents   Judgment:  15 March 2016    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  We certify that, were it not for s 45(2) of the Legal Services Act 2011, the applicants would have been ordered to pay the second and third respondents jointly costs of $2,500.  REASONS  [1] The applicants unsuccessfully sought leave to appeal.1 They were legally aided and thus have qualified protection against costs under s 45 of the Legal Services Act 2011. It is not suggested that an order against them would be  Van Essen v Attorney-General [2015] NZSC 166.  BRUCE BRENDON VAN ESSEN vTHE ATTORNEY-GENERAL[2016] NZSC 23[15 March 2016]  appropriate under s 45(2) but the respondents seek a certificate under s 45(5) which provides:  If, because of this section, no order for costs is made against the aided person, an order may be made specifying what order for costs would have been made against that person with respect to the proceedings if this section had not affected that person’s liability.  [2] The applicants by their counsel initially suggested that a certificate under s 45(5) cannot be given unless the s 45(3) criteria for an award of costs have been satisfied.2 That, however, is not the scheme of the section, as counsel in effect acknowledged in a supplementary submission. In this submission, counsel argued that an order under s 45(5) requires the exercise of a discretion and that no adequate basis has been advanced for the discretion to be exercised in favour of the respondents.  [3] If it were not for s 45(2), an order for costs in the sum of $2,500 would have been made against the applicants.3 That this is so provides a logical basis for the making of the order which is sought by the respondents and we see no reason why such an order should not be made.  Solicitors: Ord Legal,WellingtonforApplicants GallawayCookAllan, Dunedinfor Second andThird Respondents  2 There is authority for this view, see SvI HC Hamilton CIV-2009-419-139, 21 August 2009.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 52/2009   SC 53/2009   [2016] NZSC 25   BETWEEN  JOHN KENNETH SLAVICH   Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN   Respondent   Court:  Elias CJ, William Young, Glazebrook, Arnold and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person   Judgment:  15 March 2016    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The applications by Mr Slavich for recall of the judgments of this Court of 10 August 2009 and 10 February 2016 and the minute of 6 November 2012 are dismissed.   REASONS  [1] Mr Slavich suggests that the Court should recall, of its own motion, the judgment of 10 February 20161 which dismissed his recall application in respect of the judgment of 18 December 2015 which dismissed two leave applications.2 We propose to treat this as a recall application. He has also complained that other applications have not been addressed. They are:  (a) Recall application dated 8 April 20133 in relation to the judgment of the Court of 10 August 2009 dismissing his application for leave to  1 Slavich v R [2016] NZSC 5. 2 Slavich v R [2015] NZSC 195. 3 The coversheet hasthe date 8April 2012but it isdated8April 2013.  JOHN KENNETH SLAVICH v R [2016] NZSC 25[15March2016]  appeal against the dismissal of his conviction appeal4 and another application of 2 March 2015 dealing with the same matter; and  (b) Afurther recall application dated 31 March 2014 seeking the recallof the 10 August 2009 judgment and what we take to be a minute of 6 November 2012.  [2] Primarily in issue is the judgment of the Court of 10 August 2009.5 A first recall application in respect of it was dismissed on 13 September 2011. A second recall application was dismissed by minute of 22 September 2011. A third recall application was dismissed in the minute of 6 November 2012 to which we have referred. This prompted further complaints from Mr Slavich which were addressed and rejected in a minute of 29 January 2013.  [3] There are now six formal judgments of this Court which are addressed, more or less directly, to whether Mr Slavich should be granted leave to appeal his conviction.6 This is in addition to the three minutes to which we have referred. Associated satellite litigation has resulted in a further seven judgments.7 The recall applications of 8 April 2013 and 31 March 2014 are, by our count, the fourth and fifth, respectively, in relation to the 10 August 2009 judgment. Theyare an abuse of process and are dismissed (as is, consequentially, the application of 2 March 2015).   [4] Mr Slavich’s complaints about the judgment of 10 February 2016 do not engage with the reasons why the Court concluded that it had no jurisdiction to hear the appeals proposed in his April2012 applications. Accordingly, wedo not propose to recall this judgment.  4 Slavich v R [2009] NZSC 87.  5 Slavich v R [2009] NZSC 87.  6 Slavich v R [2009] NZSC 87; Slavich v R [2011] NZSC 103; Slavich v R [2011] NZSC 131; Slavich v R [2015] NZSC 174; Slavich v R [2015] NZSC195; and Slavich v R [2016] NZSC5.  7 Slavich v R [2011] NZSC 139; Slavich v Attorney-General [2013] NZSC 130; Slavich v Attorney-General [2014] NZSC 22; Slavich v Attorney-General [2014] NZSC 46; Slavich v Judges of the Supreme Court [2015] NZSC 125; Slavich v Judges of the Supreme Court [2015] NZSC130; and Slavich v Judges of the Supreme Court [2015]NZSC 151.

REASONS  [1] The applicant was found guilty by a jury of sexual offending (rape and indecent assault) against three of his children and the daughter of a neighbour and of injuring one of them with intent to injure. The charges related to events which occurred between 1972 and 1983. One of the complainants made a complaint to a social worker in 1984. Formal complaints to the police were made in December 2004 as well as May and June 2005. The applicant was by then living in Australia.  There were substantial delays with extradition (apparently the result of the ill-health  K (SC 133/2015)v R [2016] NZSC 26[15March 2016]  of the responsible police officer) and the applicant was not approached over the allegations until October 2011.   [2] The applicant’s trial preceded the release of the judgment of this Court in CTv R and the trial Judge did not give the jury a warning under s 122 of the EvidenceAct 2006.1  [3] The applicant’s conviction appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.2 That Court concluded that, despite the delays, the applicant had received a fair trial.3 And although the Court recognised that the Judge ought to have given a s 122 warning, it concluded that failure to do so had not resulted in a miscarriage of justice.4  [4] The applicant wishes to challenge the conclusions reached by the Court of Appeal in the two respects just mentioned. That Court, however, gave both points extremely careful and thorough consideration. The applicant’s submissions do not identify any error in the approach taken and we see no appearance of a miscarriage of justice. As well, there is no point of public or general importance raised by the proposed appeal.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND WELLINGTON REGISTRY CIV-2016-485-97 [2016] NZHC 446  UNDER section 290 of the Companies Act 1993 IN THE MATTER of an application to set aside statutory demand BETWEEN CUDBY & MEADE LIMITED Applicant AND DAVID STEVENS  Respondent Hearing: 15 March 2016 Counsel: No appearance for the Applicant  D G Dewar for the Respondent Judgment: 15 March 2016  ORAL JUDGMENT OF ASSOCIATE JUDGE SMITH  [1] On 13 January 2016 Mr Harry Memelink purported to file on behalf of the applicant (Cudby & Meade) an application to set aside a statutory demand which Mr Stevens had served on Cudby & Meade on 18 December 2015.  [2] The application should not have been accepted for filing by the registrar. As Cooke J noted in Re G J Mannix, “a company has no right to be represented in the conduct of a case in Court except by a barrister”.1 The learned Judge went on to note that “there is a cognate rule that, apart from statutory exceptions, a corporation has no right to bring or carry on proceedings in a Court except by a solicitor. This refers  to the filing of documents, writs, statements of defence, notices of appeal, etc….”2  [3] The application, then, was defective from the outset.  1 Re G J Mannix [1984] 1 NZLR 309 (CA) at 310. 2 At 311.  CUDBY & MEADE LIMITED v DAVID STEVENS [2016] NZHC 446 [15 March 2016]  [4] The application was also out of time. Under s 290(2) of the Companies Act 1993 (the Act), an application to set aside a statutory demand is required to be filed and served within ten working days of the date of service of the demand. In this case, there are issues over when the application to set aside was served, but I do not need to consider them further. The application itself was not filed in Court until one day after the ten working day period allowed for filing had expired.  [5] Under s 290(3) of the Act, the Court has no power to extend the time for the filing and service of the setting aside application.  [6] For the foregoing reasons, the purported application to set aside the statutory demand is dismissed. There will be an order for costs in Mr Stevens’favour on a 2B basis, plus disbursements as fixed by the registrar.

         IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY    CRI 2016-485-16  [2016] NZHC 448       BETWEEN     NEIL MARTIN CLARKE  Appellant      AND     DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS  Respondent       Hearing:     15 March 2016      Counsel:     Appellant in Person  A R T Garrick for Respondent      Judgment:     15 March 2016         JUDGMENT OF SIMON FRANCE J    [1] Mr Clarke appeals the refusal of the District Court to cancel the remaining part of a 10 month home detention sentence to which Mr Clarke is subject.  Mr Clarke wants greater capacity to work than is being afforded him by those administering his home detention sentence.  There have been numerous challenges to the sentence and its administration.  The history of them is summarised in the judgment under appeal and I do not repeat it.1   [2] There is no appeal right from this decision.  If the application is granted and a new sentence imposed, that may be appealed.2  But a refusal is not appealable.  It just means the existing sentence continues.  That sentence in this case has already been the subject of an unsuccessful appeal to this Court and unsuccessful application to the Court of Appeal for leave to bring a further appeal.    1  Department of Corrections v Clarke [2016] NZDC 3537.  2  Sentencing Act 2002, s 80M.  [3] Had there been jurisdiction, I would have declined the appeal:   (a) there is only three weeks to go on the sentence;   (b) the proposed alternative sentence of community detention affords inadequate protection without other aspects such as a sentence of supervision;   (c) the remaining period of the existing sentence is already itself a substituted sentence;   (d) the statutory test in s 80F(1)(d)(ii) is not made out.  I am not satisfied the existing sentence is no longer necessary in the interests of the community.  It is a sentence confirmed on appeal, and there is nothing in the present situation that merits cancelling it.  It should be served in the normal way.    [4] The appeal is declined for lack of jurisdiction.        ______________________________  Simon France J      
IN THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS AUTHORITY WELLINGTON  [2016] NZERA Wellington 32 5605025  BETWEEN BROADSPECTRUM (NEW ZEALAND) LIMITED (formally TRANSFIELD SERVICES (NEW ZEALAND) LIMITED) Applicant  AND JASON NATHAN Respondent  Member of Authority: M B Loftus  Representatives: Richard Upton, Counsel for Applicant Jason Nathan, on his own behalf  Submission received: 25 February and 4 March 2016 from Applicant 2 March 2016 from Respondent  Determination: 11 March 2016   COSTS DETERMINATION OF THE AUTHORITY  [1] On 1 February 2016 I issued a determination1 in which I found in favour of Broadspectrum with respect to a dispute about where it could employ Mr Nathan following an earlier order he be reinstated.2  [2] Costs were reserved and Broadspectrum, as the successful party, now seeks a contribution toward its costs.  [3] It is accepted that in the normal course of events costs follow the event and normally the Authority will use a daily tariff approach when addressing such a claim.3 The normal starting point is $3,500 per day and from there adjustment may be made depending on the circumstances.  1 [2016] NZERA Wellington 15 2 Jason Nathan v Transfield Services (New Zealand) Limited [2015] NZERA Wellington 120 3 refer PBO Ltd (formerly Rush Security Ltd) v Da Cruz [2005] ERNZ 808  [4] The investigation meeting took approximately half a day which would mean, applying the above approach, an award in the order of $1750. That is what Broadspectrum seeks, along with reimbursement of its filing fee. The total sought is $1,821.56.  [5] Mr Nathan’s response is just over two pages. That said all but three lines is devoted to assertions Broadspectrum has failed to properly pay amounts awarded in the determination that ordered his reinstatement.4 He goes on to propose these payments be used to offset or contribute toward any Costs that I owe regarding the second Determination February 2016.  [6] On behalf of Broadspectrum Mr Upton responds with:  … even if Broadspectrum does owe him remuneration (which is  denied) then that is an entirely separate issue to whatever costs Mr Nathan may owe to Broadspectrum as a result of his unsuccessful proceedings. The former has no relevance to the latter.  [7] Mr Upton is correct. If, as Mr Nathan alleges, Broadspectrum has failed to adhere to the earlier orders that should be addressed via a compliance application. It cannot be integrated with this given it is a stand-alone proceeding.  [8] I therefore choose to apply the normal tariff approach given that is what is sought and the absence of a valid argument as to why I should not do so. The filing fee is a given.  [9] Accordingly I order Mr Nathan pay Broadspectrum (New Zealand) Limited the sum of $1,821.56 (one thousand, eight hundred twenty one dollars and fifty six cents) as a contribution toward the costs it incurred in pursuing its successful application.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND  CA540/2015 [2016] NZCA 52  BETWEEN  AUGUSTINE LAU Appellant   AND  DALUN LI First Respondent   LIPING CHEN Second Respondent   BARFOOT & THOMPSON LIMITED Third Respondent   CHARLES HSU Fourth Respondent   Court:  Harrison, Stevens and Cooper JJ   Counsel:  Appellant in person D L C Liu for First and Second Respondents M S R Lucas for Third and Fourth Respondents   Judgment:  9 March 2016 at 2:30 pm    (On the papers)   JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  REASONS OF THE COURT  (Given by Cooper J)  LAU v LI [2016] NZCA 52 [9 March 2016]  [1] This appeal purports to challenge various aspects of the judgment of Associate Judge Christiansen delivered on 1 September 2015.1  [2] In that judgment, the Associate Judge dealt with applications for security for costs and provision of initial disclosure, and a strike-out application made by the appellant.  [3] It is plain that all of the applications before the Associate Judge were interlocutory applications, and that in dealing with them the Judge was exercising the powers of a High Court Judge sitting in chambers.2  [4] That being the case, any challenge to the judgment should have been by way of an application for review under s 26P(1) of the Judicature Act 1908, and not by appeal to this Court. The appellant was offered an opportunity to make submissions to the contrary. His submission of 25 February 2016 did not respond to the jurisdictional issue but effectively expressed a preference that the matter be heard as an appeal in this Court.  It appears that some of the reasons for his preference may be based on a misapprehension that a review would be dealt with by Associate Judge Christiansen. That of course is not the case; the review would be conducted by a Judge of the High Court.  [5] Any application for review would now need to be preceded by an application to extend the time for making the application having regard to the time limits in r 2.3(2) of the High Court Rules.  [6] However, we are satisfied that this Court does not have jurisdiction to deal with the purported appeal.  On that basis, the appeal is dismissed.  [7] There will be no order as to costs.

That involved the penetration of the complainant’s vagina with your fingers on apparently three occasions.   [2] Earlier this year, on 22 January 2016, you asked the Court for an indication as to the likely sentence that would be imposed in the event that you were to accept responsibility for what had happened and to plead guilty.   [3] His Honour Judge Andrée Wiltens heard argument put before him from your counsel and also counsel for the Crown and he indicated to you that the starting point in terms of your offending would be a period of four-and-a-half years’ imprisonment.  He indicated to you, though, that if you were prepared to plead guilty at this point, you would receive a discount of 25 percent on that sentence.   [4] You subsequently accepted the indication given by Judge Andrée Wiltens and it simply remains for me today to impose the ultimate sentence.   [5] Ms Te Whata, on your behalf, has filed brief submissions and it is accepted now that I should give you that discount, but unfortunately there is not much else that I can take into account.  I was disturbed to read the pre-sentence report which indicated that, even at this late stage, you were not accepting responsibility for what had occurred.  However, Ms Te Whata assures me this morning that that must be a misinterpretation by the report-writer and that you are indeed accepting responsibility.   [6] I have before me now, which was not before the Court earlier, a victim impact statement and that simply confirms what the Court invariably finds in this type of case and that is the long-felt emotional and psychological harm that victims of sexual abuse suffer from long after the actual events themselves.   [7] In reality I have to carry out a mathematical exercise.  From the starting point of four-and-a-half years’ imprisonment, which you have accepted, I give you the maximum discount of 25 percent, as indicated by Judge Andrée Wiltens and fix the final sentence of one of three years and four months’ imprisonment.   [8] You are sentenced to three years and four months’ imprisonment on this charge accordingly.                C S Blackie  District Court Judge  
IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  WELLINGTON REGISTRY   CIV-2015-485-484   [2016] NZHC 379   UNDER  the Defamation Act 1992   BETWEEN  KAREN FRANCES ARNOLD   Plaintiff   AND  FAIRFAX NEW ZEALAND LIMITED   First Defendant   TIMOTHY RICHARD SHAD BOLT   Second Defendant   On the papers    Counsel: PA McKnight and A J Romanos for Plaintiff R K P Stewart and R G Cahn for First Defendant F E Geiringer for Second Defendant  Judgment: 8 March 2016  JUDGMENT OF CLIFFORD J (COSTS)  [1] It is not unusual for a variety of orders to be sought in an interlocutory application. The fact that some only of those orders may be sought as against all parties, and others as regards one or some only of those parties, does not in my view mean that there is more than one application to be considered from a costs perspective. On that basis:  (a)  I accept Mr Geiringer's memorandum filed on 6 March 2016;   (b)  I do not accept the analysis that the second defendant responded to two separate applications;    ARNOLD v FAIRFAX NEW ZEALAND LIMITED [2016] NZHC 379 [8 March 2016)  (c)  I consider that a 25 per cent discount over-states Ms Arnold's limited   success;   ( d) I consider that a 12.5 per cent reduction reflects that limited success.    [2] I therefore dete1mine:  (a)  that the plaintiff will pay costs of $5,908.00 to the first defendant in respect of the plaintiff's interlocutory application heard on 2 February 2016;and   (b)  that the plaintiff will pay costs of $5,167.50 to the second defendant.    [3] High Comi Rule 14.8 is clear. Costs on interlocutory applications must be fixed in accordance with the Rules when the application is determined and become payable when they are fixed, in the absence of "special reasons to the contrary". No such special reasons have been advanced. The rule will therefore apply on its terms. I do not understand that the concepts of "costs in any event" and "costs in the proceedings" feature in this Comi's Rules.

[2] The offending occurred in two separate lots and I have detailed that in the comments I made to you on 21 January when I gave you the sentence indication.  I have comprehensively set out there.  The sentence indication which you accepted was an overall sentence of four years’ imprisonment including the deductions that you would get for the pleas of guilty that you have been entered.   [3] Since that time I have received a considerable amount of information from the probation officer.  I have read the letter that you have written and I have read the submissions that the lawyers have made.  It is to be hoped, Mr Teddy, that as you say approaching the age of 50 you might have decided that it is time to call this sort of a   lifestyle quits.  Only you will know that.  I accept that you are genuine in your remorse for what has happened and also for the difficulty that you find yourself in and that you have placed your friends and family in as a result of the sentencing exercise today.  I have considered whether there should be a further discount but bearing in mind that there was no uplift for your prior multiple offending in the past I have decided to leave it where it is.   [4] I have taken into account all of the provisions of the Sentencing Act 2002 and overall the sentence indication that I gave you will be the sentence imposed upon you.  In relation to the offering to supply you will be sentenced to four years’ imprisonment.  On the other three charges you will be sentenced to three years’ imprisonment on each.  All terms are concurrent, running together, making a total of four years.  The four years is made up out of totality rather than charge by charge and that is the way that I have attributed the sentence to each of the offences.   [5] As I have already said, I can tell you are remorseful and hopefully a little more insightful.  That cannot change the outcome but hopefully when you are released you continue on with the progress that you have made up until now and we see the last of you.   [6] Your sentence of community work is cancelled.              G A Rea  District Court Judge

[2] Reign has been in their care effectively since birth.  The birth mother, Darien Foster, signed a consent to adopt on 10th August 2015.   [3] On 23 December 2015 Child, Youth and Family reported very strongly in favour of this couple being able to adopt Reign.   [4] The matter comes before me today and I am obliged, pursuant to s 5 Adoption Act 1955, to grant an interim order at first instance unless special circumstances make it desirable that it should be made final at first instance.  Unfortunately, looking at the authorities available to me, there are no such exceptional circumstances in this case, and accordingly I am left being only able to make an interim adoption order at this time.   [5] However, I have indicated to counsel for Mr and Mrs Taiamoni, Ms Kennedy, that a simple application and memorandum can be drawn to my attention within six months and put to me in chambers for me to make final orders.  At that time I will note that the child’s name will be changed for the birth certificate purposes to Billie Moana Taiamoni.                A B Lendrum  Family Court Judge

A family group conference in respect of these proceedings was held on 29 February. That conference was attended by both parents, although Mr MW, VW’s father, attended by telephone. The conference was also attended by Ms Jack, who is Court-appointed counsel for VW.  [2] Agreement was reached at the conference that VW is a child in need of care and protection. The conference acknowledged that the overall goal was for VW to be in the care of her whanau and that there was no realistic possibility of VW returning to the full-time care of either parent.  [3] The affidavit evidence provided confirms that there are ample grounds for the making of this declaration. VW’s mother, Ms AH, has an extensive history with Child, Youth and Family and an involvement with Youth Justice. There are also concerns in relation to Ms AH’s mental health. Both parents have criminal records and have been involved in a turbulent relationship involving instability and domestic violence.  Another child, P, was removed from their care in 2012.  [4] I am satisfied that the grounds are made out for the making of a declaration and accordingly I make the following orders:  (a)  I make a declaration that VW is a child in need of care and protection pursuant to s 14(1)(a), (b) and (f) Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989.   (b)  I adjourn these proceedings to 13 April 2016 at 11.15 am for the filing of a plan and report.   (c)  The s 78 order is to continue.    J P Geoghegan Family Court Judge

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 2/2016   [2016] NZSC 18   BETWEEN  PETER GERARD STOCKMAN   Applicant   AND  NEW ZEALANDASSOCIATION OF   COUNSELLORS INCORPORATED   Respondent   Court:  William Young, Glazebrook and Arnold JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person   C Heaton for Respondent   Judgment:  29 February 2016     JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B There is no order for costs.    REASONS  [1] The respondent, the New Zealand Association of Counsellors Inc, filed an appeal against a decision of Peters J in which the Judge upheld an application for judicial review by the applicant, Mr Stockman.1 The application was against a decision by the Association to exclude certain evidence that was relevant to a complaint made by Mr Stockman to the Association against another counsellor.   [2] Before hearing, the Association abandoned its appeal. Mr Stockman then applied for an order of indemnity costs against the Association and sought leave to  Stockman v New Zealand Association of Counsellors Inc [2013] NZHC 2267.  PETER GERARD STOCKMAN v NEWZEALAND ASSOCIATION OF COUNSELLORS INCORPORATED [2016] NZSC 18 [29February2016]  file additional evidence to support his claim. In the alternative, Mr Stockman sought an award of costs for a standard appeal. The Court of Appeal declined the applications to adduce further evidence and for indemnity costs, but awarded MrStockman costs of $4,460 for standard appeal, reflecting the fact that he was represented by counsel in the appeal up until the time of its abandonment.2  [3] Mr Stockman then applied to the Court of Appeal to recall its judgment, on the basis that the Court had not been impartial in considering his applications because he was, by that stage, acting for himself. Mr Stockman’s recall application was declined.3 Mr Stockman now asks this Court to give leave to appeal against that decision. The Association has advised that it does not wish to be heard on the application and abides the decision of the Court.  [4] We are not satisfied that it necessary in the interests of justice that we hear and determine this appeal. The decision of the Court of Appeal on Mr Stockman’s recall application involves no issue of general or public importance, nor is there any appearance of a miscarriage of justice. The same is true of the Court of Appeal’s decision on costs which Mr Stockman sought to recall.  [5] The application for leave to appeal is dismissed. As the respondent made no submissions, we make no order for costs.

REASONS  [1] Mr Rabson applies for the recall of the Court’s judgment in Rabson v Chapman1 dismissing his application for leave to appeal.  [2] Mr Rabson submits that the judgment was a nullity as the underlying appeal in the Court of Appeal had been deemed abandoned. In particular he says that no award of costs should have been made by this Court.  [3] We do not accept that submission. Mr Rabson filed the application for leave in this Court. He did not withdraw it. It therefore had to be determined. The respondent filed submissions and was entitled to costs.  1 Rabson v Chapman [2014] NZSC 112.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 35/2015 [2016] NZSC 16   BETWEEN  R (SC 35/2015) Applicant   AND  THE QUEEN Respondent   Court:  William Young, Arnold and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person M J Lillico for Respondent   Judgment:  24 February 2016     JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.   REASONS  [1] The applicant was found guilty at trial on counts alleging sexual violation by rape and assault. The offending was against his young daughter. His appeal against conviction was dismissed by the Court ofAppeal.1  [2] His application for leave to appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal is primarily based on his suspicion that there was an association between the  R (CA151/2013) v R [2013] NZCA542 (Wild,Cooper and Lang JJ).  R (SC 35/2015) v R [2016] NZSC 16[24 February2016]  foreman of the jury and a detective who gave evidence at his trial. He says that both had worked at the same school; the former as a caretaker and the latter as a school teacher.   [3] This ground of appeal was not advanced to the Court of Appeal. In those circumstances we invited counsel for the Crown to make inquiries. We were subsequentlyadvised that:  (a)  The detective has not worked at the school since 2006.   (b)  While at the school he had an association with one of the caretakers who was employed there but this person was not on the jury.   (c)  He recalls another person, whom he knew as “Dave”, who worked at the school as a caretaker but cannot say whether he was the foreman as he would not now recognise him.    On the basis of the submissions we received from the applicant in response to what wewere told bycounsel, wedoubt whether “Dave” was on the jury. Further, even if he was on the jury, we see no basis for concern that his prior limited association with the detective would have affected the jury's assessment of the case. Accordingly, we see no appearance of a miscarriage of justice in relation to this issue.  [4] The applicant in his most recent submissions has raised other points (one as to the evidence of doctors and DNA and the other as to differences between his daughter’s original statement and her evidence). He did not develop any arguments as to these points. Having considered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, we are not persuaded that theywarrant the grant of leave to appeal.

B The applicant is to pay costs of $2,500 to the respondent.    REASONS  [1] This is a second application for leave to appeal against a judgment of the Court ofAppeal of 29 April 2014 striking out an appeal by Mr Rabson and ordering himto paycosts.1 His challengeto thejudgment is based on thepremise that, bythe time the Court of Appeal struck out his appeal, it had already been abandoned by reason of r 43 of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005. His first application for leave to appeal was refused on the basis that he could, if he wished, apply to the Court of Appeal to recall the judgment.2 Some 12 months later he did so. That application is, as we understand, still undetermined.  1 Rabson v Chapman [2014] NZCA158 (O’ReganP,White and Miller JJ). 2 Rabson v Chapman [2014] NZSC 90.  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON vWAYNE SEYMOUR CHAPMAN [2016] NZSC 14 [23February2016]  [2] The present application (which is a second in relation to the same judgment) does not meet the criteria for a grant of leave to appeal. It does not raise a point of law of general or public importance. As well, as there is no impediment to a costs order being made against an appellant in respect of an abandoned appeal, we see no appearance of a miscarriage of justice. More generally, the case is simply of insufficient moment to warrant a grant of leave to appeal.  Solicitors: Buddle Findlay,Wellington for Respondent

REASONS    2   [2] The appeal was filed on 26 November 2015. Any person intending to become a party had 15 working days after the period for lodging a notice of appeal ends to give the requisite notice under s 274 of the Act. The expiry date for lodging an appeal was 3 December 2015 and, taking into account the statutory holidays, the interested party period ended on 14 January 2016.  [3] NZAET filed as 274 notice together with an application under s 281 for waiver on 9 February 2016. This is 17 days out of time. No explanation is offered by NZAET for the delay in filing.  [4] The other parties were asked to advise the court of their position on NZAET' s application by 16 February 2016. No opposition was raised.  [5] In granting a waiver under s 281 of the Resource Management Act 1991, the court must be satisfied that none of the paiiies to the proceeding will be unduly prejudiced.  [6] I cannot see that the granting of the waiver will unduly prejudice any party. On that basis and as the application is unopposed, I am prepared to grant the waiver as sought.  [7] In the future NZAET should take care to provide an explanation when applying for a waiver under s 281 of the Act.  For the Court:  nvironment Judge    
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  SC 129/2015 [2016] NZSC 9   BETWEEN  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON Applicant   AND  TRANSPARENCYINTERNATIONAL NEW ZEALAND INCORPORATED Respondent   Court:  William Young, Arnold and O'Regan JJ   Counsel:  Applicant in person D R Kalderimis and K E Yesberg for Respondent   Judgment:  16 February 2016    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  A The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  B The applicant is to pay the respondent costs of $2,500.    REASONS  [1] By a judgment delivered on 12 November 2015, the Court of Appeal struck out an appeal by the applicant and Mr Creser against Transparency International New Zealand Incorporated and ordered them to paycosts.1  [2] Mr Rabson seeks leave to appeal against that decision. The primary contention he wishes to advance is that by 12 November, the appeal was already abandoned pursuant tor 43 of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005.  Hecomplains that the Court of Appeal wrongly “resurrected” the appeal for the purposes of striking it out and imposing costs.  Rabson v Transparency International New Zealand Inc [2015] NZCA 543 (Wild, Miller and Cooper JJ).  MALCOLM EDWARD RABSON vTRANSPARENCYINTERNATIONALNEWZEALAND INCORPORATED [2016] NZSC 9 [16 February2016]  [3] Mr Rabson had made a timely r 43(2) application for an extension of time which was addressed by Wild J in a minute of 4 August 2015 but not, at least as we read the minute, finally determined. On this basis, the application for an extension of time was still current in November 2015. In those circumstances, it is at least open to question whether the effect of r 43(1) was that the appeal was to be treated as abandoned so as to obviate the need for, or appropriateness of, an order striking it out. If Mr Rabson and Mr Creser considered the appeal to have already been abandoned they could have told the Court they would not pay the security for costs and abandoned their application for an extension of time. They could also have notified the respondent that the strike out application was unnecessary as they did not intend to pursue the appeal further. The strike out application could then have been avoided or, if already made, granted by consent. That would have avoided the incurring of costs by the respondent in relation to the strike out application. They chose not to do any of this.    [4] Accordingly, we see no point of law of general or public importance in the proposed appeal and no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.  Solicitors: ChapmanTripp, WellingtonforRespondent  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  [20 SC 64/2015 16] NZSC 8   BETWEEN  NICHOLAS PAULALFRApplicant  ED  REEKIE   AND  ATTORNEY-GENERAL (BEHALF OFTHE DEPACORRECTIONS) First Respondent  SUED ON RTM ENT OF   ATTORNEY-GENERAL Second Respondent   THE DISTRICT COURTWAITAKERE Third Respondent  AT    Court: Elias CJ, William Young and O'Regan JJ Counsel: Applicant in person  J E Foster and H T N Fong for Respondents Judgment: 15 February 2016  JUDGMENT OF THE COURT  The application for recall is dismissed.  REASONS  [1] The applicant applies for the recall of this Court’s judgment dismissing his application for leave to appeal.1 Although he was represented by counsel in relation to his application for leave, this does not appear to be the case in relation to his application for recall.  Reekie v Attorney-General [2015] NZSC 160.  NICHOLAS PAULALFRED REEKIE vATTORNEY-GENERAL(SUED ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENTOF CORRECTIONS) [2016] NZSC 8[15 February2016]  [2] The applicant says that the Court was wrong to say that there was no suggestion in his application for leave to appeal that the Court of Appeal had wrongly interpreted the requirements of r 29A of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005 or applied the wrong test in determining whether an extension of time to appeal should be granted. The background to this is that the applicant’s appeal to the Court of Appeal was deemed to be abandoned under r 43 of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules. As he had not sought an extension of time within the three month time period set out in r 43(1) of those rules, it was not possible to revive that appeal. However, the applicant sought to commence a new appeal, and he required an extension of time under r29A to do this.  [3] There is clear authoritythat the Court ofAppeal has jurisdiction under r 29A to give an extension of time for the commencement of a new appeal even if the earlier appeal has been deemed to be abandoned under r 43 and an application for its revival has not been made within the three month period, meaning that the original appeal is not able to be revived.2 The applicant’s submission to the contrary is wrong. The existence of this jurisdiction was not disputed, nor was there any suggestion that the Court of Appeal had wrongly interpreted r 29A. Accordingly, there was no error in the judgment of this Court.  [4] The applicant also says that the Court was wrong to say that the applicant’s first appeal was deemed to be abandoned under r 43(1) because he did not file a case on appeal and applyfor ahearingdate within the timespecified in r 43. Hesays that the real reason was that he was unable to paysecurityfor costs, which prevented him from filing the case on appeal and seeking a hearing. There was no inaccuracy in this Court’s judgment. The statement that the applicant did not file a case on appeal and apply for a hearing within the time specified in r 43 was factuallycorrect.  [5] The application for recall is therefore dismissed.

PUBLICATION IN LAW REPORT OR LAW DIGEST PERMITTED.  IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND  AUCKLAND REGISTRY CRI-2016-404-005 [2016] NZHC 156  BETWEEN QUENTIN CULLEN Appellant  AND NEW ZEALAND POLICE Respondent  Hearing: 12 February 2016  Appearances: M Pecotic for the Appellant F Culliney for the Respondent  Judgment: 12 February 2016  ORAL JUDGMENT OF WOODHOUSE J  Solicitors / Counsel: Ms M Pecotic, Barrister, Auckland Ms F Culliney, Meredith Connell, Office of the Crown Solicitor, Auckland  CULLEN v POLICE [2016] NZHC 156 [12 February 2016]  [1] Having received helpful written submissions for the appellant and for the respondent, and further careful oral submissions for both parties, I have concluded that the appeal should be allowed and Mr Cullen therefore should be granted bail.  Because of time constraints that I have explained to counsel I am not able at this point to deliver an oral judgment, although I would much prefer to do so. Accordingly, the reasons are to follow as soon as possible.  [2] Mr Cullen is granted bail on the following conditions:  (a)  He is to live with his brother at 175K Harris Road, East Tamaki. This bail address has not been checked by Police. Because of that leave is granted to the Crown to bring the matter back before the District Court, being the approach agreed by counsel.  It is anticipated that this will be able to be dealt with by way of variation of conditions of bail.   (b)  Mr Cullen is to be subject to a curfew to be at that address at all times between 9:30 pm and 5:00 am.   (c)  Mr Cullen is to present himself at the door during those curfew hours if required by Police.   (d)  Mr Cullen is not to be in possession of any sort of firearm or ammunition at any time or in any place.   (e)  Mr Cullen is to provide his personal recognisance to answer to bail and to comply with the conditions by depositing a cash sum of $5,000. That will be a payment into this Court to be managed by the Registrar in the appropriate way.    [3] Mr Cullen is remanded on bail for his next appearance in the District Court at Waitakere District Court at 10:00 am on 25 February 2016.  Woodhouse J
